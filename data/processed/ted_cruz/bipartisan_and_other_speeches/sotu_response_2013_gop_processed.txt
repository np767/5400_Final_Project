transcript: marco rubio's republican response florida senator provides official response to president obama by abc news february 12, 2013, 10:39 pm &#151; -- the official republican state of the union response by marco rubio (as prepared for delivery) good evening. i am marco rubio. i am blessed to represent florida in the united states senate. let me begin by congratulating president obama on the start of his second term. tonight, i have the honor of responding to his state of the union address on behalf of my fellow republicans. and i am especially honored to be addressing our brave men and women serving in the armed forces and in diplomatic posts around the world. you may be thousands of miles away, but you are always in our prayers. the state of the union address is always a reminder of how unique america is. for much of human history, most people were trapped in stagnant societies, where a tiny minority always stayed on top, and no one else even had a chance. but america is exceptional because we believe that every life, at every stage, is precious, and that everyone everywhere has a god-given right to go as far as their talents and hard work will take them. like most americans, for me this ideal is personal. my parents immigrated here in pursuit of the opportunity to improve their life and give their children the chance at an even better one. they made it to the middle class, my dad working as a bartender and my mother as a cashier and a maid. i did not inherit any money from them. but i inherited something far better – the real opportunity to accomplish my dreams. this opportunity – to make it to the middle class or beyond no matter where you start out in life – it is not bestowed on us from washington. it comes from a vibrant free economy where people can risk their own money to open a business. and when they succeed, they hire more people, who in turn invest or spend the money they make, helping others start a business and create jobs. presidents in both parties – from john f. kennedy to ronald reagan – have known that our free enterprise economy is the source of our middle class prosperity. but president obama? he believes it is the cause of our problems. that the economic downturn happened because our government did not tax enough, spend enough and control enough. and, therefore, as you heard tonight, his solution to virtually every problem we face is for washington to tax more, borrow more and spend more. this idea – that our problems were caused by a government that was too small – it is just not true. in fact, a major cause of our recent downturn was a housing crisis created by reckless government policies. national guard shooting 'act of evil,' trump says; suspect id'd as afghan national 16 minutes ago judge tosses indictments against james comey and letitia james nov 24, 4:06 pm teen on cruise ship possibly died by asphyxiation resulting from bar hold: source nov 21, 2:20 pm and the idea that more taxes and more government spending is the best way to help hardworking middle class taxpayers – that is an old idea that is failed every time it is been tried. more government is not going to help you get ahead. it is going to hold you back. more government is not going to create more opportunities. it is going to limit them. and more government is not going to inspire new ideas, new businesses and new private sector jobs. it is going to create uncertainty.because more government breeds complicated rules and laws that a small business cannot afford to follow. because more government raises taxes on employers who then pass the costs on to their employees through fewer hours, lower pay and even layoffs. and because many government programs that claim to help the middle class, often end up hurting them instead. sponsored content by taboola national guard shooting 'act of evil,' trump says; suspect id'd as afghan national 16 minutes ago teen on cruise ship possibly died by asphyxiation resulting from bar hold: source nov 21, 2:20 pm judge tosses indictments against james comey and letitia james nov 24, 4:06 pm trump admin live updates: trump sending witkoff to meet with putin nov 26, 5:23 pm abc news live 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events
