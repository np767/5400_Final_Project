jd vance well let me say to the thousands of americans who traveled from distant towns and across state lines to be here today this is your national capital welcome to washington dc we are thrilled to have you this evening as we celebrate the 250th anniversary of the united states army the oldest branch of the greatest fighting force ever known to man i want to say to all the soldiers all across our nations capital and all across the world happy birthday soldiers were proud of you and i wanna say you represent an unbroken line of greatness of excellence and one of the things the president of the united states has told his entire administration from the vice president ol on down is that we must remember that the young men and women who put on the uniform and serve this nation are our most precious resource we must honor them we must respect them we must fight for them and thats exactly what the trump administration aims to do every single day and so to our soldiers were so proud of you and let me tell you that the way that we honor and respect you is number one we never ask you to go to war unless you absolutely have to and number two when we do ask you to go to war we give you the weapons and the support needed to kick the hell outta the enemy and come back home safely now i know i am the last thing standing between the main event and that is a dangerous place to be with a lot of soldiers in the audience so let me just say a couple of quick additional thoughts first of all june the 14th is of course the birthday of the army it is of course the birthday of the president of the united states and happy birthday mr president but i would get in trouble if i didnt mention that its also my wedding anniversary and so do my lovely wife i love you honey happy anniversary and

recipients of the congressional medal of honor we love you we honor you and we salute your noble service to our flag and to our country as we celebrate tonight we also think of the hundreds of thousands of army soldiers who have made the supreme sacrifice for our nation and selflessly laid down their lives in every war from the revolution to the war on terror to the gold star families with us today the courage of your heroes is the bedrock on which our entire nation stands we thank you yes we thank you today we commemorate an event that did not just change american history but changed the history of the entire world with the creation of americas army on june 14th 1775 liberty got its shield and the freedom got its sword those first army patriots in the american revolution fought against a fearsome enemy and impossible odds but they were armed with a righteous cause they were led by an indomitable commander a truly great man general george washington and they were united by an eternal creed their motto was victory or death over the past two and a half centuries our warriors have shown unrivaled valor on fields and battle around the globe with the frostbitten feet and bloody fists they have marched into the flames and fury of combat charged up mountains stormed beaches waded through torrents of gunfire and leapt into skies thick with smoke and shrapnel the us army has driven bayonets into the heart of sinister empires crushed the ambitions of evil tyrants beneath the threads of american tanks its done so well its done so much and sent the devil himself flying into full retreat time and again americas enemies have learned that if you threaten the american people our soldiers are coming for you your defeat will be certain your demise will be final and your downfall will be total and complete because our soldiers never give up never surrender and never ever quit they fight fight fight and they win win win and thats why no institution in history has entered more names into the roster of american heroes than the us army the congressional medal of honor more than anyone or anything there was mad anthony wayne asked by george washington to lead a daring midnight raid up the cliffs of stony point with unloaded muskets and only their bayonets to fight the redcoats mad anthony replied issue the order sir and i will storm into hell for you then there was the civil war general john corse shot in the face in combat he fired off a message to his commander i am short a cheekbone and one ear but i am able to whip the hell out of all of them he stayed on the front lines it seemed forever in world war ii there was the great creighton abrams besieged on all sides by the nazis at the battle of the bulge he boldly proclaimed theyve got us surrounded again the poor bastards this is the fighting spirit and unyielding force of the us army it has never changed and it will never ever change because there is no earthly force more powerful than the brave heart of a us infantrymen or an army ranger paratrooper or green beret they are the best they are the finest from bunker hill to san juan hill from gettysburg to guadalcanal from yorktown to shiloh and from the trenches of the argonne to the mountains of afghanistan the army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage untold sacrifice and unequaled and undying glory our soldiers have poured out their blood by the bucketful on missionary ridge and heartbreak ridge on the sands of sicily normandy and the philippines and on the dusty streets of da nang baghdad and fallujah thanks to their extraordinary service and devotion 250 years later america stands tall america stands proud and america stands free were the hottest country in the world right now and our country will soon be greater and stronger than ever before down through history weve been blessed beyond words by this valiant legion of army warriors and patriots heroes and legends and tonight we affirm with
