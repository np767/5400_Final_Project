president he was one of the most successful businessmen in the world he had everything anyone could ever want in a life and yet instead of choosing the easy path he chose to endure abuse slander and persecutionneed a news break check out the all new play hub with puzzles games and morebut don’t take my word for it go and watch the video of a wouldbe assassin coming a quarter of an inch from

overwhelmed with gratitude to sayi officially accept your nomination to be vice president of the united states of americanever in my wildest imagination would i have believed that i could be standing here tonightwho is jd vance ohioans have notsopretty things to say about trumps vp picki grew up in middletown ohio a small town where people spoke their minds built with their hands and loved their god family community and country with their whole heartsbut it was also a place that had been cast aside and forgotten by america’s ruling class in washingtonwhen i was in the fourth grade a career politician by the name of joe biden supported nafta a bad trade deal that sent countless good american manufacturing jobs to mexicowhen i was a sophomore in high school a career politician by the name of joe biden gave china a sweetheart trade deal that destroyed even more good middle class jobsand when i was a senior in high school joe biden supported the disastrous invasion of iraqand at each step of the way in small towns like mine in ohio or next door in pennsylvania or in michigan and other states across our country jobs were sent overseas and children were sent to warsomehow a real estate developer from new york by the name of donald trump was right on all of these issues while joe biden was wrong donald trump knew even then that we needed leaders who would put america firstthanks to these policies that biden and the other outoftouch politicians in washington gave us our country was flooded with cheap chinese goods and cheap foreign labor… and in the decades to come deadly chinese fentanyljoe biden screwed up and my community paid the pricenow i was lucky despite the closing factories and the growing addiction in towns like mine in my life i had a guardian angel by my side she was an old woman who could barely walk but was tough as nailsi called her “mamaw” the name we hillbillies gave to our grandmothersmamaw raised me as her own as my own mother struggled with addictionthanks to mamaw things worked out for meafter 911 i did what thousands of other young men my age did in that time of soaring patriotism and love of country i enlisted in the united states marinesi left the marines after four years and went to the ohio state and then to law school at yale—where i met my beautiful wife—and then started businesses to create jobs in the kinds of places i grew upmy work taught me that there is still so much talent and grit in the american heartland but for these places to thrive we need a leader who fights for the people who built this countrywe need president donald j trumpsome people tell me i’ve lived the american dream and they are rightbut the american dream that always counted most was not starting a business or becoming a senator or even being here with you fine people it was becoming a good husband and a good dad and of giving my family the things i never had as a kidand that’s the accomplishment i’m proudest ofthat tonight i’m joined by my beautiful wife usha an incredible lawyer and a better mom and our three kids— ewan vivek mirabel—hopefully in bedthings did not work out well for a lot kids i grew up with every now and then i will get a call from a relative back home who asks did you know “so and so” and i’ll remember a face from years ago and then i’ll hear “they died of an overdose”as always america’s ruling class wrote the checks communities like mine paid the pricefor decades that divide between the few with their power and comfort in washington and the rest of us only widenedfrom iraq to afghanistan from the financial crisis to the great recession from open borders to stagnating wages the people who govern this country have failed and failed againthat is until president donald j trump came alongdonald trump represents america’s last best hope to restore what – if lost – may never be found againbut my fellow americans this moment is not about me it’s about all of us and who we’re fighting forit’s about the auto worker in michigan wondering why out of touch politicians are destroying your jobsit’s about the factory worker in wisconsin who makes things with their hands and is proud of american craftsmanshipit’s about the energy worker in pennsylvania and ohio who doesn’t understand why joe biden is willing to buy energy from tinpot dictators but not hardworking americans right here at homebuckeye state jd vance would be first ohio resident to be vice president is first in 80 years on ticketand it’s about single moms like mine who struggled with money and addiction but never gave upand i am proud to say that tonight my mom is here 10 years clean and soberi love you momits about grandparents all across this country who are living on social security and raising grandchildren they didnt expect to raisejoe biden has been a politician in washington for longer than ive been alivefor halfacentury hes been the champion of every major policy initiative to make america weaker and poorerin four years donald trump reversed decades of betrayals inflicted by joe biden and the rest of the corrupt washington insidershe created the greatest economy in history for workers just imagine what he can do with four more years in the white housemonths ago i heard some young family member observe that their parents’ generation—the baby boomers—could afford to buy a home when they first entered the workforce “but i don’t know if i’ll ever be able to afford a home” they said sadlythe absurd cost of housing is the result of many failures of america’s leadership class and i can tell you exactly how it happenedwall street barons crashed the economy and american builders went out of businessas tradesmen scrambled for jobs houses stopped being builtthe lack of good jobs led to stagnant wagesthen democrats flooded the country with illegal immigrantsso citizens had to compete – with people who shouldn’t even be here – for precious housingjoe biden’s inflation crisis is really an affordability crisismany of the people that i grew up with cant afford to pay more for groceries more for gas more for rent and thats exactly what joe biden’s economy has given them so prices soared and dreams were shatteredand china and the cartels sent fentanyl across the border adding addiction to the heartachebut that’s not the end of our storywe’ve heard about the villains and their victims but let me tell you about the futurepresident trump’s vision is simple we won’t cater to wall street we’ll commit to the working manwe won’t import foreign labor we’ll fight for american citizenswe won’t buy energy from countries that hate us we’ll get it right here from american workerswe won’t sacrifice our supply chains to unlimited global trade we’ll stamp every product made in the usa we will build factories again put people to work making real products for american families made with the hands of american workerstogether we will protect the wages of american workers—union and nonunion alike—and stop the chinese communist party from building their middle class on the backs of our hardworking citizenstogether we will make our allies share in the burden of securing world peace no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the american taxpayertogether we will send our kids to war only when we mustelection 2024 what has jd vance written about state national issuesbut as president trump showed with the elimination of isis when we punch we will punch hardtogether we will put the citizens of america first whatever the color of their skin we will in short make america great again i am married to the daughter of south asian immigrants to this country incredible people people who genuinely have enriched the country in so many
