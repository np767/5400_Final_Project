vance 0000 wow wow speaker 1 0025 jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd vance 0027 first of all arenât i a lucky guy isnât she lovely amazing greetings milwaukee my fellow americans and my fellow republicans my name is jd vance from the great state of ohio tonight speaker 1 0102 ohio ohio ohio jd vance 0102 ohio ohio speaker 1 0102 ohio ohio jd vance 0106 you guys weâre going to chill with the ohio love weâve got to win michigan too here my friends tonight is a night of hope a celebration of what america once was and with godâs grace what it will soon be again speaker 1 0136 yeah jd vance 0136 and it is a reminder of the sacred duty we have to preserve the american experiment to choose a new path for our children and grandchildren but as we meet tonight we cannot forget that this evening could have been so much different instead of a day of celebration this could have been a day of heartache and mourning for the last eight years president trump has given everything he has to fight for the people of our country 0214 he didnât need politics but the country needed him inaudible 000222 now prior to running for president he was one of the most successful businessmen in the world he had everything anyone could ever want in a life and yet instead of choosing the easy path he chose to endure abuse slander and persecution and he did it because he loves this country 0251 i want all americans to go and watch the video of a wouldbe assassin coming a quarter of an inch from taking his life consider the lies they told you about donald trump and then look at that photo of him defiant fist in the air when donald trump rose to his feet in that pennsylvania field all of america stood with him speaker 1 0326 fight fight fight fight fight fight jd vance 0334 and what did he call us to do for our country to fight speaker 1 0336 to fight yeah jd vance 0338 to fight for america even in his most perilous moment we were on his mind his instinct was for us for our country to call us to something higher to something greater to once again be citizens who ask what our country needs of us now consider what they said they said he was a tyrant they said he must be stopped at all costs but how did he respond he called for national unity for national calm literally right after an assassin nearly took his life 0423 he remembered the victims of the terrible attack especially the brave corey comperatore who gave his life to protect his family god bless him and then president trump flew to milwaukee and got back to work now thatâs the man iâve gotten to know personally over the last few years he is tough and he is but he cares about people he can stand defiant against an assassin one moment and call for national healing the next 0504 he is a beloved father and grandfather and of course a once in a generation business leader heâs the man who is feared by americaâs adversaries but two nights ago and iâll share a moment said goodnight to his two boys told them he loved them and made sure to give each of them a kiss on the cheek and i will say don and eric squirmed the same way my fouryearold does when his daddy tries to give them a kiss on the cheek sorry guys he is all those things but tonight we celebrate he is our once and future president of the united states of america 0540 now i want to respond to his call for unity myself we have a big tent in this party on everything from national security to economic policy but my message to you my fellow republicans is we love this country and we are united to win right now i think our disagreements actually make us stronger thatâs what iâve learned in my time in the united states senate where sometimes i persuade my colleagues and sometimes they persuade me 0639 and my message to my fellow americans those watching from across the country is shouldnât we be governed by a party that is unafraid to debate ideas and come to the best solution thatâs the republican party of the next four years united in our love for this country and committed to free speech and the open exchange of ideas and so tonight mr chairman i stand here humbled and iâm overwhelmed with gratitude to say i officially accept your nomination to be vice president of the united states of america speaker 1 0727 jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd vance 0749 thank you now never in my wildest imagination could i have believed that iâd be standing here tonight i grew up in middletown ohio a small town where people spoke their minds built with their hands and loved their god their family their community and their country with their whole hearts speaker 1 0817 amen jd vance 0819 but it was also a place that had been cast aside and forgotten by americaâs ruling class in washington when i was in the fourth grade a career politician by the name of joe biden supported nafta a bad trade deal that sent countless good jobs to mexico when i was a sophomore in high school that same career politician named joe biden gave china a sweetheart trade deal that destroyed even more good american middleclass manufacturing jobs 0854 when i was a senior in high school that same joe biden supported the disastrous invasion of iraq and at each step of the way in small towns like mine in ohio or next door in pennsylvania or michigan in states all across our country jobs were sent overseas and our children were sent to war speaker 1 0938 joe biden inaudible 000939 jd vance 0941 i agree and somehow a real estate developer from new york city by the name of donald j trump was right on all of these issues while biden was wrong president trump knew even then that we needed jd vance 1000 â¦ leaders who would put america first 1009 now thanks to these policies that biden and other outoftouch politicians in washington gave us our country was flooded with cheap chinese goods with cheap foreign labor and in the decades to come deadly chinese fentanyl joe biden screwed up and my community paid the price now i was lucky despite the closing factories and the growing addiction in towns like mine in my life i had a guardian angel by my side she was an old woman who could barely walk but she was tough as nails i called her mamaw the name we hillbillies gave to our grandmothers mamaw raised me as her own â¦ excuse me mamaw raised me as my mother struggled with addiction mamaw was in so many ways a woman of contradiction she loved the lord ladies and gentlemen she was a woman of very deep christian faith but she also loved the fword iâm not kidding she could make a sailor blush 1127 now she once told me when she found out that i was spending too much time with a local kid who was known for dealing drugs that if i ever hung out with that kid again she would run him over with her car thatâs true and she said âjd no one will ever find out about itâ now thanks to that mamaw things worked out for me after 911 i did what thousands of other young men my age did in that time of soaring patriotism and love of country i enlisted in the united states marines semper fidelis to my fellow marines i left the marines after four years and went to the ohio state university iâm sorry michigan i had to get that in there come on come on weâve had enough political violence 1305 now after ohio state i went to yale law school where i met my beautiful wife and then i started businesses to create jobs in the kind of places that i grew up in 1314 now my work taught me that there is still so much talent and grit in the american heartland there really is but for these places to thrive my friends we need a leader who fights for the people who built this country we need a leader whoâs not in the pocket of big business but answers to the working man union and nonunion alike a leader who wonât sell out to multinational corporations but will stand up for american companies and american industry a leader who rejects joe biden and kamala harris green new scam and fights to bring back our great american factories we need president donald j trump 1427 some people tell me iâve lived the american dream and of course theyâre right and iâm so grateful for it but the american dream that always counted most was not starting a business or becoming a senator or even being here with you fine people though itâs pretty awesome my most important american dream was becoming a good husband and a good dad thank you i wanted to give my kids the things that i didnât have when i was growing up and thatâs the accomplishment that iâm proudest of that tonight iâm joined by my beautiful wife usha an incredible lawyer and a better mom and our three beautiful kids ewan whoâs seven vivek whoâs four and mirabel whoâs two now theyâre back at the hotel and kids if youâre watching daddy loves you very much but get your butts in bed itâs 10 oâclock 1527 but my friends things did not work out well for a lot of kids i grew up with every now and then i will get a call from a relative back home who asks âdid you know soandsoâ and iâll remember a face from years ago and then iâll hear they died of an overdose as always americaâs ruling class wrote the checks communities like mine paid the price for decades that divide between the few with their power and comfort in washington and the rest of us only widened from iraq to afghanistan from the financial crisis to the great recession from open borders to stagnating wages the people who govern this country have failed and failed again 1616 that is of course until a guy named donald j trump came along president trump represents americaâs last best hope to restore what if lost may never be found again a country where a working class boy born far from the halls of power can stand on this stage as the next vice president of the united states of america but my fellow americans here in this stage and watching at home this moment is not about me itâs about all of us and itâs about who weâre fighting for itâs about the auto worker in michigan wondering why out of touch politicians are destroying their jobs itâs about the factory worker in wisconsin who makes things with their hands and is proud of american craftsmanship it is about the energy worker in pennsylvania and ohio who doesnât understand why joe biden is willing to buy energy from tin pot dictators across the world when he could buy it from his own citizens right here in our own country you guys are a great crowd wow audience 1844 yes we are yes we are yes we are yes we are yes we are yes we are yes we are yes we are yes we are yes we are yes we are yes we are yes we are jd vance 1851 and our movement is about single moms like mine who struggled with money and addiction but never gave up and iâm proud to say that tonight my mom is here 10 years clean and sober i love you mom audience 1903 jdâs mom jdâs mom jdâs mom jdâs mom jdâs mom jdâs mom jdâs mom jdâs mom jdâs mom jd vance 2006 and you know mom i was thinking itâll be 10 years officially in january of 2025 and if president trumpâs okay with it letâs have the celebration in the white house and our movement ladies and gentlemen itâs about grandparents all across this country who are living on social security and raising grandchildren they didnât expect to raise 2047 and while weâre on the topic of grandparents let me tell you another mamaw story now my mamaw died shortly before i left for iraq in 2005 and when we went through her things we found 19 loaded handguns now the thing is they were stashed all over her house under her bed in her closet in the silverware drawer and we wondered what was going on and it occurred to us that towards the end of her life mamaw couldnât get around so well 2133 and so this frail old woman made sure that no matter where she was she was within armâs length of whatever she needed to protect her family thatâs who we fight for thatâs american spirit now joe biden has been a politician in washington for longer than iâve been alive 39 years old kamala harris is not much further behind for half a century heâs been the champion of every major policy initiative to make america weaker and poorer and in four short years donald trump reversed decades of betrayals inflicted by joe biden and the rest of the corrupt washington insiders 2248 he created the greatest economy in history for workers really was amazing thereâs this chart that shows worker wages and they stagnated for pretty much my entire life until president donald j trump came along workersâ wages went through the roof and just imagine what heâs going to do when we give him four more years months ago i heard some young family member observe that their parentsâ generation the baby boomers could afford to buy a home when they first entered the workforce but i donât know this person observed if iâll ever be able to afford a home the absurd cost of housing is the result of so many failures and it reveals so much about whatâs broken in washington i can tell you exactly how it happened wall street barons crashed the economy and american builders went out of business as tradesmen scrambled for jobs houses stopped being built the lack of good jobs of course led to stagnant wages and then the democrats flooded this country with millions of illegal aliens so citizens had to compete with people who shouldnât even be here for precious housing joe bidenâs inflation crisis my friends is really an affordability crisis and many of the people that i grew up with canât afford to pay more for groceries more for gas more for rent and thatâs exactly what joe bidenâs economy has given them so prices soared dreams were shattered and china and the cartel sent fentanyl across the border adding addiction to the heartache but ladies and gentlemen that is not the end of our story 2528 weâve heard about villains and their victims iâve talked a lot about that but let me tell you about the future president trumpâs vision is so simple and yet so powerful weâre done ladies and gentlemen catering to wall street weâll commit to the working man we are done importing foreign labor weâre going to fight for american citizens and their good jobs and their good wages weâre done buying energy from countries that hate us weâre going to get it right here from american workers in pennsylvania and ohio and across the country 2623 we are done sacrificing supply chains to unlimited global trade and weâre going to stamp more and more products with that beautiful label âmade in the usaâ weâre going to build factories again put people to work making real products for american families made with the hands of american workers together we will protect the wages of american workers and stop the chinese communist party from building their middle class on the backs of american citizens together we will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the american taxpayer 2745 together we will send our kids to war only when we must but as president trump showed with the elimination of isis and so much more when we punch weâre going to punch hard together we will put the citizens of america first whatever the color of their skin we will in short make america great again one of the things that you hear people say sometimes is that america is an idea and to be clear america was indeed founded on brilliant ideas like the rule of law and religious liberty things written into the fabric of our constitution and our nation 2847 but america is not just an idea it is a group of people with a shared history and a common future it is in short a nation now it is part of that tradition of course that we welcome newcomers but when we allow newcomers into our american family we allow them on our terms thatâs the way we preserve the continuity of this project from 250 years past to hopefully 250 years in the future and let me illustrate this with a story if i may iâm of course married to the daughter of south asian immigrants to this country incredible people people who genuinely have enriched this country in so many ways and of course iâm biased because i love my wife and her family but itâs true now when i proposed to my wife we were in law school and i said honey i come with 120000 worth of law school debt and a cemetery plot on a mountainside in eastern kentucky jd vance 3000 and i guess standing here tonight itâs just gotten weirder and weirder honey but thatâs what she was getting now that cemetery plot in eastern kentucky is near my familyâs ancestral home and like a lot of people we came from the mountains of appalachia into the factories of ohio pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin 3038 now thatâs kentucky coal country one of the 10â¦ now itâs one of the 10 poorest counties in the entire united states of america theyâre very hardworking people and theyâre very good people theyâre the kind of people who would give you the shirt off their back even if they canât afford enough to eat and our media calls them privileged and looks down on them but they love this country not only because itâs a good idea but because in their bones they know that this is their home and it will be their childrenâs home and they would die fighting to protect it that is the source of americaâs greatness as a united states senator i get to represent millions of people in the great state of ohio with similar stories and it is the great honor of my life now in that cemetery there are people who are born around the time of the civil war and if as i hope my wife and i are eventually laid to rest there and our kids follow us there will be seven generations just in that small mountain cemetery plot in eastern kentucky seven generations of people who have fought for this country who have built this country who have made things in this country and who would fight and die to protect this country if they were asked to 3219 now thatâs not just an idea my friends thatâs not just a set of principle even though the ideas and the principles are great that is a homeland that is our homeland people will not fight for abstractions but they will fight for their home and if this movement of ours is going to succeed and if this country is going to thrive our leaders have to remember that america is a nation and its citizens deserve leaders who put its interests first now we wonât agree on every issue of course not even in this room we may disagree from time to time about how best to reinvigorate american industry and renew american family thatâs fine in fact itâs more than fine itâs good but never forget that the reason why this united republican party exists why we do this why we care about those great ideas and that great history is that we want this nation to thrive for centuries to come 3341 now eventually in that mountain cemetery my children will lay me to rest and when they do i would like them to know that thanks to the work of this republican party the united states of america and as strong and as proud and as great as ever that is who we serve my friends that is who we fight for and the only thing that we need to do right now the most important thing that we can do for those people for that american nation that we all love is to reelect donald j trump president of the united states mr president i will never take for granted the trust you have put in me and what an honor it is to help achieve the extraordinary vision that you have for this country now i pledge to every american no matter your party i will give you everything i have to serve you and to make this country a place where every dream you have for yourself your family and your country will be possible once again 3523 and i promise you one more thing to the people of middletown ohio and all the forgotten communities in michigan wisconsin pennsylvania and ohio and every corner of our nation i promise you this i will be a vice president who never forgets where he came from audience 3540 jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd jd inaudible 003603 jd vance 3604 and every single day for the next four years when i walk into that white house to help president trump i will be doing it for you for your family for your future and for this great country thank you god bless all of you and god bless our great country topicsno items foundhungry for
