afternoon everybody we just had a very frank conversation with the senate and house democratic leadership look the principle at stake here is very simple we have disagreements about tax policy but you dont shut the government down we have disagreements about healthcare policy but you dont shut the government down you dont use your policy disagreements as leverage to not pay our troops to not have essential services of government actually function you dont say the fact that you disagree about a particular tax provision is an excuse for shutting down to the peoples government and all the essential services that come along with it if you look at what chuck schumer has said in the past consistently its whatever our disagreements are lets negotiate with them lets talk about them lets figure out a bipartisan solution but you dont shut the government down in other words you dont put a gun to the american peoples head and say unless you do exactly what senate and house democrats want you to do were going to shut down your government thats exactly what theyre proposing out there 0052now we have to remember theyre very frustrated they say that theyre very frustrated about the fact that this negotiation has not taken place until today but if you look at the original thing they did with this negotiation it was a 15 trillion spending package basically saying to the american people we want to give massive amounts of money hundreds of billions of dollars to illegal aliens for their healthcare while americans are struggling to pay their healthcare bills that was their initial foray into this negotiation we thought it was absurd we told them it was absurd and now they come in here saying that if you dont give us everything that we want were going to shut down the government we think thats preposterous we think its totally unacceptable and we think the american people are going to suffer because these guys wont do the right thing 0135now i want to make one final point here you will hear a lot from senate democrats from house democrats about the fact that american healthcare policy is broken well we know that american healthcare policy is broken weve been trying to fix it for the eight months that weve been in office but every single thing that they accuse about being broken about american healthcare is policy the democrats have supported for the past decade so if they want to talk about how to fix american healthcare policy lets do it the speaker would love to do it the senate majority leader would love to do it lets work on it together but lets do it in the context of an open government thats providing essential services to the american people thats all that were proposing to do and the fact that they refuse to do that shows how unreasonable their position is i think were headed to do a shutdown because the democrats wont do the right thing i hope they changed their mind but were going to see ill let the speakers say a few words speaker 2 0223 thank you vice president vance i want to thank the president as well they showed strong leadership today they invited the four leaders over here because the president is operating in good faith and he demonstrated that very well the problem is that chuck schumer and leader jeffries refused to acknowledge the simple facts lets review what the simple facts are as the vice president was saying this is the common sense thing to do this is the right thing to do this is the simple thing to do by way of review the house is getting back to the way the regular appropriations process is supposed to work 12 separate appropriations bills passed through the house appropriations committee three off the floor the senate doing their work as well all this in bipartisan fashion by the way they passed three bills in the senate those bills dont match up exactly 0308so for the first time in years since 2019 you have a conference committee that is being constituted between the house and the senate this is the way a bill becomes a law they work out the differences all this is happening in bipartisan fashion the problem is weve run out of clock september 30th is the end of the fiscal year so we need a little more time so what we did in the republican majority is the right responsible simple thing a clean continuing resolution a shortterm nonpartisan continuing resolution its only 24 pages in length leader thune has a copy if you want to see the exhibit theres nothing partisan in here no policy writers none of our big party preferences because we want to do the right thing by the american people and allow more time for negotiation 0351now theres a reason that chuck schumer and hakeem jeffries have come out here stomped the feet saying that they cant go along with this theyre trying to bring in extraneous issues they issued a counterproposal you should go take a look at what they requested 15 trillion in new spending that is unrelated to the ongoing appropriations process they wanted to as you said restore taxpayerfunded benefits okay hardworking taxpayers in america they want to take your funds and give that for benefits to illegal aliens they want to restore that because we got rid of it they want to prop up leftleaning media outlets 500 million they threw in on top of that one and a half trillion dollars on a sevenweek stopgap funding measure were not going to do that they know we cant do that and we never have in the past during the biden administration there were 13 threatened shutdowns the republicans and the minority did the right thing we kept the government open were simply asking for the democrats do the same 0449again i want to thank president trump for the strong solid leadership he listened to the arguments and they just wouldnt acknowledge the simple facts i want to thank vice president here for showing his leadership as well if the democrats make the decision to shut the government down the consequences are on them and i think its absolutely tragic we never said that was a good idea we never believed it is and i want you to remember when we voted in the house we passed it out of the house the house has done its job we did that almost two weeks ago every democrat in the house except one voted to shut the government down that is the record and dont forget it ill ask leader thune to step in here john thune 0526 well thanks mr vice president this right here ladies and gentlemen is what were talking about 24 pages its a continuing resolution to fund the government through november the 21st i dont know where theyre saying this is some huge partisan thing this is something we do fairly routinely and when the democrats had the majority on 13 different occasions they had the majority president biden was in the white house we passed continuing resolutions to fund the government this is purely and simply hostagetaking on behalf of the democrats the republicans are united house republicans senate republicans president trump the house has passed a clean funding resolution to fund the government until november the 21st its clean it is bipartisan and it is shortterm but it gives us enough time to finish the appropriations process which is the way we should be funding the government so republicans in the house and the senate the president united theyve passed the bill 0624this is sitting right now at the senate desk we could pick it up and pass it tonight we could pick it up and pass it tomorrow before the government shuts down and then we dont have a government shutdown it is totally up to the democrats because right now they are the only thing standing between the american people and the government shutting down were all in favor of funding the government and this is something thats been done routinely 13 different times by the democrats when they had the majority so to me its purely a hostagetaking exercise on the part of the democrats we are willing to sit down and work with them on some of the issues they want to talk about whether its the extension of premium tax credits with reforms were happy to have that conversation but as of right now this is a hijacking of the american people and its the american people are going to pay the price jd vance 0714 russ do you want to say a few words russell vought 0716 sure sure we want to keep this government open it is not good for the american people to have the government shut down for any period of time we will manage it appropriately but it is something that can all be avoided it can all be avoided by accepting a reasonable position which is what the house has passed and what sits at the senate desk which is to continue to fund the government with a shortterm continuing resolution it has never been a viewpoint that one and a half trillion dollars is a reasonable amount of spending to be included on a shortterm cr this is hostagetaking it is not something that we are going to accept and we hope that the democrats come back from the brink fund this government and allow us to move forward thank you jd vance 0801 right whats up speaker 5 0803 mr vice president so just to be clear is there room for negotiation here with democrats and you mentioned you believe that we are headed toward a government shutdown is the federal government preparing to fire federal workers if the government does indeed shutdown jd vance 0814 well first of all we have to keep essential services functioning as well as possible if the democrats shut down the government and russ has been tasked with making sure thats possible now asked about negotiations one of the things i admired about the president but frankly the entire teams approach during the conversation we just had with chuck schumer and hakeem jeffries was yeah they have some crazy ideas giving taxpayer money to illegal aliens for healthcare thats a crazy idea funding transgender surgeries in peru thats a crazy idea but they had some ideas that i actually thought were reasonable and they had some ideas that the president thought was reasonable whats not reasonable is to hold those ideas as leverage and to shut down the government unless we give you everything that you want 0850there were multiple times where leader jeffries or leader schumer would say you know what we should be doing this and the president of the united states would say yeah absolutely lets have that conversation but were going to do it in the context of the peoples government being open were not going to let you take the peoples government hostage and then give you everything that you want and thats really the state of the negotiation yeah lets have a conversation lets have a negotiation but were not going to shut down the government because we wont give the democrats everything that they want caitlin speaker 6 0917 mr vice president can you respond to what senator schumer said that there were aspects about healthcare and being certain people that the president was learning about for the first time in that meeting and was the president open to a deal on the aca subsidies jd vance 0928 well im highly skeptical that the president was learning about it for the first time thanks to chuck schumer but what i will say is look we have put a 50 billion rural hospital fund into the actual big beautiful bill that we passed a few months ago because we know that under biden administrations policies there are a lot of smalltown hospitals a lot of rural healthcare that was getting shut down and that was struggling were trying to fix that problem in fact were happy to work with democrats to fix that problem we want to work across the aisle to make sure that people have access to good healthcare we are not going to let democrats shut down the government take a hostage unless we give them everything that they want thats not how the peoples government has ever worked thats certainly not how its going to work under the trump administration go ahead please speaker 2 1009 this is very important on healthcare their counterproposal what chuck schumer and hakeem jeffries are demanding is that they claw back the 50 billion that we put into the rural hospital support structure they want to take that back were not going to do that we passed that because we have to allow for that also if they shut the government down not only are troops unpaid federal workers and all the services that everybody relies upon but the wic program the nutrition program women infant and children they will not getâ¦ that program will not be funded fema wont be funded we have hurricanes off the coast of the united states right now this is serious business you have telehealth you have mental health services all that thats funded by the government would stop if chuck schumer and hakeem jeffries and the democrats have their way the democrat shutdown would be damaging for the country we cant allow for it thank you all speaker 7 1058 inaudible 001057 of passing a shorter cr
