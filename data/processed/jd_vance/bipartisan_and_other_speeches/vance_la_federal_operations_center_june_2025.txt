source url transcript of jd vance speech in los angeles mahomet daily vice president jd vance delivered his speech in los angeles at a federal operations center on june 20 amid ongoing immigration raids and days of protests in response president donald trump deployed federal law enforcement and military personnel to the city jd vance all right well good afternoon everybody thank you all for being here and thanks especially to the marines from 29 palms for being here for serving their country and providing some muchneeded security as a matter of fact i just heard from a couple of law enforcement officers basically thank you thank you to the president for sending in the dod officials for sending in the soldiers and marines because unfortunately a lot of these federal buildings were under very serious threat i heard about a lot of that during my tour here today fact check the violence and unrest were largely confined to a few blocks in downtown los angeles not citywide most incidents involved property damage such as burning cars and vandalized storefronts rather than direct attacks on federal buildings themselves while the unrest prompted concern for the security of federal property there is no independent evidence from local reporting that federal buildings were actually breached set on fire or directly assaulted in a way that would constitute a “very serious threat” requiring military intervention the marines and national guard were deployed to “protect federal property and personnel” but as of their arrival they had not needed to detain anyone or directly intervene in attacks on the buildings jd vance and the reason i’m here is i just wanted to hear from the law enforcement officials themselves the state officials the local officials but also the federal officials what’s actually going on here on the ground i think there’s some good news and the good news is the rioting has gotten a lot better but the bad news is as i heard from everybody unfortunately the soldiers and marines are still very much a necessary part of what’s going on here because they’re worried that it’s going to flare back up and what do i mean when i say flair back up i think it’s useful to take stock of what actually happened in the city of los angeles over the past couple of months fact check vance claimed the events happened “over the past couple of months” but this is factually incorrect the protests began on june 6 2025 following ice raids and vance gave this speech on june 20 2025 the entire sequence of events occurred over approximately two weeks not months as of june 16 lapd was on citywide tactical alert and as of june 17 curfew was recinded jd vance so first of all to set the table we have a public official in gavin newsom and los angeles mayor karen bass who over the past few years have actively encouraged illegal migration into this community have strained public services have strained law enforcement and really have offered generous benefits not to american citizens but to illegal immigrants to break the law to come into our country and to receive generous public assistance for having done so what has that done that has created an illegal immigration crisis of course facilitated by the policies of the biden administration and there is perhaps nowhere where that crisis has fallen harder than in the great city of los angeles and you know i landed when i saw the city when i was driving through to come to this fbi building all i could think about is what a great american city los angeles is and what a great tragedy it is that we have allowed illegal immigration and rioting to destroy i think one of the great gems of american of the american family fact check while both officials have supported sanctuary policies and immigrant rights there’s no evidence they encouraged people to enter the country illegally their policies focused on protecting immigrants already in communities rather than encouraging new illegal entry newsom did urge california universities to declare themselves “sanctuary campuses” for undocumented immigrants after trump’s first election however sanctuary policies are designed to encourage cooperation with local law enforcement by removing fear of deportation not to encourage illegal border crossings california and los angeles have provided some benefits to undocumented immigrants newsom signed legislation expanding medical to undocumented californians over 50 years old los angeles county approved 3 million for the la justice fund to provide legal services to undocumented immigrants fighting deportation newsom has supported immigration enforcement against individuals with serious criminal records in february 2025 he announced he would veto a bill from democratic legislators that aimed to restrict state prison officials from cooperating with federal immigration agents newsom argued that california’s existing sanctuary law appropriately balances building trust with immigrant communities and allowing collaboration with ice to remove serious offenders karen bass has been a vocal critic of recent ice operations expressing strong anger at the tactics used and describing them as actions that instill fear in local communities her criticism however has focused on concerns about community safety and the methods of enforcement rather than opposing all forms of immigration enforcement jd vance now these guys surrounding me represent the us attorney’s office the federal bureau of investigation they represent immigration enforcement and of course we just met some marines who represent the department of defense all of these law enforcement officials were necessary because what happened is in response to the basic federal action of enforcing immigration law you had local officials and radical leftwing agitators who actually encouraged violence who facilitated violence and rioting in the great city of los angeles what happened here was a tragedy you had people who were doing the simple job of enforcing the law and they had rioters egged on by the governor and the mayor making it harder for them to do their job that is disgraceful and it is why the president has responded so forcefully what happened in los angeles number one because we’ve got to enforce our borders and get so many of these criminals out of our country to begin with and number two when you have violent agitators who make it impossible for the law enforcement to do their job it is necessary to protect them and to defend them fact check there is no independent evidence that california governor gavin newsom or los angeles mayor karen bass encouraged or facilitated violence or rioting both officials have strongly denied these allegations mayor bass explicitly called vance’s remarks “pure lies” and stated that city officials worked to keep the peace imposed curfews and managed the situation with local law enforcement newsom and bass both criticized the trump administration’s deployment of federal troops arguing it escalated tensions rather than reduced them the lapd and other agencies responded with crowd control measures and the city imposed curfews to restore order lapd reported 10 officers were injured in the protests in los angeles reporters without borders reported 31 attacks on journalists 27 from law enforcement lapd reported 575 arrests the vast majority were curfew and failure to disperse violations jd vance we have to remember that the friday that the riots started before there was ever a single national guardsman before the president of the united states had sent in additional federal resources you had law enforcement officers who were being captured and beaten by violent mobs egged on by gavin newsom and other officials it was necessary to send the national guard to stop that process to bring some order back to this great city and to make it possible for the people’s president to enforce the people’s immigration law fact check cbs news los angeles conducted a factcheck of vance’s specific claim that “there were law enforcement officers who were being captured and beaten by violent mobs egged on by gavin newsom and other officials” their investigation found that lapd lasd the fbi and the chp officials could not point to any specific examples of law enforcement officers being captured and beaten jd vance that’s why we’re here that’s why these guys are standing beside me that’s why we have close to 5000 5000 soldiers and marines from the department of defense it’s because we’ve got to enforce the law the president takes that very seriously i’m happy to take a few questions but before i do i just want to send a message to all of the law enforcement local state and federal who frankly i think are suffering from a bit of a morale problem because they’ve had the local government in this community tell them that they’re not allowed to do their job i just want to let you know from the president the vice president on down this administration stands with you we’re grateful for the job that you do every single day we know that we wouldn’t have a border were it not for your hard work and for your efforts and we’re going to keep on fighting for you and keep on standing with you every step of the way i heard today border patrol officials tell me that they feel like the local government is sticking violent mobs on them when they go out to the community to enforce the nation’s immigration laws can you imagine what it’s like to be a federal official doing your job doing the job the president of the united states ordered you to do and have a mob come after you for following orders and for enforcing the american people’s laws fact check there were documented confrontations between protesters and federal immigration agents in several los angeles county locations including bell maywood and paramount protesters vandalized border patrol vehicles slashed tires smashed windows and in at least one case a civilian rammed and totaled a federal vehicle one suspect was arrested for vehicular assault as a crowd formed and slashed additional tires many communities especially in immigrantheavy neighborhoods have worked to protect their neighbors from masked ice agents who have sought to kidnap people in their homes at work and in entertainment venues videos show neighbors circling the victim or ice agents to protect the immigrant or us citizen at times from undue arrest they’ve also made sure immigrants know their rights jd vance i think it’s disgraceful that we’ve ever gotten to this place in this country but thank god we’ve got a president and an administration that is pushing back against lawlessness fact check president trump has been convicted of 34 felonies and was found liable for sexually abusing e jean carroll he’s also pardoned drug lords insurrectionists and political allies including individuals convicted of serious federal drug crimes leaders of violent gangs and more than 1500 people charged or convicted for their roles in the january 6th capitol attack including members of the proud boys and oath keepers we’re going to keep on doing it every step of the way so thank you to the border patrol thank you to the soldiers and marines thank you to the us attorneys thank you to the fbi thank you to all of you for doing what is necessary to enforce the laws of the american people we are grateful to you and we’ll keep on fighting for you now take a few questions reporter would you say that gavin newsom is endangering law enforcement here in california and what should he be doing if he was protecting them jd vance look i would absolutely say that gavin newsom is endangering law enforcement the law enforcement officials themselves tell me as much that when they go out let’s say you have a border patrol official who needs to go out and arrest somebody maybe a violent criminal who is also an illegal alien when that border patrol agent goes out to do their job they said within 15 minutes of them trying to do their job they have protesters sometimes violent protesters who are in their face obstructing them preventing them from doing their job and endangering their lives why do they have that because those people have been egged on by local officials gavin newsom and karen bass by treating the city as a sanctuary city have basically said that it is open season on federal law enforcement they have treated border patrol and border enforcement as somehow an illegitimate force instead of what they are which is the american people’s law enforcement trying to enforce the american people’s laws fact check los angeles and california’s sanctuary policies are intended to limit local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement not to obstruct or attack federal officers these policies aim to build trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement not to legitimize violence against federal agents no evidence supports the claim that sanctuary policies have made it “open season” on federal law enforcement jd vance so when gavin newsom encourages violence and rioting when he encourages people to get in the face of our great border patrol officers he is absolutely endangering the lives of federal enforcement he’s absolutely endangering the lives of mothers and daughters and fathers and sons who have been sent here to do a simple thing enforce the law fact check no independent evidence supports the claim that newsom or bass encouraged violence against law enforcement both officials have publicly denounced violence and called for peaceful protest mayor bass stated she wanted peaceful demonstrations and condemned violence while newsom criticized federal enforcement sweeps as reckless and cruel but did not call for or condone violence jd vance and thank god they’re willing to do it despite the fact that the local leadership of this community has made it harder on them and is in fact endangered their lives as they go about to do their important work reporter your reaction to the ninth circuit court of appeals their decision yesterday just want to get your reaction to that jd vance yeah well it’s interesting that for the past couple of weeks gavin newsom has said that there’s an illegitimate effort to send federal resources to secure a city that he refuses to secure and what the ninth circuit said yesterday is that that was a completely legitimate and proper use of federal law enforcement fact check the attached ninth circuit order 2537271pdf does not say the deployment was “completely legitimate and proper” instead the court allowed the deployment to continue while the appeal is pending finding that the president likely acted within his authority but reserving a final decision for later here’s what actually happened the ninth circuit granted a stay of a lower court order that had blocked the deployment of the california national guard by president trump the court found that the president likely acted within his statutory authority under 10 usc § 124063 which allows the president to federalize the national guard when regular forces are unable to execute the laws of the united states the court emphasized that its review was “highly deferential” to the president’s judgment in such matters the ninth circuit did not issue a final ruling on the merits of whether the deployment was lawful it only found that the federal government had made a “strong showing” that it would likely prevail on appeal and that the stay should be granted while the case proceeds the order also noted that the facts presented including significant violence and interference with federal officers provided a “colorable basis” for the president’s invocation of emergency authority jd vance the president has a very simple proposal to everybody in every city every community every town whether big or small if you enforce your own laws and if you protect federal law enforcement we’re not going to send in the national guard because it’s unnecessary but if you let violent rioters burn great american cities to the ground then of course we’re going to send federal law enforcement in to protect the people the president was elected to protect and i think what the ninth circuit said very clearly is when the president makes a determination that you’ve got to send in certain federal officials to protect people that determination was legitimate and the president is going to do it again if he has to but hopefully it won’t be necessary fact check trump has been interested in using the military during protests in the past during the nationwide protests following the killing of george floyd in 2020 trump was eager to deploy the military to suppress unrest according to senior national security advisors at the time trump was strongly in favor of using the military but was ultimately talked out of it due to concerns that it would be seen as martial law and an overreach of presidential authority trump later expressed regret about not deploying troops in 2020 stating in 2025 “i’ll never do that again if i see problems brewing i’m not going to wait two weeks” throughout his presidency and campaign events trump has repeatedly advocated a militarized response to civil unrest especially in cities governed by democrats he has characterized protesters as “paid insurrectionists” and “people who hate our country” and has positioned the military as a tool to restore order and deter dissent jd vance we don’t want to send these great marines to cities like los angeles we only do it if we have to to protect federal property and to protect the lives of our great law enforcement folks democratic groups who are releasing the addresses of ice agents in hotels around here well you know it just drives home i was actually shocked to hear this and i didn’t realize this until i was in the command center earlier talking to some of these great officials that often times you have far left agitators who are posting the names the addresses even the family members of some of our law enforcement in an effort to harass them antagonize them and even threaten their lives fact check there have been documented reports of ice and border patrol agents’ personal information being posted online—a practice known as “doxxing” federal agencies have acknowledged an increase in such incidents and officials have stated that this has led to harassment of agents and their families these actions are typically intended to intimidate or pressure law enforcement personnel involved in immigration enforcement jd vance and what do i take from that what i take from that is that you have a very small group of people who are so against the idea of border enforcement that they’re willing to threaten and endanger the lives of their fellow americans who are enforcing the law and something else i take from it is that gavin newsom and karen bass have got to stop this craziness every single law enforcement officer i talked to today every single one of them said they feel like the local leadership the mayor and the governor are encouraging these far left agitators what is the justification for this what is the reason for this there is a broad bipartisan consensus that we ought to have border enforcement and we ought to enforce our nation’s laws so why do you have far left agitators egged on by local officials who encouraging these agitators to harass and to threaten our border patrol you have it because of a lack of common sense these people need to be stopped these people need to be told that if you threaten a law enforcement officer you’re going to go to prison for it and that’s exactly what the trump administration that’s the message that we’re sending but look we could do so much better and we could have such an easier pathway for these federal law enforcement officers if the local leadership wasn’t egging this on and i think that’s the great tragedy what i see here today is the great tragedy when a mayor and a governor encourages their citizens to harass and endanger the lives of our police officers and our law enforcement officers it’s heartbreaking to see and thank god we’ve got great people who are willing to persevere despite it reporter another question mr vice president there’s been back and forth about whether uh raids will be going on in agricultural businesses and restaurants uh could you tell us if that’s going to continue or not vance well the president’s made two points on this that i think are very worth um emphasizing number one if you are in this country illegally you are at threat of deportation because that’s what it means to enforce the country’s laws if you’ve come here illegally the policy of the trump administration is that you shouldn’t be here fact check according to aaron reichlinmelnick of american immigration council ice’s own data approximately 836 of people detained by ice in fy 2025 were classified as “no ice threat level” while only 76 were classified as “high threat” cnn‘s examination of internal ice records found that more than 75 of people booked into ice custody in fiscal year 2025 had no criminal conviction other than immigration or trafficrelated offenses and less than 10 were convicted of serious crimes like murder assault robbery or rape similarly reuters reported that unpublished ice statistics show people with criminal convictions of any type made up only a small fraction of those detained with the number of people booked into immigration detention solely for immigration violations jumping eightfold since trump took office the guardian found an 807 increase in arrests of migrants with no criminal record from january to june 2025 while arrests of people with some past criminal charges or convictions rose only 91 immigration researcher austin kocher noted that nearly a third of all people held in ice detention now have no criminal history up from 6 in january jd vance you should go back and then come through proper channels if you so desire but the president has also said that he wants to focus our critical and and and short supply law enforcement resources on going after the really bad guys on the violent criminals on the rapists on the drug cartel members fact check immigrants who have gone through the proper channels whether with a visa or documented immigration have been detained by ice and deported immigrants are actually being taken while checking in with immigration authorities jd vance we’ve still got a lot of those people in our country and that’s where the president wants to focus law enforcement resources and that’s what he’ll continue to do reporter democrat lawmakers who keep getting handcuffed the new york times just did a story they keep getting handcuffed suggesting that they’re the trump administration is cracking down on democrats can you comment on that jd vance well i was hoping josé padilla would be here to ask a question uh but unfortunately i guess he decided not to show up because there wasn’t the theater and that’s all it is you know i think everybody realizes that’s what this is it’s pure political theater these guys show up they want to be captured on camera doing something fact check vance incorrectly referred to senator alex padilla who was forcibly removed from a news conference held by homeland security secretary kristi noem in los angeles padilla was handcuffed by officers as he attempted to speak out about the immigration raids that have sparked protests across california and the nation jd vance they want to be able to go back to their far left groups and to say ‘look me i stood up against border enforcement i stood up against donald trump’ but all they’re really standing up for is for drug cartels who are run rampant over our country and sex traffickers to be able to continue to traffic little kids into our country fact check while illinois democratic representatives were denied entry to a broadview immigration facility republican house speaker mike johnson was allowed to tour the chicago ice field office on the same day here is a list of members of congress who have recently been denied access to ice detention centers or facilities while attempting to conduct oversight based on the latest reporting california rep norma torres dpomona rep jimmy gomez dlos angeles rep judy chu dmonterey park sen alex padilla dcalifornia forcibly removed and handcuffed at a dhs news conference illinois rep delia ramirez dillinois rep jesús “chuy” garcía dillinois rep jonathan jackson dillinois rep danny davis dillinois rep raja krishnamoorthi dillinois new jersey rep lamonica mciver dnew jersey faced assault charges after an altercation with officers outside a detention center in newark new york rep jerry nadler dnew york rep dan goldman dnew york mississippi rep bennie thompson dmississippi ranking member house homeland security committee has publicly criticized the policy and reported being denied access jd vance that’s what you’re doing when you stand against border enforcement so i think these guys we ought to laugh ’em outta the building we ought to call them out for doing what they’re doing which is grandstanding and if they want to work seriously on border enforcement and on keeping their community safe the trump administration’s door is wide open but they’re not doing that they’d love the grandstanding they hate law enforcement because they hate the idea of the united states of america having a border it’s a disgrace but it is what it is we’ll do one more question reporteruh just another thing do you think that the admi — administration has been too aggressive with uh de — the deportation efforts like our noncriminals getting caught up in the dragnet as well vanceno look i don’t think that we’ve been too aggressive at all i mean first of all any time that a mistake has been made we correct that mistake very quickly but the unfortunate reality is that joe biden let in 15 to 20 million illegal aliens into this country and there is no way for us to actually get those unlawful illegal immigrants outta the united states of america without some serious law enforcement fact check us customs and border protection cbp recorded about 108 million border encounters nationwide from fy2021 through fy2024 with about 87 million at the southwest border however “encounters” do not equal admissions—many people are encountered more than once and a substantial portion are expelled or removed factcheckorg reports that of the millions of encounters about 25 million people have been released into the us during biden’s presidency while 28 million have been removed or expelled there are also estimates of 16 to 2 million “gotaways” people who entered without being apprehended the federation for american immigration reform fair a group that advocates for lower immigration estimates that as of march 2025 there are about 186 million illegal immigrants living in the us up from their estimate of 168 million in june 20234 however this number includes people who may have been in the us for many years not just those who arrived under biden and fair’s methodology is broader than most other estimates other researchers including cato institute immigration analyst david bier estimate that the net increase in the unauthorized immigrant population under biden is about 55 to 6 million jd vance and that’s what we’ve been trying to do it’s not too aggressive it’s not you know not aggressive enough it’s just the right approach to make sure that we’re enforcing our country’s border laws we have to remember 100000 americans die of fentanyl overdoses brought in by the mexican drug cartels we’ve got a terrible sex and human trafficking problem because of what these cartels are doing at the southern border fact check in 2022 fentanyl was responsible for 73654 deaths in the us which was more than double the number of deaths from 2019 fentanyl was involved in over half of all drug overdose deaths since 2019 and by 2022 it was the underlying cause of nearly 70 of drug overdose deaths in the second half of 2023 opioid overdose deaths including those from fentanyl started to decline by december 2023 opioid deaths were 20 fewer than in december 2022 overdose deaths involving opioids decreased from an estimated 84181 in 2022 to 81083 in 2023 the most recent data shows a substantial decline in overdose deaths between july 2023 and july 2024 drug overdose deaths in the united states fell by 17 this 17 decrease is the largest ever seen in the united states from 20132017 fentanyl seizures were low in 2018 cbp seized 745 kilograms of fentanyl by 2019 seizures jumped to 1208 kilograms representing a 62 increase from the previous year by midyear 2020 cbp had already seized 1208 kilograms of fentanyl matching the total for all of 2019 in 2023 dea seized nationally more than 77 million fentanyl pills and nearly 12000 pounds of fentanyl powder which amounts to more than 386 million deadly doses of fentanyl prevented from reaching consumers about 21148 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the mexican border in fiscal year 2024 accounting for roughly 966 of the total the amount seized at the southern border in fy 2024 was down from 26718 pounds in fy 2023 there was a significant increase in fentanyl seizures under the biden administration in the first five months of fy 2024 alone over 13000 pounds of illicit fentanyl were seized by us customs and border protection cbp and homeland security investigations hsi cbp has seized more fentanyl in the last two fiscal years than in the previous five fiscal years combined jd vance the president deserves great credit because after 45 days you saw illegal border crossings draw to a small fraction illegal border crossings down over 99 under president trump’s leadership but unfortunately because joe biden was president for four years we’ve got a lot of bad people in the united states of america that we’ve gotta do the job of getting out of our country fact check the claim of “over 99” is accurate only for certain corridors or “gotaway” statistics not for the overall total of border encounters which is down 93 jd vance that’s what these guys are doing we ought to support them and we ought to have local leadership that empowers them to do their job of making americans safer instead gavin newsom and karen bass they’ve decided to go to war against the people trying to keep our community safe that’s a disgrace that’s a terrible commentary on their qualities as leaders but the trump administration is gonna keep on standing for the american citizens and for american law enforcement thank you all great to be here and thank you to you guys leave a comment cancelyour email address will not be published required fields are marked message name email
