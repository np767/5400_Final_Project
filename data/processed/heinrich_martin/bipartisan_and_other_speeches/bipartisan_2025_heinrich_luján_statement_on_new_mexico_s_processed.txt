they are actively choosing to harm working families. “to date, republicans in the state legislature have not called on president trump and congressional republicans to comply with court orders to fund snap, have not called on them to work with democrats to reopen the government and address skyrocketing health care costs, and have not condemned their party’s decision to block our legislation to keep families fed and pay service members and federal employees. their silence speaks volumes, and their complicity in trump’s government shutdown is infuriating. “it’s time trump and republicans get serious, come to the table, and work with democrats to pass a deal that lowers health care costs, reopens the government, and ensures families in new mexico don’t go hungry because of republicans’ failure to lead. we will keep fighting to lower costs for every hardworking person in new mexico and ensure families can put food on the table.” republicans control the white house, the u.s. house of representatives, and the u.s. senate. most recently, trump and republicans passed into law massive cuts to snap in their big, bad bill, which gutted $187 billion from snap nationally and could cut new mexico’s snap funding by 43.9% by 2029. in response to republicans’ big, bad bill, democrats in the new mexico legislature approved supplemental snap funding to begin to bridge the gap in snap benefits for new mexicans.they also had the foresight to appropriate additional emergency contingency funds, which the governor is now usingto temporarily cover the gap in benefits for the first 10 days of november due to trump’s government shutdown. new mexico needs approximately $81,000,000 a month to fully fund snap. despite having the funds available to pay for snap during trump’s government shutdown, the trump administration continues to play politics with new mexico’s working families. the usda has the authority to release snap contingency funds, and the trump administration is required by law to release these funds. yet, trump is choosing not to fund snap during republicans’ shutdown — despite a court order demanding his administration do so. new mexico needs approximately $81,000,000 a month to fully fund snap. last month, heinrich and luján demanded that the usda secretary immediately release billions of dollars in available funds to ensure supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap) benefits continue in november. ### previous article next article website-search
