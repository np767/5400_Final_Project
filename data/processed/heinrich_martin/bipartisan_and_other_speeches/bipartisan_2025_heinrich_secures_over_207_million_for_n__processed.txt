fighting to secure funding for critical investments in new mexico, and they are now signed into law. from housing and nutrition programs that support working families, to resources for our veterans and investments in military infrastructure that strengthen our national security — these investments reflect our values. i will always fight for federal resources that grow our economy, lower costs, put new mexico families first, and honor the service of those who keep us safe,” said heinrich, a member of the u.s. senate appropriations committee. heinrich continued, “still, it’s no secret that i was extremely frustrated with the process that led to passage of these appropriations bills. that includes the senate majority leader airdropping a provision at the eleventh hour that could award senators hundreds of thousands of dollars for having their phone records lawfully collected as part of legitimate criminal investigations. and i will continue working to fix this, because i will never allow anyone to fleece their pockets at the expense of hardworking new mexicans. i will also continue fighting to rein in skyrocketing health care costs that families simply cannot afford to pay. we need to extend the aca tax credits, and we need to do it now.” fy26 military construction, veterans affairs key points and highlights congressionally directed spending heinrich successfully included

are enrolled in the veterans health administration (vha). many rural veterans enrolled in the va health care system are at an advanced age, with approximately 54 percent aged 65 or older. with the aging veteran population growing increasingly medically complex and more likely to be diagnosed with chronic conditions like diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease, each requiring more frequent, ongoing, and costly care, these funds will help close the gap and get highly rural veterans the care they need. telehealth services heinrich successfully secured $6.4 billion to sustain and increase telehealth capacity and expand the reach of va medical providers to veterans in highly rural areas through the use of in-home telehealth and remote patient monitoring services. the bill

childcare assistance heinrich successfully secured an additional $3,000,000 in the va’s overall budget to support the expansion of childcare centers at va medical facilities through a pilot program. while serving in the u.s. house of representatives, heinrich voted in favor of the caregivers and veterans omnibus health services act of 2010 (p.l. 111-163). this bill led to the va’s initial childcare pilot program to assess feasibility and advisability of providing childcare services to veterans receiving mental health and intensive health care services. construction of state extended care facilities heinrich successfully secured $275 million in construction funds for state extended care facilities. in new mexico, there is only one va long-term care facility, despite demand for additional capacity and facilities. these facilities are particularly important to ensure aging and disabled veterans receive the appropriate level of care. medical and prosthetics research heinrich

bipartisan ensuring the necessary destruction of (end) illicit chinese tobacco act (s.3148). these provisions grant the fda explicit authority to destroy adulterated, misbranded, or counterfeit tobacco products, such as illicit e-cigarettes from the people’s republic of china, upon import. congress has historically granted the fda authority to destroy certain illicit drugs and medical devices, and now heinrich’s bipartisan legislation extends this authority to unauthorized tobacco products, thereby protecting public health and national security. southwest border commission heinrich secured a $2.5 million investment in the southwest border commission (sbrc), a $500,000 increase over fy25, which supports economic and community development in southern new mexico. heinrich

authorities. tribal communities the bill provides $235 million for the food distribution on indian reservation program (fdpir) and $3 million for a fdpir pilot program that allows tribes participating in the program to purchase traditional food from small tribal producers. the bill also provides $700,000 for processing and federal inspection of tribal bison, which will help support tribal food sovereignty by enabling tribes to include bison raised on their own lands to be included in federal nutrition programs like school meals. additionally, the bill provides $5.1 million for the u.s. department of agriculture’s (usda) office of tribal relations, which is responsible for government-to-government relations between usda and tribal governments. rural rental assistance the bill provides $1.715 billion for rental assistance to help ensure americans living in rural areas have access to safe and affordable housing. the bill also includes $1 billion in single family direct loans to help more low-income families and first-time home buyers get mortgages. animal and plant health inspection service (aphis) the bill provides $1.2 billion for aphis, to help protect more than $325

and avian influenza. the bill includes $22.5 million for chronic wasting diseases-related activities, including direct support to states and tribes for their management activities, surveillance, and testing. conservation heinrich successfully fought to require usda to notify and seek approval from the senate and house appropriations committee before it closes natural resources conservation service (nrcs) or rural development field offices or permanently relocates any field-based employees of those agencies that would result in an office with 2 or fewer employees. the bill rejects the administration’s senseless proposal to eliminate all discretionary funding for conservation technical assistance (cta), which is the bedrock of nrcs's mission and a vital tool for farmers and ranchers. instead, the bill provides $850 million for nrcs’s conservation operations, which includes $700 million for cta and $10 million for the grazing lands conservation initiative. agriculture research this bill provides $1.8 billion for the agricultural research service (ars). this includes funding for the long-term agroecosystems research (ltar) network, which includes a research site that is a collaboration between the new mexico state university (nmsu) and the ars experimental station in las cruces. the bill also includes $500,000 in funding for important research in agrivoltaics, like the research being conducted by ars in collaboration with nmsu. small farms and local food systems the bill includes $5 million for the office of urban agriculture, which is focused on providing technical assistance and risk management tools to urban and innovative forms of food production in new mexico. albuquerque is home to one of the usda’s urban service centers. the bill also includes $16.3 million for the local agriculture market program (lamp), which supports the development, coordination, and expansion of direct producer-to-consumer marketing; local and regional food markets and enterprises; and value-added agricultural products. fy26 legislative branch key points and highlights as ranking member of the legislative branch appropriations subcommittee, heinrich successfully negotiated and secured passage of the fy26 legislative branch appropriations bill, which provides $7,258,000,000 to support essential legislative operations and oversight activities, including the u.s. senate, capitol police, library of congress, congressional research service, congressional budget office, architect of the capitol, and other key legislative agencies. at a time when maintaining checks and balances is more important than ever, this bill includes critical provisions that ensure congress can effectively serve the american people and hold the executive branch accountable. safety and security heinrich secured $852 million to support security operations for members, staff, and visitors to the capitol campus. this funding level allows continued recruitment and retention of sworn and civilian personnel. the bill also provides $30 million for the continuation of mutual aid reimbursements for state and local law enforcement, which helps cover costs incurred by state and local police departments when protecting lawmakers and congressionally sponsored events. and the bill responds to increasing safety threats by providing $203.5 million for enhanced member security for both the senate and the house. government accountability office (gao) heinrich secured flat funding for the gao, which is crucial for protecting taxpayer dollars, promoting government efficiency, and providing rigorous, nonpartisan oversight that builds public trust, at the fy25 level. this prevents a cut to gao by 50% as proposed by the house of representatives majority. the enacted funding level protects the agency’s ability to perform core functions in supporting congress and rejects house republicans’ efforts to cut gao by over $400 million dollars, which would have resulted in the elimination of nearly 2,200 positions and gutting gao’s ability to carry out their mandatory mission. heinrich successfully blocked a house republican rider that would have prohibited gao from using appropriated funds to take civil action against the administration for violations of the impoundment control act congressional budget office (cbo) heinrich secured nearly $5 million above the fy25 enacted level for cbo. this includes an additional $2.75 million to address cybersecurity upgrades necessary in response to recent cyber intrusions against the agency. library of congress heinrich secured $852 million for the library in fy26, including $17.5 million for programs including teaching with primary sources, the surplus books program, veteran history project, and the lewis houghton civics and democracy initiative. this is a rejection of house republicans’ efforts to slash programs they viewed as diversity, equity, and inclusion (dei) initiatives. workplace protections heinrich successfully extended pump act protections to congressional staff, safeguarding the rights of nursing mothers in the workplace. the providing urgent maternal protections for nursing mothers (pump) act was passed in 2022. it strengthened workplace protections for nursing mothers but excepted the legislative branch from having to provide reasonable break time and a private space for nursing mothers’ use. now, this exemption is removed and the pump act protections apply to legislative branch employees. additionally, heinrich blocked a house republican rider that would have enabled workplace discrimination against those in same-sex marriages. heinrich also condemned a provision that was inserted in the bill at the last minute by republican majority leader john thune (r-s.d.), which will let senators collect millions of dollars to enrich themselves because their phone records were lawfully obtained during a biden-era investigation. heinrich released the following statement condemning the provision: “i am furious that the senate minority and majority leaders chose to airdrop this provision into this bill at the eleventh hour — with zero consultation or negotiation with the subcommittee that actually oversees this work. this is precisely what’s wrong with the senate,” said heinrich, ranking member of the legislative branch appropriations subcommittee. ### previous article next article website-search
