"our bill is about accountability, transparency, and fighting for working families. the senate must take this bill up and pass it now.” “while we were fighting to lower health care costs and keep food on the table for hardworking americans, senate republicans were slipping a taxpayer-funded payout for themselves into the government funding bill,” said kelly. “it’s a political cash grab — plain and simple, and our bill puts an end to it. republicans and democrats should be able to agree that ripping off american taxpayers is bad policy.” the anti-cash grab act is led by u.s. senators martin heinrich (d-n.m.) and mark kelly (d-ariz.). the legislation is cosponsored by u.s. senators angela alsobrooks (d-md.), tammy baldwin (d-wis.), michael bennet (d-colo.), cory booker (d-n.j.), richard blumenthal (d-conn.), chris coons (d-del.), catherine cortez masto (d-nev.), tammy duckworth (d-ill.), dick durbin (d-ill.), kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.), tim kaine (d-va.), angus king (i-maine), amy klobuchar (d-minn.), ben ray luján (d-n.m.), ed markey (d-mass.), jeff merkley (d-ore.), patty murray (d-wash.), alex padilla (d-calif.), gary peters (d-mich.), jack reed (d-r.i.), brain schatz (d-hawaii), jeanne shaheen (d-n.h.), chris van hollen (d-md.), peter welch (d-vt.), sheldon whitehouse (d-r.i.), and ron wyden (d-ore.). a one-page summary of the bill is here . the full text of the bill is here . ### previous article next article website-search
