san diego, ca – today, rep. peters released the following statement as the government shutdown stretches to day 36 and becomes the longest in our nation’s history: “the consequences of this shutdown for americans are only growing more dire. tens of thousands of san diegans have missed a paycheck. nearly 400,000 don’t have enough food to eat as snap benefits hang in the balance. without the extension of critical tax credits under the affordable care act, 28,000 ca50 residents will see their healthcare costs skyrocket. “during previous shutdowns, members of congress were required to stay in washington to vote as negotiations went on, which meant we were talking constantly about how to end the shutdown. this time, speaker johnson cancelled votes indefinitely and sent us all home, so there are no discussions happening. republicans control the house, senate, and white house. we need leader thune and speaker johnson to act as the independently elected leaders of a co-equal branch of government that they are, rather than waiting for president trump to give them permission to negotiate with democrats. “i introduced the no budget no pay act to prevent congress from getting paid unless it does its job and passes a budget on time. putting our paychecks on the line alongside servicemembers and federal workers and requiring members of congress to stay in washington during a shutdown, would light a fire under congress to end the gridlock. “also, during the shutdown, i donate my weekly take-home pay to local nonprofits working to support san diegans who are suffering because of the shutdown. i have donated to support the enlisted project (step), the san diego food bank and feeding san diego, interfaith community services, and serving seniors. “i will continue doing everything i can to support san diegans and re-open the government as soon as possible. find a detailed faq on what a shutdown means for essential services and san diego families here .” ###
