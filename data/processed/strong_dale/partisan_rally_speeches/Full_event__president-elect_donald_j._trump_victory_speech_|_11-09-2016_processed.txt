together as one united people. it is time. i pledge to every citizen of our land that i will be president for all americans. and this is so important to me. for those who have chosen not to support me in the past of which there were a few people, i am reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. as i have said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard work in men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. it is a movement comprised of americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. looking together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the american dream. i have spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. that is now what i want to do for our country. i have got to know our country so well, tremendous potential. it is going to be a beautiful thing. every single american will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. we are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. we are going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. we will also finally take care of our great veterans. we have been so loyal and i have got to know so many over this 18-month journey. the time i have spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. veterans are incredible people. we will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. i will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. it is going to happen. we have a great economic plan. we will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. at the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. it will be. i have great relationships. we expect to have great, great relationships. no dream is too big. no challenge is too great. nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. america will no longer settle for anything less than the best. we must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. we have to do that. we are going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. i want to tell the world community that while we will always put america's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. all people and all other nations. we will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. and now

there. i know it. rights is a superstar. but i said, they cannot call you a superstar, rights unless we win. because you cannot be called a superstar, like secretary. if secretary came in second,

the success and what we have done. so i also have to say i have gotten into some incredible people, the secret service people. they are tough, and they are smart, and they are sharp. and i do not want to mess around with them. i can tell you. and when i want to go and wave to a big group of people, and they rip me down and put me back down to the seat, but they are fantastic people. so i want to thank the secret service. and law enforcement in new york city, they are here tonight. these are spectacular people sometimes underappreciated, unfortunately, but we appreciate them. we know what they go through. so it is been what they call a historic event. but to be really historic, we have to do a great job. and i promise you that i will not let you down. we will do a great job. we will do a great job. i look very much forward to being your president. and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years, you will say so many of you work so hard for us. but you will say that you will say that that was something that you were really were very proud to do. and i can thank you very much. and i can only say that while the campaign is over, our work
