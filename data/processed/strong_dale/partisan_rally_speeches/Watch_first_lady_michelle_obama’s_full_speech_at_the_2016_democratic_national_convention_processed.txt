oh thank you all thank you so much you know it is it is hard to believe that it has been eight years since i first came to this convention to talk with you about why i thought my husband should be president remember how i told you about his character and conviction his decency and his grace the traits that we have seen every day that he served our country in the white house i also told you about our daughters how they are the heart of our hearts the center of our world and during our time in the white house we have had the joy of washing them grow from bubbly little girls into poised young women a journey that started soon after we arrived in washington when they set off for their first day at their new school i will never forget that when or morning as i watched our girls just seven and ten years old pilates of those black suvs with all those big men with guns and i saw their little faces pressed up against the window and the only thing i could think was what have we done? see because at that moment i realized that our time in the white house would form the foundation for who they would become and how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them that is what barack and i think about every day as we try to guide and protect our girls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight how we urge them to ignore those who question their father's citizenship or fake how we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on tv does not represent the true spirit of this country how we explain that when someone is cruel or acts like a bully you do not stoop to their level no, our motto is when they go low we go high with with every word we utter with every action we take we know our kids are watching us we as parents are their most important role models and let me tell you barack and i take that same approach to our jobs as president and first lady because we know that our words and actions matter not just to our girls, but the children across this country kids kids who tell us i saw you on tv i wrote a report on you for school kids like the little black boy who looked up at my husband his eyes wide with hope and he wondered is my hair like yours and make no mistake about it this november when we go to the polls that is what we are deciding not democrat or republican not left or right no in this election and every election is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives and i i am here tonight because in this election there is only one person who i trust with that responsibility only one person who i believe is truly qualified to be president of the united states and that is our friend hillary clinton that is right see i trust i trust hillary to lead this country because i have seen her lifelong devotion to our nation's children not just her own daughter who she has raised to perfection but but every child who needs a champion kids who take the long way to school to avoid the gangs kids who wonder how they will ever afford college kids whose parents do not speak a word of english but dream of a better life kids who look to us to determine who and what they can be you see hillary has spent decades doing the relentless thankless work to actually make a difference in their lives advocating for kids with disabilities as a young lawyer fighting for children's health care at first lady and for quality child care in the senate and when she did not win the nomination eight years ago she did not get angry or disillusioned she hillary did not hillary did not pack up and go home because as a true public servant hillary knows that this is so much bigger than her own desires and disappointment so so she proudly stepped up to serve our country once again as secretary of state traveling the globe to keep our kids safe and look there were plenty of moments when hillary could have decided that this work was too hard that the price of public service was too high that she was tired of being picked apart for how she looks or how she talks or even how she laughs but here's the thing what i admire most about hillary is that she never buckles under pressure she she never takes the easy way out and hillary clinton has never quit on anything in her life and when i think about the kind of president that i want for my girls and all our children that is what i want i want someone with the proven strength to persevere someone who knows this job and takes it seriously someone who understands that the issues of president faces are not black and white and cannot be boiled down to 140 characters look because because when when you have the nuclear codes at your fingertips and the military in your command you cannot make snap decisions you cannot have a thin skin or a tendency to lash out you need to be steady and measured and well informed i want a president with a record of public service someone whose life's work shows our children that we do not chase fame and fortune for ourselves we fight to give everyone a chance to succeed and and we give back even when we are struggling ourselves because we know that there is always some work one more soft and there but for the grace of god go i i want a president who will teach our children that everyone in this country matters a president who truly believes in the vision that our founders put forth all those years ago that we are all created equal each a beloved part of the great american story and when crisis hits we do not turn against each other now. we we listen to each other we lean on each other because we are always stronger together and i am here tonight because i know that that is the kind of president that hillary clinton will be and that is why in this election i am with her you see hillary understands that the president is about one thing and one thing only it is about leaving something better for our kids that is how we have always moved this country forward by all of us coming together on behalf of our children folks who volunteered to coach that team to teach that sunday school class because they know it takes a village heroes of every color and creed who wear the uniform and risk their lives to keep passing down those blessings of liberty police officers and the protesters in dallas who all desperately want to keep our children safe people who lined up in orlando to donate blood because they could have been their son their daughter in that club leaders like tim cain who show who show our kids what decency and devotion look like leaders like hillary clinton who has the guts and the grace to keep coming back and putting those cracks in that highest and hardest black ceiling and so she finally breaks through lifting all of us along with her that is is the story of this country the story that has brought me to the stage tonight the story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage the shame of servitude the sting of segregation but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today i wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves and and i have watched my daughters two beautiful intelligent black young women playing with their dogs on the white house lawn and and because of hillary clinton my daughters and all our sons and daughters now take for granted that a woman can be president of the united states so look so do not let anyone ever tell you that this country is not great that somehow we need to make it great again because this right now is the greatest country on earth and and as my my daughters prepared to set out into the world i want to leader who is worthy of that truth a leader who is worthy of my girls promise and all our kids promise a leader who will be guided every day by the love and hope and impossibly big dreams that we all have for our children so in this election we cannot sit back and hope that everything works out for the best we cannot afford to be tired or frustrated or cynical no hear me between now and november we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago we need to knock on every door we need to get out every vote we need to pour every last ounce of our passion and our strength and our love for this country into electing hillary clinton as president of the united states of america so let us get to work thank you all we got blessed
