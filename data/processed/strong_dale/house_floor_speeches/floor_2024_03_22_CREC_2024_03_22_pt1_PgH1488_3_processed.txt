[congressional record volume 170, number 51 (friday, march 22, 2024)] [house] [page h1488] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1200 celebrating montana ag week (mr. rosendale asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. rosendale. mr. speaker, i rise today in recognition and celebration of both national and montana ag weeks. food security is national security, and across the treasure state and the country, farmers work tirelessly to keep food supplies safe and plentiful so we do not have to rely on foreign nations to sustain our population. agriculture is not just an industry in montana. it is our way of life. it contributes an average of $5.2 billion a year to the economy. producers' hard work, dedication, and resilience play an essential role in feeding our communities, sustaining our economy, and managing our land. while ag production is a vital industry, it does not come without its challenges. congress must first secure a strong crop insurance program that gives producers certainty and, secondly, pass my land and national defense act, which would prohibit the chinese communist party from buying farmland in our country. both initiatives can be included in this year's farm bill to show producers that folks here in washington have not forgotten about them and have their backs in times of need. ag producers deserve recognition for the work they do to take care of our great nation. ____________________
