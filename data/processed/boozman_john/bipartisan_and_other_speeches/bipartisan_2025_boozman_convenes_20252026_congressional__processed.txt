congressional youth cabinet participants in little rock. little rock, ark.— u.s. senator john boozman (r-ar) recently launched the ninth year of his congressional youth cabinet at the old state house museum in little rock. this year, 80 accomplished participants were selected from public, private, charter and homeschools across the natural state for their demonstrated community leadership and involvement, representing some of arkansas’s best and brightest students. “i was pleased to welcome the next generation of our state’s leaders to this year’s congressional youth cabinet where they will explore legislative solutions to issues that interest them and meet peers who share their enthusiasm for civic engagement and the democratic process,” said boozman . “their excitement for this initiative is encouraging and i know they will collaborate eagerly while working to identify their policy priorities, conduct impressive research and present their findings and ideas later this school year.” boozman and his office designed the congressional youth cabinet as a nonpartisan, civics-based program to offer students a first-hand experience with the democratic process and the opportunity to understand how public policy impacts them, their families and their communities. the students will attend meetings throughout the school year and work in teams to select and then research national issues that they will present policy recommendations on to the senator and his staff the following spring. click here for more photos and videos from the cyc kick-off. the following students were
