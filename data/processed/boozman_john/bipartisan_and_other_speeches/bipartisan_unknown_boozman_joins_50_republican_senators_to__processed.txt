washington— u.s. senator john boozman (r-ar) joined senator lindsey graham (r-sc) and 49 of their republican colleagues, in sending a letter to u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) secretary robert f. kennedy jr. and u.s. food and drug administration (fda) commissioner dr. martin makary urging the agencies to reevaluate the recent approval of generic mifepristone, a drug used to perform chemical abortions that are deadly to unborn children. further, mifepristone has known serious health risk for expecting mothers and unrestricted access to abortion drugs systematically undermines states’ rights by violating pro-life state laws. “we are deeply concerned about the fda’s approval of a new generic version of mifepristone,” the senators wrote . “while we recognize the fda’s statutory responsibility in evaluating drug applications, the timing of this approval appears inconsistent with the comprehensive safety reassessment your agencies have prioritized. out of respect for this important review, and with full confidence in your dedication to protecting women’s health, states’ rights, and unborn life, we urge you to take decisive action to reevaluate whether this generic version of mifepristone is suitable to enter the market.” the letter was signed by senate majority leader john thune (r-sd) and senators jim banks (r-in), john barrasso (r-wy), marsha blackburn (r-tn), katie britt (r-al), ted budd (r-nc), shelley moore capito (r-wv), bill cassidy, m.d.

commit to ensuring that all generic versions of mifepristone are included in the ongoing reevaluation of prior rems approvals; reinstate the in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone and all its generic versions; suspend the distribution of mifepristone and all generic versions as an “imminent hazard” under section 505(e) of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (fdca); and withdraw fda guidance permitting pharmacy distribution of mifepristone and all its generic versions. we are committed to continuing to work together to give a voice to the voiceless and protect women from the dangerous effects of unregulated access to chemical abortion drugs. the life, safety, freedom, and health of millions of americans, born and unborn, depend on it.
