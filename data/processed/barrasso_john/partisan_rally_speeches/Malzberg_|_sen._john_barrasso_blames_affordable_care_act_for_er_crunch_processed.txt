all right ladies and gentlemen welcome back joining us now is senator john barrasso, republican of the great state of wyoming former orthopedic surgeon for 24 years at chairman of the senate republican policy committee. senator i welcome you i know that this is obviously something very close to your heart and it is close to all our hearts and we have not talked about it because of everything that is going on in the world and in this country and the elections and you name it and that is obamacare and i was not surprised but i mean it blared out at me when i saw this this headline that us emergency room visits keep going up despite obamacare and one of the selling points of obamacare was we cannot have keep having people go to the emergency room for their medical treatment so what is going on? well you are absolutely right a survey of over 2,000 emergency room doctors people who know because they are working in the emergency room say that the volume has gone up in many places significantly in the emergency room and part of it is that so many of the people that are on the obamacare plan have been put there on medicaid a program that we know does not work many doctors do not take it at all because the pays so little even doctors that the health and human services say do take patients it is about a month to get an appointment so the ers are getting swamped which is the exact opposite of what the president promised the american people and that the impact then on an emergency room if you have a real emergency is that the time to see a doctor it goes up as does the more the more ability because people end up having to wait too long for treatment of a serious issue like a stroke or a heart attack right and and this is the result and correct me if i am wrong of people who as you said on the floor of the senate have been pushed on to medicaid because of obamacare and they cannot find doctors who are taken medicaid so they have to go to the emergency room for primary care well you know the president made sure we had a lot of irs agents hired under the health care law to look at your taxes but not doctors or nurses to actually treat your medical problems so you know as i have said from the beginning coverage does not equal care and the president has always said i am gonna get more people covered the headline is more people covered but that does not mean they can actually get care and it is become a lot worse problem for emergency rooms and as you and i have talked in the past emergency rooms are where the care is the most expensive yeah yeah you ever get a bill from a from god forbid you have to go to an emergency room you get hit in the head or a cut or or or get chest pains it is outraged by the way i do not know if i said medicare medicaid but i meant medicaid so let us let us talk about a solution you know i you and i have discussed this also republican plan to combat this i keep hearing more and more that that there is no way now that the republicans could could i mean look the budget you for the first time in six years you guys got a budget you are not defunding obamacare so what how how you gonna fix this well you know that we cannot fix obamacare but we can fix healthcare working to give the patients like the care they need from a doctor they choose at lower cost and like washington made this mess washington cannot solve it i want to get the decisions being made at the state level where states can decide what kind of insurance people need or and people can decide for themselves i want to get rid of this individual mandate that makes people buy all this expensive insurance you know the president calls these things the essential benefits to me they are excessive benefits that a lot of people are ending up paying for so we need to get this decisions made much more closely to home and i think that is one of the things will help drive down the cost of all of this care but you are right the the health care law did not fund enough training for enough of the health care providers to take care of people we have a shortage of nurses doctors all different levels of people taking care of patients and that is one of the real challenges that we face as a society where people are living much longer yeah lives and and in many cases healthier lives and the president's health care law i think made it much worse from a budget standpoint because the costs are so large all right we got about a minute left let us talk about the the iran bill on the senate floor what is the what is gonna happen with that well we are going to put a bipartisan sanctions bill on the president's desk so the president has to come to congress the congress of the elected representatives the united states before he goes to the security council of the united can you get that with just like 30 some odd votes in the senate is not it well yeah we are gonna get a chance to see the deal when it is cut and then we will make our case to the american people why we think it is a bad deal with it can only be a good deal if it is enforceable if it is verifiable if it is accountable if the inspections are anytime anywhere instead of making appointment for next tuesday because we all know and this is republicans and democrats know that iran with a nuclear weapon makes the world less safe less secure and less stable no absolutely all right senator is always thanks for joining us sir thanks for having my pleasure take care yeah folks we cannot lose sight of obamacare and the disaster that it is and that it is been and that it will continue to be and and when emergency room everything this president promised about his bill has not come true it is all been lies misinformation disinformation and or a total failure from premiums and costs and to keep your doctor keep your insurance if you like it to emergency room visits going down it is all been a failure give me five is next you you
