members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on h.r. 7309, the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from virginia? there was no objection. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, the workforce innovation and opportunity act, or wioa, is the backbone of our nation's workforce development system. each year, wioa programs help working people across the country get the skills they need to find better-paying careers and help employers access a dedicated and skilled workforce. unfortunately, our investment in workforce development has fallen significantly over time. while the u.s. labor force has grown approximately 50 percent over the last four decades, federal investment in workforce development has fallen by two-thirds when adjusted for inflation. federal investment in workforce development has fallen by two-thirds. this underinvestment hurts workers, it hurts businesses, and it hurts our economy's competitive edge. other developed countries spend between one-half of 1 percent to 1 full percent of their gross domestic product on workforce development. we spend only one-tenth of 1 percent. the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022 addresses this chronic underinvestment so that we can finally meet the needs of workers and businesses, fill job openings with qualified workers, reduce supply chain shortages, and lower costs for families. by investing approximately $80 billion over the next 6 years, this legislation would more than double the number of people receiving training services in fiscal year 2023 and allow us to train 1 million workers per year by 2028. the legislation modernizes wioa to help expand work opportunities for disconnected youth. it makes critical reforms to improve job corps, and it expands sector-based training so that we can train for entire sectors such as electric cars, trucking, and nurses. it strengthens community colleges' capacity to help workers succeed in in-demand industries. it helps justice-involved individuals re-enter the labor force and obtain sustainable career paths. madam speaker, if we want to keep our global competitive edge, if we want to lower costs, and if we want to accelerate our economic recovery, then we must pass the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022. this legislation is the product of a largely bipartisan, year-long effort, including a bipartisan roundtable and three bipartisan hearings in our committee. while many of my counterparts across the aisle have voiced opposition to the size of the investments in the bill, i remain hopeful that all of my colleagues will join me in voting to stand with america's workers. madam speaker, i thank the chair of the higher education and workforce investment subcommittee, ms. wilson, for her work on this critical priority, and i urge support of the legislation. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, republicans are committed to preparing america's workforce for the 21st century. this reauthorization of the workforce innovation and opportunity act, wioa, will not help our country live up to its potential. in fact, this reauthorization moves our workplace development system in the wrong direction. our labor market is not facing a lack of job openings or a lack of workers. currently there are 11.3 million open jobs, but unfortunately there are too few americans with the skills needed to fill them effectively. that is why we need a robust workforce development system that will prepare workers for in-demand skills. during the education and labor committee markup of h.r. 7309, republicans offered an amendment that would empower employers to respond to local economic needs; streamline the workforce development system by increasing local collaboration and putting program qualification decisions at the state and local level; strengthen outcomes and accountability by adding evidence-based practices, maintaining common performance-based metrics, funding programs with a track record of success, and improving transparency measures; and reduce bureaucracy by requiring the department of labor to address regulatory bottlenecks. {time} 1430 democrats blocked all those commonsense proposals. republicans also pushed to allocate more funds for upskilling workers and support robust postsecondary education programs that focus on in- demand skills. instead of embracing innovative models, democrats rely on an 85-year-old federal apprenticeship model from the great depression. this model has not been working and throwing more money at it will not change that. our nation's job creators are in a far better position to help run workforce development programs, but this bill puts washington in the driver's seat. instead of putting workers first, this legislation makes bureaucrats and labor unions the priority. for example, provisions in this bill increase the size of state and local governing boards and dilute employer input to increase the power of labor unions. too often, labor unions have the interests of their union bosses in mind instead of the interests of workers. giving big labor an outsized role on these boards will render these programs less responsive to industry needs. h.r. 7309 also promotes progressive gender ideology and critical race theory by requiring states to develop and publish state equity reports regarding performance outcomes on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity. leave it to the left to destroy equality in pursuit of equity, a word one author aptly described as ``dispensing unequal treatment in order to achieve equal outcomes.'' taking the focus of our job programs off upskilling workers and putting it onto a woke agenda will do a disservice to all our jobseekers. this legislation also increases cumbersome administrative hurdles for employers. if we want employers to participate in these programs, we need a system that has fewer barriers and is easier to navigate. this process should be streamlined instead of making it more complex. instead of making this program more efficient, provisions in this reauthorization will end up costing taxpayers more. h.r. 7309 will require job corps contractors to comply with onerous local prevailing wage requirements. this will significantly increase the cost of all job corps projects without improving the program's effectiveness. on top of that, the bill weakens expectations for job corps' success. job corps is a program that has been fraught with negative issues for decades. this is a program in which 30 different government reports and audits have raised concerns over its safety and security. people have literally been killed in this program, and the left wants to make it less accountable. other provisions in the bill water down performance metrics, reducing the ability of congress to measure the success of workforce development programs. more accountability and measurable outcomes are clearly necessary. according to a 2018 investigation by the tampa bay times, some local workforce boards had significantly misreported their outcomes and took credit for finding thousands of jobs for people who never even participated in the program. other data demonstrate that these programs are not always effective, even when being operated honestly. less than one-quarter of young enrollees and barely one-third of adults exited programs with occupations related to the workforce development program in which they were enrolled. clearly, something is not working. let me repeat: fewer than 25 percent of young enrollees and only 30 percent of adults came out of the programs into jobs related to the workforce development program in which they were enrolled. if we hope to enhance our nation's economic competitiveness and upskill workers for in-demand jobs, we must create a workforce development system that actually works. this bill utterly fails to do that. the american people deserve so much better. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from oregon (ms. bonamici), the chair of the subcommittee on civil rights and human services. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i thank chairman scott for yielding and for his leadership. madam speaker, i rise in strong support of the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022. this important legislation improves the existing statute in several critical ways. first, this legislation formally authorizes sector partnerships. i have witnessed the significant benefit of sector partnerships. one persuasive example in northwest oregon is the oregon manufacturing innovation center, omic, which develops and applies advanced metals manufacturing technologies in their r&d center, while educating an advanced manufacturing workforce in their training center run by portland community college. omic is an outstanding example of how sector partnerships between industry, higher education, and government can create new r&d outcomes, prepare workers, and fuel local economies. second, this legislation will improve access to supportive services like access to tools, work attire, transportation, childcare, and mentorship, which are crucial to helping workers stay in their training and in the workplace and to thrive. third, this legislation will define and formally authorize funding for pre-apprenticeship programs. in oregon, we have tremendous programs, successful programs, like oregon tradeswomen, that prepare women for careers and trades through pre-apprenticeships. despite the success of this program and others, funding has been extremely low. this legislation will help expand these life-changing programs and set participants up for success in apprenticeships and beyond. these are life-changing. importantly, this legislation will make job corps more inclusive by requiring job corps center operators to implement a tiered disciplinary system instead of adhering to a zero-tolerance drug policy. it would expand the definition of ``individuals with barriers to employment'' to include historically disadvantaged communities. these changes will modernize job corps in important ways, and it will better meet the needs of all communities. i urge my colleagues to support this workforce innovation opportunity act reauthorization to help close the skills gap and to address the needs of working americans, and i thank chairman scott for his leadership in bringing this important bill to the floor. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. grothman). mr. grothman. madam speaker, i will make some comments on the reauthorization bill. this is one of these big bills that is 268 pages. i do not have time to go through all of the problems with the bill, but i am just going to touch on some highlights, or low lights. in this area of high inflation, with a bill like this, the first thing i look at is the cost. the cost of this bill--right now, we are spending about $9.9 billion on this topic. over the next 6 years, they expect it to increase to $16.2 billion. you are looking at a 63 percent increase in spending on this area at a time where we really do not have any money to increase anything. so i want the american public to understand there is a big spending increase here. secondly, i will talk about a very important population to me, though a population that is not talked about enough, and that is the fact that we are continuing to allow a provision in law which i think is damaging to people born with different abilities. right now, they are not able to work at work centers, which is one of these places that sometimes pays under minimum wage, until they are at least 24 years old. we would never tell anybody of other abilities that you are not allowed to work until you are age 24. but by making it--i will not say impossible, but very difficult to work at a work center until age 24, i think you stunt the people's growth. i was really hoping we would use this opportunity to allow people with different abilities to begin to work at 18 or 19 years old. anybody who tours these work centers cannot help but be touched by how proud these folks are to work there. i wish they could work there at age 18 instead of 24. the next thing i will point out is a clear feature of this bill is to dramatically expand job corps; in other words, government jobs that are a steppingstone, i guess, if you cannot find another job. there has never been a time, i think, in american history in which they are looking for more people to work. so as i go around my district, be it the service industry, agriculture, light manufacturing, they are begging for employees. what is congress going to do? they are going to go in there and say, no, we are not going to let you work at the local restaurant; we are going to have you work for job corps. i think that is a mistake. the fourth thing i will point out is this obsession with racial biases and gender identity. there is a bill right now that the majority party has that is called the lgbt data inclusion act, in which they expect everybody, i guess, to tell their employer what their sexual preferences are. i have been doing this job in politics for a long time. i have never had a discussion about sexual preferences with any of my employees. i would feel embarrassed to ask them. but this bill clearly implies a world in which when you apply for a job, let us talk about our sexual identity. the fifth thing i point out is we have a big problem in this country at our southern border. in this bill, in committee, we tried to have e- verify to apply to all of these jobs; in other words, to make sure that if we are going to have such a program, at least it is american citizens who take advantage of the program. that amendment was shot down in committee. what does that tell me? it tells me that one more time, along with free medical care, along with pell grants, the majority party wants to help out people who are coming here who should not be here. e-verify really should have been part of the bill. i do not think the american public wants another government program designed, at least in part, to benefit people who are here illegally. those are some of the greatest hits of the bill. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana (mr. mrvan), a distinguished member of the committee on education and labor. mr. mrvan. madam speaker, i rise today in strong support of the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022. i have long believed that there is a role for public servants to create the conditions that help our fellow citizens obtain a good- paying job. with a good-paying job, most folks have the time and the resources to take care of themselves, their families, and address the difficulties that sometimes arise in life. i appreciate that this legislation promotes the value of our workforce and focuses on the improvements to apprenticeship programs, digital literacy programs, and summer job programs for our youth. in my experience for 15 years as someone who helped upskill people, i worked very closely with workforce development in order to find jobs for people who are sitting across the table from me trying to make ends meet. this investment gives them hope and promise. it also absolutely addresses what all employers and all small businesses are looking for: a ready, skilled workforce in order to be able to get into the market quickly. when it comes to labor unions, i emphasize the investment in our labor unions. what they provide for my community, in indiana's first district, is livable wages, healthcare benefits that are affordable, safer workplaces, and secure retirement. when it comes to the prevailing wage, that prevailing wage sets a wage that allows for all programs and all development in my district. that is something that is sacred that allows us to be competitive, to have a safe workplace, and allows us to provide for families. northwest indiana is home to such a diverse and talented workforce, and i urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation so that communities and organizations throughout our nation have the resources to ensure that everyone has the opportunity and tools to thrive in our economy. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from arkansas (mr. hill). mr. hill. madam speaker, i thank ranking member foxx for her work and leadership on these important issues and for visiting my home state of arkansas many times in support of a better workforce. madam speaker, i rise today in opposition to h.r. 7309 due to its lack of innovation and lack of opportunity that i think is embedded in this legislation. it is a shame we are on the floor, yet again, debating a bill that the democratic majority crafted to please unions and bolster them at the expense of american workers, small businesses, and nonunion entities. {time} 1445 most employers want to provide work-based upskilling, but they are already hesitant to apply for federal funds. this bill will make that process even more complex and burdensome. in my home state of arkansas, we are a right-to-work state. this bill is harmful to my home state. there are many bad policies embedded in the bill that will harm the american workforce. this bill will expand federal control over workforce standards, limiting the rights of jobseekers. it will do this while mandating that union representation on state and local workforce development boards be expanded by 10 percent. most importantly, this bill will fail to expand opportunity access for jobseekers. it is clear that this bill was written to favor unions, not the full and diverse american workforce. this bill is deeply flawed and another example of the democratic majority being out of touch with working americans. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new york (mr. espaillat), a distinguished member of the committee on education and labor. mr. espaillat. madam speaker, after more than 2 years of instability during the pandemic, congress must ensure that all americans--all americans--have resources to access the job market, especially those who are typically left behind. each year, 600,000 individuals are released from incarceration, and nearly half of them have repeat contact with the criminal justice system within a year. there is a critical need to invest in reentry programs. the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022 does just that by guaranteeing the department of labor's reentry employment opportunities program is authorized at $500 billion by 2028. this investment will not only expand reentry employment assistance for adults, but also prevent in-school youth from dropping out of school, increase the employment rate of out-of-school youth, and reduce the involvement of youth in crime and violence. programs carried out through the reentry employment grant program recognize that youth can and will lead healthy and constructive lives. these resources can mean the difference between a revolving door of prison time or a life full of economic opportunities. for those reasons, madam speaker, and all the other significant provisions in this bill, such as building community college capacity and strengthening industry and sector partnership, i urge all of my colleagues to support the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, in fy 2021, taxpayers spent about $1.8 billion on adult, dislocated worker, and youth activities under title i of wioa. according to the department of labor, only $537 million, or less than 30 percent of that money, went toward ``training services.'' most people assume that our nation's workforce development system is primarily focused on providing workers the skills they need to be successful in the modern economy. unfortunately, that is not accurate. not surprisingly, with so little focus on actual skills development, the outcomes for these programs are poor. among youth participants, less than one-quarter exited the program with employment in an occupation related to the services they received from the system. among adults and dislocated workers, a little more than one-third exited with employment related to their program. republicans would like to address these shortcomings and believe this reauthorization presents an opportunity to do that. the republican proposal we offered during committee, and to the rules committee, increases the percentage of funding going toward skills development. we proposed reforms to bring more employers to the table and engage more employers in the workforce system. unfortunately, the democrats' bill rejects those proposals and, instead, would actually make these problems worse. as a result of provisions in h.r. 7309, an even smaller portion of wioa funding will be directed toward skills development. the bill will also dilute employers' involvement in state and local governance of the workforce system, which is the opposite of what we should be doing. madam speaker, this bill is a missed opportunity. i urge my colleagues to oppose the base bill so we can get back to work and truly reform this program to get more workers the skills they need to fill the economy's open jobs. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from connecticut (mr. courtney), a distinguished member of the committee on education and labor. mr. courtney. madam speaker, i rise today in strong support of the workforce innovation and opportunity act, which will modernize america's job training program at precisely the time that we need it the most. today in america, for every one unemployed person, there are two job openings. again, i do not care what sector you are talking about, whether it is manufacturing, whether it is healthcare, whether it is information technology, whether you are from a red state or a blue state, the hue and cry from employers who are desperate to find workers is one of the most powerful challenges that we face in this economy. it is a good challenge. it is about connecting people to opportunities and to jobs or careers, which this bill is precisely designed to do. again, if you want to talk about the problems that we are having with inflation and gas prices, well, listen to the oil and gas industry. they are 100,000 workers short today, so they cannot increase supply because they do not have the workforce to do the drilling that is necessary. in my district, where i have electric boat's shipyard, which has used the workforce innovation and opportunity act in the past, there are 725 job openings this morning in the metal trades, in design and engineering work. the existing workforce innovation and opportunity act, which, again, uses the collaboration of employers and unions to design a curriculum that matches the work that happens in that shipyard, in the metal trades and other areas, has been extremely successful. they graduated their 2,000th graduate, who immediately was employed and is working in that shipyard. again, that is going to be a career for that individual to support themselves and their family. the challenge we have before us is we need to size up that preapprenticeship critical link that this program addresses by passing this legislation. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from connecticut. mr. courtney. if you read the bill, it doubles the number of slots that workforce boards like mine in eastern connecticut, and the 500 workforce boards that exist around the country will again then be able to address that critical need that exists right now today. it does it in a way that has been on the books since the clinton administration passed the workforce investment act back in the 1990s. again, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were part of the bill signing with president obama in 2014 when we authorized it the last time. this bill is very much aligned with the structure, but it enlarges it, and it reaches out to underserved populations and other individuals who can take advantage of and succeed with the tools that this bill will provide. again, now is the time. we need to vote on this measure today. we need to get it through the senate, and our economy will benefit. our nation will benefit. vote in favor of the workforce innovation and opportunity act. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, could you advise as to how much time is remaining on both sides? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from virginia has 18 minutes remaining. the gentlewoman from north carolina has 15\3/4\ minutes remaining. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. levin), a distinguished member of the committee on education and labor. mr. levin of michigan. madam speaker, i rise in strong support of the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022. as michigan's former chief workforce officer, i know firsthand how vital job training is to help communities transform economic challenges into opportunities for all. about 15 years ago, during the crisis in the auto industry, and then during the great recession, we created what, at the time, was the largest job training program of any state, called no worker left behind. we put 162,000 un- and underemployed michiganians back to school to study for in-demand jobs, certificates, degrees, whatever their local workforce board said was needed. lord knows, as mr. courtney said, at this moment, when employers are crying out for trained workers to fill positions, we need to pass this bill. let me touch on four highlights of the legislation. first, it corrects years of underfunding by authorizing $74 billion over the next 6 years. second, it gives greater voice to workers by increasing representation of labor organizations on state and local workforce boards. third, it makes permanent and allocates $2.25 billion over 6 years for the labor department's reentry employment opportunities program so that returning citizens can both obtain and sustain employment. we are seeing employers go into prisons in innovative ways and help people have opportunities for hope in their life, which is the surest way to cut recidivism. fourth, it authorizes public libraries to serve as affiliated one- stop sites, a priority i pushed to include in the legislation. madam speaker, i am always about those public libraries. effective workforce training is a crucial tool to spur job creation, fight long-term unemployment, and reduce inequality. by increasing funding and giving workers of all backgrounds a stronger voice, this proposal strengthens our workforce development system. madam speaker, i congratulate chairman scott on his leadership in shepherding this legislation, and i urge my colleagues to vote for the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from tennessee (mr. cohen). mr. cohen. madam speaker, this is just one of the things that the caucus and the congress have been doing to help make the economy improve and help people deal with problems that covid has caused us, supply chain and all, which has slowed down the opportunity to get products, and also causes inflation, but having the workforce innovation and opportunity act to get people training, get them career services, get skills to perform jobs is so important. i think it was mr. courtney who mentioned how many more openings we have than people to fill the jobs right now. i went to walgreens the other day and thought i got there early to get the drive-in, and they said: ``we do not have enough employees to have the drive-in open this morning.'' everywhere you go, there is need for work, so we need to train people so they can fill the jobs that are made available. i am proud to vote for this bill, reauthorizing the program, which, unfortunately, expired in 2020. this would put us back on track and invest $78 billion over 6 years and retrain millions of workers per year by 2028. memphis is a proud working-class city, and we must prepare our workforce and our community for the 21st century and for the jobs right now. the workforce innovation and opportunity act will ensure that critical resources are provided for essential institutions like our benjamin l. hooks job corps center in whitehaven. this transformational work should involve all of our local leaders and resources to ensure our programs and solutions are relevant and useful to our community. i offered an amendment, which was accepted, and i appreciate that. it will help ensure the subject matter experts in local agencies, local educators, and community leaders can be included as part of the workforce development boards. we look out for each other in memphis, and we want to see us move forward in the 21st century. madam speaker, i encourage everybody to vote for this bill. {time} 1500 ms. foxx. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. cartwright). mr. cartwright. madam speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding, and i appreciate the opportunity to speak about my critical amendment to the workforce innovation and opportunity act. as a nation, what we want to do is help our young working population find jobs and meet their career potential. that is exactly what youthbuild has done for the last 40 years. the youthbuild program funds workforce training initiatives focused on 16- to 24-year-old individuals without a high school diploma. these young adults come from challenging backgrounds and they need skills and resources to successfully participate in the domestic labor market, and youthbuild gives them just that opportunity. however, there is always room for improvement--and that is why we have this amendment--especially when it comes to ensuring that young adults with disabilities are best positioned to successfully enter the workforce. currently, lack of affordable and accessible transportation creates significant barriers for disabled people that want to work. madam speaker, 13.4 million americans have disabilities which limit their ability to travel, including traveling to the workplace. we have to ensure that transportation to and from the workplace is available for disabled youth transitioning into the workforce. my amendment to the workforce innovation and opportunity act allows disabled youthbuild participants to use funds for transportation. with this amendment, we can remove a massive obstacle from the path of these disabled young adults. we can make going to work one step easier so they can earn a living and support their families. no american should be deprived of a fair chance to become and remain productive members of our american society. madam speaker, i urge my fellow members to support my amendment and allow designated youthbuild funding to be used for work-related transportation. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from florida (mr. rutherford). mr. rutherford. madam speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding. madam speaker, at the appropriate time, i will offer an amendment to h.r. 7309, which will increase skills development for individuals seeking careers in law enforcement, especially in these states that we have seen increasing violent crime. my amendment would modify the list of employment and workforce development activities that states must carry out with state set-aside funding under the adult and dislocated worker programs. this amendment requires that states that have experienced an increase in violent crime over the previous year use those state set-aside funds to provide training services for individuals seeking a career in law enforcement. those funds must also support training services for law enforcement involved in border protection in relevant states. after 2 years of my colleagues across the aisle calling to defund the police, we are seeing cities in america in crisis. police agency budgets have been slashed, making it impossible to hire, equip, and train officers. these calls have demoralized and delegitimized officers, causing high attrition rates and making it nearly impossible to hire new officers. criminals have noticed, and violent crime is rising because of it. just look at the news any night. it has made the already dangerous job of law enforcement even more dangerous and unsafe. and in 2021, an officer was attacked and killed every five days in america. madam speaker, all our communities are less safe because of it. this police week, instead of focusing on supporting law enforcement's hiring and retention and making our communities safer, my colleagues are forcing a partisan, flawed approach to labor force development. but my amendment will help build the workforce that we really need to focus on, and that is peace officers. at a time when law enforcement retirements are up 45 percent nationwide, and some cities still cannot fill up to 17 percent of their open positions, we desperately need to invest in retraining law enforcement officers. as a former law enforcement officer myself, i know firsthand the importance of developing a strong pipeline of law enforcement cadets. we are far from that now so we must direct our federal workforce investments to career fields that directly and positively impact the safety of our communities across america. if we adopt the motion to recommit, we will instruct the committee on education and labor to consider my amendment to invest in the next generation of our law enforcement officers. madam speaker, i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to recommit. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from florida? there was no objection. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from connecticut (mrs. hayes), a distinguished member of the committee on education and labor. mrs. hayes. madam speaker, i rise to support the passage of this bill, the workforce innovation and opportunity act, a historic, $78 billion investment, which will provide training for 1 million workers per year by 2028. this package includes my bill, the youthbuild for the future act, which would invest $1 billion into youthbuild over 6 years. youthbuild is a crucial program that is specifically built to help young people who have not completed their high school degree train for a high-wage, stable career. but most importantly, it helps those young people regain their confidence and their ability to be self-sufficient and contribute to our communities. my bill makes critical investments to the program, such as reserving grant funds for rural areas, extending the period of follow-up services to 2 years, and allowing youthbuild to fund meals for participants. these improvements will expand opportunity for young adults and employers who are clamoring to fill skilled positions that too often remain vacant. these are meaningful, life-changing investments for americans searching for long-term, high-wage employment. i know that these programs work because the one in my district and my hometown has young kids building homes. madam speaker, as an original cosponsor of this reauthorization, i am proud to support passage, and i urge my colleagues to do the same. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, by reversing some of the key reforms made in the bipartisan 2014 wioa reauthorization, h.r. 7309 takes our workforce system backwards. it does this by imposing more bureaucratic hurdles to job creators and reducing program accountability. it is time to stop being so frivolous with taxpayer dollars. this bill proposes pouring more money into an already expensive program. in fy 2021, taxpayers spent $1.8 billion on programs under title 1 of wioa alone. this is too much money, especially as inflation is still at a 41-year high. the house of representatives has been entrusted with the power of the purse. it is time we took this responsibility more seriously. the nation deserves a workforce system that will actually prepare americans for in-demand jobs. unfortunately, this bill fails to protect taxpayers at a time of rampant inflation, pushes a radical progressive agenda, expands federal control over the workforce, and embraces that failed status quo rather than pursuing opportunities for innovation. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, the evidence is clear that our economy has made meaningful progress toward recovering from the pandemic. thanks to the efforts of congress and the biden-harris administration, our economy has added a record 8.3 million jobs since the start of 2021, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6 percent. despite this progress, we know that job openings currently exceed job applicants and employers are clamoring for skilled workers. in fact, research suggests that workers are leaving their job to seek better career opportunities in record numbers. this bill takes a critical step forward to empower workers to fill those competitive job positions and, in turn, helps reduce supply chain shortages, lower costs for families, increase their incomes, and improve our business competitiveness. madam speaker, investing in workforce development has historically been a priority for both democrats and republicans. that is why our committee conducted an extended bipartisan process to put this legislation together, despite the opposition we have heard from our colleagues today. as our economy rebounds from the pandemic, we should all agree that we must take this opportunity to expand access to high-quality job training opportunities for america's workers. i thank my colleague again, ms. wilson, for her leadership in bringing this critical legislation to the floor, and i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022. madam speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. sablan. madam speaker, h.r. 7309, the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022, makes significant improvements to wioa, the law that is the backbone of our nation's workforce development system. since 2014, wioa has provided training and career services to help working people across the country get the skills they need and help employers secure a qualified workforce. h.r. 7309 also includes legislation i authored that extends three crucial workforce development programs to the marianas: the wagner- peyser grant, the integrated english literacy and civic education grant, and the job corps program. under my employment services and jobs parity act, the annual $300,000 wagner-peyser grant would provide skill assessment, career guidance, and referrals to training to job seekers in the marianas. the legislation additionally allows the commonwealth government to apply for employment service formula grants, at the same percentage share as guam, to set up one-stop career centers that can help workers find jobs and employers find workers. under my integrated english literacy and civic education nationwide act, english language learners would acquire the proficiency needed to obtain employment. and under my job corps nationwide act, job corps centers can be established in all insular areas. this means our young people would not have to leave the marianas to get necessary training and local business would benefit from a skilled workforce connected to our community and committed to remaining. all my bills support the overall goal of h.r. 7309: to help job seekers nationwide access quality employment, education training, and support services. by reauthorizing and strengthening wioa's programs, h.r. 7309 will help americans get back to work. in addition to my provisions, the legislation expands summer and year-round jobs programs for youth, codifies partnerships between employers and community colleges, and provides funding for innovative approaches to workforce development. at a time when the covid-19 pandemic has diminished the resources necessary to train new workers, the improvements to wioa under h.r. 7309 will continue to develop the workforce pipeline and expand access to services for the people who need them the most. i urge my colleagues to support the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022. ms. jackson lee. madam speaker, h.r. 7309 is truly transformational legislation that will have a profound impact on workforce development and job skills training for decades to come. by virtue of this legislation, the american economy will be well positioned for success in emerging industries as well as traditional jobs in an increasingly competitive global landscape. with the new initiatives and support for state and local efforts that this bill provides, more institutions will be able to provide education and job training services; a wider range of curricula will be available that enables learners to become job-ready; and more americans will be equipped with skills that will jump-start long-term careers. very importantly, this bill will extend the reach of job skills training and employment preparation to all corners of the country and all segments of society. it does so by creating vital national programs and instituting accountability systems that will monitor program operations and success. this legislation also ensures that students will have access to training through online digital platforms. use of e-learning opens the doors for education even where cultural barriers and long distances from brick-and-mortar institutes often had the effect of excluding many americans. as enthusiastic as i am about this legislation and its comprehensive approach toward elevating our country's workforce preparation infrastructure, there are additional elements that i believed were necessary. we must ensure that diversity, inclusion, and equity are always cornerstones of our economy and society; and ensure that this bill will prepare all demographic groups with our workforce for success in key industries that are vital to our nation's future economy. as a result, i submitted amendments to the workforce innovation and opportunity act, and i am delighted that the rules committee agreed that these were important additions to h.r. 7309. i would like to share a few thoughts with my colleagues and the american people about my two amendments which are being considered by the house of representatives today. my first amendment stems from my fervent and long-held belief that women and girls should have a level playing field for any type of study, job, or career. throughout my life, i have fought for women and girls to have equal opportunity to learn in classrooms, excel in workplaces, and achieve in life. where women faced walls, i sought to tear down the walls or lean a ladder against them to climb over. when girls were being discouraged from educational or career pursuits, i set out to change mindsets. when females faced biases or glass ceilings that restrained success, i organized and marched to level the playing field. as a result, my first amendment would ensure that women and girls are encouraged to enroll for stem education, that is, the study of science, technology, engineering, and math. these subjects are the key to success in a vast range of industries and professions, especially in this advanced era in which information and technology propels most innovations and program. women and girls must be welcomed for a seat at those tables, which will dramatically impact gender equality over time. in addition to being encouraged to enroll, i believe girls and women should receive priority for both the study of these fields and the jobs and careers that await them, and that support services should be provided to them along the way to help ensure their success. the days of male-dominated stem-based industries must be relegated to history books, as that bias has no place in modern america. because of entrenched, long-standing discrimination against women and girls, not only do we need equality; we also need equity. in other words, more must be done to right the wrongs of the past, prioritize participation by women and girls, and fast-track us for promotions, advancement, and success. my second amendment is rooted in similar concerns. it insists that this legislation help all americans, specifically communities of color that historically did not benefit equally from workforce development and job skills training programs. my amendment would ensure that hbcus and other minority-serving educational institutions are eligible and encouraged to apply for maximal benefits under h.r. 7309's programs. moreover, beyond just equality, the job training and workforce development programs at these institutions should be given priority in order to promote equity for students whose ancestors were denied that right. h.r. 7309 can be the impetus for a fresh start. by including and prioritizing hbcus and other minority-serving institutions, the institutionalized barriers which impeded generational prosperity will be eroded, even if only incrementally and over many years. by leveling the playing field, the imbalance of generational wealth will also be rectified. madam speaker, i believe these two amendments are central to the purpose of the workforce innovation and opportunity act, and will strengthen the bill both legislatively and in practice across the country. diversity and inclusion must always be a priority particularly in future high-growth industries that are essential to our nation's long-term economic growth, success, and and job creation strategy. the speaker pro tempore.

the gentleman from virginia (mr. scott) and the gentlewoman from north carolina (ms. foxx) each will control 10 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from virginia. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, this en bloc contains several bipartisan amendments from our colleagues to continue improving the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022. this en bloc contains commonsense proposals that strengthen the underlying bill, and i thank my colleagues for their contributions. madam speaker, i strongly urge support for both the en bloc and the underlying bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, this en bloc includes several amendments that i believe would improve the underlying legislation so i will vote for the en bloc. unfortunately, i must also note that the en bloc includes three amendments to which i have concerns. the gottheimer amendment reduces the flexibility the workforce system needs to meet the needs of workers. the harder amendment will reduce the percentage of funds going to help youth receive the skills they need to enter the workforce. and the lee amendment authorizes a duplicative study that would not be a reasonable use of taxpayer funds. however, on balance, this en bloc will improve the underlying legislation. this group of amendments better focuses wioa on in-demand jobs, decreases duplication by encouraging better alignment between k- 12 education providers and local workforce development boards, and includes information on entrepreneurship in career and skills development services. madam speaker, i hope my colleagues will support this set of amendments, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from ohio (ms. kaptur), the chair of the subcommittee on energy and water development of the committee on appropriations, and a strong supporter of sector grant training. {time} 1515 ms. kaptur. madam speaker, i thank chairman scott for his astounding leadership on this critical jobs training bill and for yielding me time. i thank ranking member foxx so very much for her support of this effort. today, i urge my colleagues to support a bipartisan amendment to the workforce innovation and opportunity act that i have proposed alongside representatives kelly, dingell, and ryan. as we set about this new era of automotive and vehicular innovation, it is crucial that we invest in the workers who are the backbone of this uniquely american industry. this amendment will create a pathway for the federal department of labor and other federal agencies to conduct a study on the automotive service technician and vehicle mechanic workforce and help promote apprenticeships to meet the increasing need of this advanced sector. already, america is short 1 million trained workers across our nation, and we have not gotten started. we are not off the starting line. electric-, hydrogen-, and biofuel-powered vehicle technology brings new opportunities and new challenges. to be ready, we must proactively stand up for training and apprenticeship programs that prepare america's vehicular workforce for the next generation. the motor vehicle industry has long served as a gateway to the middle class, and this amendment allows the federal government to take deliberate steps to ensure our workers are top of mind, not left behind. it is vital that we invest in the workers who make, build, and grow america and, frankly, power her. i ask that my colleagues join me in passing this important amendment. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. gottheimer). mr. gottheimer. madam speaker, i rise in support of my amendment to the workforce innovation and opportunity act. first, i thank all of our brave veterans for putting their lives on the line to defend our freedom and our families. after sacrificing so much, no veteran should ever have to struggle to get the care and resources they have earned. we should always have their backs. my provision today will do just that, ensuring that veterans have access to high-quality job training, workforce development, and career navigation services. these skills will help our veterans transition back into civilian life, reach their career goals, and care for their families. we know that veterans have the skills to make them exceptional workers, but they often face barriers to employment. data shows that unemployment rates are higher for veterans than nonveterans. my amendment will ensure that veterans are prioritized to receive federal career resources, and it builds on the work i have helped lead, working across the aisle since i was elected to support our veterans and their families. the first piece of legislation i passed in congress was to expand hiring of post-9/11 veterans. today, we have the opportunity to fight for them like they fought for us. i urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and i thank the chairman for his leadership. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from nevada (mr. horsford). mr. horsford. madam speaker, i thank the chairman for yielding. today, i rise in support of my amendment to the workforce innovation and opportunity act, which will ensure performance measures and accountability indicators for recognized postsecondary credentials are made publicly available. now is the time for us to invest in our constituents and the workforce. as we do so, i cannot stress enough how important it is for congress to mandate collecting and publicly reporting data on our job training programs. that includes publicly reporting on performance measures and economic outcomes, such as the types of jobs, wages, and long-term career progression. having performance measures and accountability indicators publicly available will allow us to direct federal resources in an equitable way so that we are getting support to individuals and programs that have been historically underfunded. i encourage my colleagues to support my amendment, and i look forward to voting for this critical investment in our workers for nevada and for all americans. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, i reiterate that this is an en bloc amendment containing commonsense, bipartisan proposals that strengthen the underlying bill. i strongly urge support for both the en bloc amendment and the underlying bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, the amendments in this en bloc will refocus the workforce development system on the individuals it was created to serve: jobseekers and employers. we must make sure that wioa is helping all american jobseekers get the skills they need to compete in our modern economy. we must also make sure that wioa programs are helping employers connect with skilled workers, instead of saddling them with unnecessary requirements that have no proven effectiveness. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. lee of california. madam speaker, i rise today in support of my amendment to the workforce innovation and opportunity act. my bipartisan amendment with congressman fleischmann authorizes the secretary of labor and the secretary of education to conduct a study on the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) workforce and stem education. this amendment would provide data on the number of stem jobs currently available and anticipated expansion in the field, the number of stem and computer science classes in public secondary schools, and policy solutions to expand access for individuals with barriers to employment, such as those from low income and minority communities, and those from rural communities. this data will be helpful for us to understand this rapidly expanding sector and to ensure the united states is able to remain a global leader in the technology industry. this amendment builds off my bipartisan bill, h.r. 3602 the computer science for all act that rep. fleischmann also co-leads with me which would create grants to increase access to computer science education for prek-12 students. i urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bipartisan amendment. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 1119, the previous

myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, this en bloc amendment contains additional democratic amendments from my colleagues to continue improving the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2022. this en bloc amendment contains proposals that strengthen the underlying bill, and i thank my colleagues for their contributions. i strongly urge support for both the en bloc amendment and the underlying bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, i rise in opposition to the amendment. this democratic en bloc creates new programs, authorizes new funding, expands bureaucracy on workforce development boards, imposes new mandates on states and local areas, detracts from skills development services, and transforms wioa from a workforce program into a welfare program. this laundry list of problems is not what our nation's jobseekers need. i cannot agree to saddle employers and workers with new federal mandates that will make it harder for them to grow the economy and better individual lives. i urge my colleagues to oppose the package, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from delaware (ms. blunt rochester), who is a former member of the committee on education and labor and a strong supporter of workforce development. ms. blunt rochester. madam speaker, i thank chairman scott for his leadership. i am proud to have my amendments to h.r. 7309 before the house today. in particular, i am proud of amendment no. 3, which gained the support of 42 of my colleagues. this amendment would establish grants to help break the cycle of violence in communities by providing job and workforce development opportunities to youth in communities disproportionately affected by gun violence. with this broad support, i call on my colleagues to support this amendment, which helps reduce community violence the best way we know how--by building pipelines to good-paying, high-quality jobs for youth that are disconnected from school and the workforce--to create opportunity, to improve lives, and to provide for the future. madam speaker, i thank the chairman, again, for his leadership. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. i reiterate that this en bloc amendment contains commonsense proposals that will strengthen the underlying bill. madam speaker, i strongly urge support for both the en bloc amendment and the underlying bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, we should focus on empowering jobseekers to select skills development providers that will prepare them for in-demand jobs and make sure that employers are involved in this process so we can close the skills gap. we should also streamline the workforce system so that funding is not wasted on unnecessary bureaucracy and administrative overhead. this funding should instead be directed toward upskilling workers. unfortunately, this democratic en bloc misses the mark on each of these fronts. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to oppose this group of amendments, and i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore (ms. kaptur). pursuant to

minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from virginia. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, this en bloc amendment contains several amendments which i oppose; therefore, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. good). mr. good of virginia. madam speaker, democrats believe that the government should control everything: what kind of car you drive, whether you have to get a vaccine, how or if you get to heat or cool your home, if you can keep your job, and if you can open or operate your business. republicans, on the other hand, believe that americans should control their own lives, their purchasing decisions, their healthcare decisions, and even their businesses and apprenticeship programs. businessowners across the country try to utilize apprenticeships to develop the skilled employees that they need to succeed and grow. sadly, this democratic bill only funds government-approved apprenticeships that are registered with the department of labor, not those designed by businessowners who have the audacity to think that they know more about their business than those with no business experience, like president biden and the progressive activists that make up his administration. {time} 1530 why would anyone trust joe biden to run their business? he has no private sector experience, but he is now the proud owner of the worst economic record in modern history--so there is that. why would anyone trust democrats in this congress or this administration to run their business? these former educators, lawyers, community organizers, and progressive activists have ruined the outstanding economy that they inherited in january of 2021. house democrats demand that you have your apprenticeship program designed by unelected bureaucrats in the department of labor because, of course, washington knows best when it comes to everything. look what they have done with inflation, supply chains, rising crime, the open border, and everything else. they are a picture of success. if washington truly knew best, then one in four businesses would not have closed permanently in my home state of virginia due to democrat covid restrictions. employers in my district often ask me: why do they have to submit to government control to be eligible for funding for their apprenticeship program? who could do a better job developing apprenticeships than the people who, you know, actually create the jobs; despite washington's best efforts to prevent them from doing so? that question was rhetorical, please do not answer. my amendment would actually let employers run their own apprenticeship programs and help them educate their workers the way they need to so they can expand their workforces. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support my amendment. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. this en bloc includes several amendments that i believe would vastly improve the underlying legislation. first, these amendments would bring needed flexibility and innovation to the workforce development system when it comes to apprenticeships. democrats have, unfortunately, chosen to double down on the outdated registered apprenticeship model rather than meet employers where they are at. this group of amendments includes proposals that encourage innovation to occur so that apprenticeships can meet the needs of more employers. second, one of the amendments would ensure that states provide a realistic and workable timetable for awarding grants and contracts for adult basic education. this is simply good governance. states should not hold on to funding indefinitely that is intended to be directed toward jobseekers. this amendment will make sure the funding goes where it is intended and does not get stuck with bureaucrats to the detriment of individuals seeking basic education services. third, wioa should be focused first and foremost on providing skills development services for jobseekers. it is unfortunate that h.r. 7309 adds vague language encouraging supportive services to include ``healthcare supports.'' while i was pleased that the longstanding hyde amendment was secured and will apply to wioa funds for fiscal year 2022 appropriations, i will always fight to see the hyde amendment applied to ensure federal funds do not support the killing of babies. it is of utmost importance that taxpayer dollars do not go to pay for killing babies, and this amendment would guarantee that. the right to life is our most fundamental and sacred right and must always be protected. i will always remain vigilant to ensure that taxpayer funds do not pay for the killing of babies. madam speaker, i hope my colleagues will support this set of amendments, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i am the only speaker on this side. i am prepared to close, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i have a couple of other speakers, so i am not prepared to close. madam speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from new york (mr. jacobs). mr. jacobs of new york. madam speaker, i rise in support of my amendment, which would be of great benefit to adult learners across this country, and especially in my home state of new york. new york state has had issues over the last several years in distributing these funds promptly. independent programs typically operate on very thin budgets, so any delay in funding puts their operations in jeopardy. my amendment would ensure states are held accountable for distributing funding promptly by requiring the states to provide a timeline for distributing grants and contracts for adult basic education in the unified state plan, and specifying that funds must be distributed in a timely manner. the typical adult learner benefiting from title ii funding is either an individual who was not able to access a k-12 education as a child or is a recent immigrant. last september, i visited one of the adult education programs in my district, literacy west new york, and i walked away very impressed by the adult learners there. life certainly has not been easy for them, but that has not stopped them from pressing on and working to improve their lives. it is important we make sure that the resources promised to our nation's adult learners, and the programs that support them, are available. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from illinois (mrs. miller). mrs. miller of illinois. madam speaker, my amendment puts strong protections in place so that no funds in this bill can go toward harming the unborn. the underlying bill includes a provision that allows taxpayer dollars to be used for health and mental healthcare support. without the protections my amendment offers, this funding could go to counseling young pregnant women to seek abortions. this is wrong. a child in the womb is a distinct, developing, whole human being. in my home state of illinois, our leftist governor announced this week he will take federal funding from title 10 and give it to planned parenthood of illinois. this goes directly against federal law and the hyde amendment. those on the other side of this aisle, in this body, use every opportunity to get rid of the hyde amendment. that is why my amendment is so important. the growing hostility toward the hyde amendment is alarming and means we must be vigilant in our efforts to ensure program dollars authorized by congress cannot be used for abortions or abortion services. god is the author of life, not congress. the taking of life through abortion is an assault on the image of god. abortion is not healthcare, despite what the left says, and we should not force taxpayers to violate their morals or strongly held beliefs by forcing them to pay for it. my amendment ensures that they will not. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i am prepared to close, and i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, the amendments in this en bloc will refocus the workforce development system on the individuals it was created to serve: jobseekers and employers. we must make sure that wioa is helping all american jobseekers get the skills they need to compete in our modern economy. we must also make sure that wioa programs are helping employers connect with skilled workers instead of saddling them with unnecessary requirements that have no proven effectiveness. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, i focus my comments on two of the amendments in this en bloc that undermine the improvements we are putting forward in this legislation. the first strikes language from the bill that prevents nonregistered apprenticeships from receiving wioa funds. if you want to have a nonregistered apprenticeship program you can do that, but we ought to fund the registered programs first since they are much better, and we should not spend money on those nonregistered programs. registered apprenticeship programs are a proven strategy that have demonstrated high-quality training and wage progression across multiple industries. this bill supports efforts to expand registered apprenticeships to additional populations and industries, by reserving 50 percent of the funds for programs serving individuals with barriers to employment. many of my colleagues have opposed the so-called industry-recognized apprenticeship programs, or iraps, because that program discards key features that are the cause of success for our registered apprenticeship program, including quality standards, worker protections, national recognition, and the fact that virtually all registered apprenticeship graduates end up in jobs that pay well above the median wage. the second amendment in this en bloc amendment group prohibits wioa funds from being used to reimburse any healthcare services. i am not sure where they find that physical health is included. mental health counseling and substance abuse is included as possible funding. the question about whether wioa will pay for health services is a distraction from the work we are trying to do today, to ensure an equitable recovery, and provide opportunity for economic advancement for all individuals in all communities. this legislation reflects the input from stakeholders across the country who know what it takes to expand access to high-quality job training, career navigation services, and other critical services. the statute has long provided for flexibility for local programs. the statute also allows for the provision of supportive services, such as assistance with transportation, childcare, dependent care, or housing; services that are crucial to facilitating individuals' ability to participate in wioa-funded programs. in fact, the legislation specifically ensures that treatment of substance use disorder is a permissible use of supportive services under wioa. fundamentally, needs of individuals seeking job training are not always distinct from health needs. these programs should meet people where they are to facilitate full participation to ensure continued and sustained economic success. updating and improving programs authorized through wioa, such as the bill we are considering today, will lift up communities and help us achieve that goal. this is what we need to do today by voting ``no'' on this en bloc amendment and ``yes'' on the underlying bill. madam speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore (ms. blunt rochester). pursuant to house resolution 1119, the previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from virginia (mr. scott). the question is on the amendments en bloc. the question was taken;

1119, the gentlewoman from iowa (mrs. miller-meeks) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from iowa. mrs. miller-meeks. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, following the pandemic, the nation's workforce needs have drastically changed, and we need a workforce development system that helps prepare american workers for the job opportunities of today and tomorrow, not those of the past. the workforce innovation and opportunity act is intended to help unemployed and underemployed workers get the necessary skills to succeed in america's modern economy. unfortunately, the majority's proposed reauthorization lacks the necessary reforms to help america's workers. our republican proposal, on the other hand, would modernize the program to make sure it is employer-driven, which will help america's economy become stronger for decades to come. our plan puts taxpayer dollars to work where they need it most: helping jobseekers get the skills they need to close the skills gap and get back to work. {time} 1545 it does this by bringing more competition into the provider marketplace, which expands the pool of skills development providers that meet employers' needs and gives more choice to american workers, ensuring states and localities can use wioa funds to survey employers to get a better understanding of the skills that are most in demand and respond accordingly. additionally, the republican proposal adapts wioa to the changing economic landscape. america has just come through a pandemic. during that time, businesses, employers, and workers shifted to remote work and changing circumstances. our skills development and education programs should adapt to changing circumstances as well. our plan encourages workforce boards to provide services virtually, which streamlines wioa and eliminates administrative costs and overhead. republicans also ensure online skills development providers can be included in skills development services, expanding the number of providers who can address the needs that american workers face. the republican alternative also levels the playing field and encourages innovation by ensuring that wioa does not favor registered apprenticeships over more innovative apprenticeship models that can address the needs of more employers. this will keep america's labor force at the cutting edge of global competition. competition drives better results. through pay-for-performance funding, our substitute encourages programs with a proven track record of successfully helping american workers succeed. our proposal measures programs based on real outcomes and gives states and localities more flexibility in how they can improve those outcomes. we also increase transparency by making the process for creating job performance metrics available to the american public. finally, the republican plan brings greater accountability to the department of labor's job corps program and its reentry employment opportunities program. let us start with job corps. job corps is a popular program, and for many students, job corps is their last hope. there are important reforms we can enact to ensure that job corps is working better for students who need it most. our bill would help job corps-eligible students get technical and career education from community colleges, which would give this program much-needed innovation and better outcomes. the job corps program in ottumwa, iowa, in my district, is a wonderful example of how to do exactly this and is the right way to perform that program. it would also do more to keep job corps participants safe. centers would be required to report whenever any concerning incidents occur, ensuring proper oversight of this program. we also bring greater accountability to the reentry employment opportunities program so we can build on president trump's historic criminal justice reform and use this program to help formerly incarcerated americans establish firm economic foundations for their new lives. these are commonsense reforms that will help american employers and jobseekers. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i claim the time in opposition to the amendment. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. miller-meeks. madam speaker, i yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from north carolina (ms. foxx). ms. foxx. madam speaker, i thank my colleague from iowa (mrs. miller- meeks) for her great work on this committee and for bringing forth this amendment. it is an excellent amendment, and i support it. we need to do everything we can to improve the workforce development programs in our country. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. miller-meeks. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, we have had an opportunity to work together on wioa, but unfortunately, my colleagues in the majority are more concerned about maintaining the status quo and placating favored stakeholders. what american workers and employers need is a workforce system that prioritizes them over special interests, and the republican alternative would do that. i urge my colleagues to help us pass an alternative proposal that works for america, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, we are here today to modernize and reauthorize the nation's premier job training program to help jobseekers and workers connect with well-paying jobs and career pathways. although the substitute offered by our colleagues does not meet the urgent needs to strengthen the programs, i do want to make it clear that we welcome the opportunity to have further discussion as the bill heads toward the senate. my goal is to forge common ground wherever we can, and i am hoping that this can be the beginning, not the end, of the conversation. the republican substitute reauthorizes funding for the formula programs, regrettably, at roughly the same levels as we have today. the status quo is not working. as a result, the substitute will not provide the level of intensive training needed to move people into higher wage jobs. the average amount the adult formula program spends per participant today is about $2,000, not nearly enough to provide quality job training to lead to good jobs with competitive wages, benefits, and other hallmarks of job quality. the republican substitute continues the unacceptable status quo with respect to underinvestment in training. to meet the moment, the underlying bill also codifies sector grants, which are demonstrated to be effective in training workers for jobs in high-demand sectors. the gentlewoman from ohio (ms. kaptur) talked about electric cars. we need a lot of training in that area, but regrettably, the substitute omits the sector grants. our committee meetings held last year highlighted bipartisan support for reentry programs for justice-involved individuals. in response, the bill codifies the program at the department of labor and commits $250 million for fiscal year 2023, more than double the amount appropriated this year, and provides stable funding amounting to $2.3 billion over 6 years. with 600,000 individuals released from our prisons and jails each year, close to half of them experiencing repeat contact with the criminal justice system within a year, funding levels in the substitute do not come close to meeting the critical needs to invest in services to help these individuals obtain and retain employment. we also reject the requirement of the substitute for non-federal match to receive a grant. this matching requirement is not part of the existing grant program and would exclude many grassroots organizations that are best positioned to meet the needs of justice-involved individuals in our communities. when we provide subsidies to employers in the form of on-the-job training or customized training, we also need to make sure that it is matched by job quality. the republican substitute, regrettably, leaves too many disconnected youth behind. to help our youth, whether in school or not, gain life skills, the bill invests almost $1 billion in fiscal year 2023 for summer and year- round youth employment opportunities. the evidence is abundant that these youth employment opportunities increase lifelong earnings and reduce engagement in the criminal justice system. the republican substitute also fails to meet the moment and address the needs of the workers in the 21st century, so i urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. in the remaining time, madam speaker, i would like to thank members of my staff on the committee of education and labor. they worked hard on this legislation, starting with kevin mcdermott, scott estrada, lorin obler, phoebe ball, danyelle honore, jessica schieder, and former staff members richard miller and katie mcclelland. madam speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 1119, the previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from iowa (mrs. miller-meeks). the question is on the amendment
