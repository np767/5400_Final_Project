[[page h4933]] the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from oregon? there was no objection. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, i rise today in strong support of my bipartisan legislation, h.r. 5129, the community services block grant modernization act of 2022. in 1964, congress first established the community action program to support locally driven anti-poverty efforts. today, community action agencies, or caas, form a network of more than 1,000 organizations with a dedicated mission of assisting people in finding their way out of poverty. these agencies provide services and programs that meet the unique needs of our local communities by helping individuals and families with low incomes achieve economic stability, secure meaningful employment, and adequate education, gain and improve job-related skills, obtain housing, access childcare, and participate in the community. during our legislative hearing on updating the community services block grant, katherine king galian, the director of family and community resources at community action in washington county, oregon, told us the story about patricia. patricia lost her job and her home in the fall of 2019. facing unaffordable rent and a rising risk of homelessness, she turned to community action and she got the support she needed. at community action of washington county, she accessed career coaching, help affording needed materials for her nursing curriculum, and other services that helped patricia and her family get back on their feet. patricia's story is just one of many from all across the united states where community action agencies have been helping low- income americans get back on their feet for decades. unfortunately, the community services block grant program, csbg, has not been reauthorized since 1998, the year google was founded, and john glenn flew the discovery space shuttle mission. we are long overdue for congress to pass a comprehensive reauthorization of this significant law. our bill continues the long tradition of broad bipartisan support for this program and makes important improvements to update csbg. it will reauthorize csbg for 10 years--the longest period in its history--which will provide critical stability to our local service providers. recognizing that there are many more families like patricia's who can be served by csbg, our bill strengthens funding for community action agencies and raises the program's income eligibility threshold to expand access to their important services. i also highlight a provision championed by my friend and colead, congressman g.t. thompson, to create broadband navigator projects so community action agencies can assist their clients in accessing internet services and connected devices that are necessary for learning, finding employment, and other basic activities of everyday life. finally, the bill will modernize the statute to strengthen accountability and performance requirements, putting csbg on solid footing so the program can continue to meet the complex and changing needs of low-income individuals in communities without changing the local control that is such an important part of csbg's success. i very much appreciate the productive collaboration with my bipartisan partner from the education and labor committee, congressman thompson, and his staff, in leading this legislation. i also thank our other education and labor committee coleads, representatives desaulnier, stefanik, and comer for leading us in this effort. i must also knowledge congresswoman betty mccollum, who led early iterations of this proposal in prior congresses and has joined us this session to build on her foundational work to get this across the finish line. additionally, david bradley, the ceo of national community action foundation has been instrumental in offering his expertise to help us bring this bill to the floor today. finally, and importantly, i would thank chairman scott and his dedicated staff, particularly, theresa thompson, jessica schieder, emily hopkins, and carrie hughes, for working with us to bring this bill. i also thank my staff, allison smith, jack arriaga, andrew dunn, and rachael bornstein, who worked diligently on this bill from drafting and introduction through the committee markup. i urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill to renew our nation's commitment to reducing poverty through community action. additionally, i include in the record letters by the national community action foundation, national association of counties, and national association for state community service programs in support of passing the community services block grant modernization act of 2022. national community action foundation, may 10, 2022. hon. suzanne bonamici, house of representatives, washington, dc. hon. glenn thompson, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear rep. bonamici and rep. thompson: we are writing to you today to share our enthusiastic endorsement of your bipartisan legislation, hr 5129, the community services block grant (csbg) modernization act of 2022. as you know, csbg touches virtually every community in the united states. with 90 percent of each state's csbg allocation being distributed to local community action agencies (caas), our communities rely upon this unique flexible funding. caas use it to combat poverty and promote self-sufficiency, respond rapidly to unforeseen crises such as natural disasters and the covid-19 pandemic and implement gap-filling activities that address unmet community needs. additionally, caas use csbg to organize and support other local charities and community-based initiatives, ensuring services are streamlined and not duplicative. without csbg, every single community in america would be hurt. your bill would codify critical updates to the program. it provides security and reliability to communities across the country by authorizing csbg for 10 years and ensuring money flows in a timely manner. the crucial modernizations included in hr 5129, such as the new broadband navigator initiative, will increase caas' ability to respond to emerging needs. we are also pleased to see the emphasis on quality performance at the federal, state and local level and that the essential nature of csbg as a locally-controlled program is retained and bolstered. because of hr 5129's local impact in almost every county in the country, we join in support of the bill. we hope congress passes this essential piece of legislation quickly, thereby strengthening each community in america. sincerely, david bradley, ceo, national community action foundation;

[[page h4936]] ____ national association for state community services programs, may 9, 2022. rep. nancy pelosi, house speaker, house of representatives, washington, dc. rep. kevin mccarthy, minority leader, house of representatives, washington, dc. rep. steny hoyer, majority leader, house of representatives, washington, dc. rep. bobby scott, ed & labor committee chairman, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear madam speaker pelosi, majority leader hoyer, minority leader mccarthy, and chairman scott: my name is jeannie chaffin, and i am the interim executive director of the national association for state community services programs (nascsp). nascsp is the sole national association charged with advocating for and enhancing the leadership role of states in the administration of the community services block grant (csbg) and weatherization assistance program (wap) across all 50 states, washington d.c., and five u.s. territories. as the membership association for all community services block grant state offices, we are intimately familiar with the current csbg act, how it has helped individuals and communities in all corners of the nation and how it can be improved upon. we are excited that the csbg modernization act is moving forward and has such strong bipartisan support with more than 125 cosponsors from more than 25 states and the district of columbia. we are incredibly grateful for such a strong showing of support for csbg. i am writing to you today not simply out of gratitude but also to express our support for the csbg modernization act (hr 5129). the act changes the eligibility criterion from 125% of the federal poverty level (fpl) to 200% of the fpl, enabling the funding to reach more households in need, especially as we recover from the nationwide impact of covid- 19. important language is also included in the act that provides for the ongoing eligibility of clients so that they do not lose assistance as they work toward achieving their goal. this is critical to households' ability to exit poverty meaningfully and sustainably. the state offices that are responsible for overseeing this funding and ensuring it is thoughtfully spent fully and enthusiastically support these changes in csbg. while our network is excited for and supportive of the aforementioned language, we also have a few concerns and must note our primary concern below. as partners in the work of csbg, state offices carry a great deal of responsibility. states provide oversight of csbg funds via monitoring, contract management, policy development, and evaluation of results. as state offices fill these various roles, we recognize that there are aspects of the csbg modernization act of 2021 that could be refined to support the efficient and effective implementation of csbg at the state and local levels. we recommend revising grant obligational requirements in section 679 to `date of obligation' and removing language that refers to `available for expenditure' as it creates an unrealistic requirement on state offices to release funding in extremely short periods of time (30 days). we recommend focusing on continuous funding to eligible entities over prescriptive timelines (sec. 679(a)(2)(a) and sec. 679(a)(2)(a)(i)). we believe this addresses concerns about any gaps in funding while simultaneously acknowledging that each state has its own policies, procedures and regulations that dictate how funding is distributed from the federal to local level. we are deeply committed to the success of the csbg and know just what a difference it makes in communities across the country. it is through the cooperation of all stakeholders, from the federal level to eligible entities and, of course, state offices, that make the great work of csbg possible, and as such we want to be sure that the modernization act enables all to be successful partners. thank you for your support of csbg and considering our suggestions for improvements. sincerely, jeannie chaffin, interim executive director, nascsp. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, today i stand in opposition to h.r. 5129, the community services block grant modernization act of 2022, csbg. while i recognize that the csbg program has been serving those in need for decades, i do not believe that this reauthorization bill improves csbg services or fixes the program's flaws. as members of congress, we have an obligation to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent as efficiently and effectively as possible. in that regard, the csbg program is missing the mark. spending $1 billion on a program that has limited accountability is yet another reason why our country is experiencing the biggest inflation crisis we have seen in 41 years. with our national debt exceeding $30 trillion, it is time to stop mortgaging the future of the next generation with spending on programs that may not even work. there is little proof that csbg programs are accomplishing the one goal they were created for: moving americans out of poverty. in fact, there is more proof that csbg has become nothing but another welfare program, which keeps americans in poverty instead of lifting them into self-sufficiency. under current law, csbg lets states set their own benchmarks for progress, allowing ineffective programs to continue receiving taxpayer dollars despite poor performance. this bill continues that ineffective policy rather than creating commonsense measures to judge the programs' outcomes. this does not help people in need, and it is an irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars. when creating programs like csbg, our goal should be self- sufficiency, not government dependence. this is particularly true with some of the changes proposed in h.r. 5129. for example, the bill raises the income threshold for individuals who can receive services under csbg programs from 125 percent of the federal poverty level to 200 percent. in addition, it will allow individuals in the program to continue receiving services even after they have exceeded the income threshold. this program was created to help individuals most in need, but democrats are trying to twist it into a permanent welfare pipeline. h.r. 5129 has other troubling provisions. under this bill, organizations would be able to use grantee facilities for voter registration activities. while promoting political participation is important, it is simply not the purpose of this program. this new provision risks distracting servicers from their primary purpose and opening the door to partisan politics. we must preserve the integrity of csbg by keeping in place important safeguards that protect against intertwining federal policy and partisan political activity. this legislation also adds a new requirement that will allow csbg funds to be used for vague, undefined ``healthcare needs.'' with democrats' increasingly radical stance on abortion and attempts to strip the hyde amendment from federal legislation, this legislation could open the door for taxpayer-funded abortions and gender transitions. this is an unacceptable risk. lastly, one of the most concerning points of this bill is how it got protections for faith-based organizations. religious workers have been on the front lines serving the poor long before this program began. instead of honoring their long history of service, this bill would require religious organizations to check their faith at the door to participate in the csbg program. faith-based providers deserve an equal opportunity to serve those in need. our founding fathers wrote the first amendment to protect the free exercise of religion from interference by the federal government. yet, this bill suggests that faith-based organizations should not be able to hire employees who share the same faith if they are going to participate in a federal program. this is unacceptable. the constitution protects the right of religious organizations to hire in accordance with their beliefs. congress recognized this right in enacting title vii of the civil rights act of 1964. the supreme court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of a religious employer's staffing exemption in 1987. the current law protections, which were adopted in a bipartisan manner nearly 25 years ago, should be uncontroversial, but h.r. 5129 makes these provisions controversial because democrats think religious belief is backward and discriminatory. {time} 0930 democrats have claimed that these current law protections allow faith-based providers to discriminate against program beneficiaries. but that simply is not true. democrats cannot point to a single instance of widespread discrimination in the csbg program. these faith-based organizations exist to serve the neediest among us. the current law protections ensure they can continue to do that. if the purpose of h.r. 5129 was to improve csbg, then i am afraid the bill has failed miserably. this modernization attempt is a false start. [[page h4937]] madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. scott), who is the chairman of the education and labor committee. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership on this legislation. today the committee action agencies, or caas, form a network of more than 1,000 organizations that meet the unique needs of communities to help lift low-income individuals and families out of poverty. for decades community action agencies have been central pillars to our communities. they administer programs such as head start, to provide quality early childhood education for low-income children and support their families; meals on wheels, to support seniors experiencing hunger and isolation; and liheap, the low income home energy assistance program that helps people keep up with their utilities. in fact, it is the only federal program whose broad mission is to address poverty conditions and allow community action agencies to tailor services for low-income individuals in their communities, and they do this with the goal of giving a hand up, not a handout. community action agencies' work is made possible by the community services block grant, the csbg. unfortunately, the csbg program has not been reauthorized since 1998 creating uncertainty in the program. the bipartisan community services block grant modernization act of 2022 reauthorizes csbg for 10 years, the longest period in history, and improves the statute to help caas expand their work and reduce poverty across the country. this includes increased authorization levels and raising the csbg program income eligibility thresholds to expand access to their services. this will put csbg on solid footing so that the program continues to meet the complex and changing needs of low-income individuals and communities without changing local control to this important program. i thank the gentlewoman from oregon (ms. bonamici), the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. thompson), the gentlewoman from minnesota (ms. mccollum), the gentlewoman from new york (ms. stefanik), the gentleman from california (mr. desaulnier), and the gentleman from kentucky (mr. comer) for championing this bipartisan legislation. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support the legislation. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana (mr. banks). mr. banks. madam speaker, i thank the ranking member for her leadership. today i stand in opposition to h.r. 5129 because it removes longstanding religious protections for community service providers that receive funds through the community service block grant program. religious providers all around the country provide food for the hungry, healthcare and hospice programs for the terminally ill, and educational opportunities for the less fortunate. this partisan bill will likely prevent certain religious groups from engaging in charity, simply because of what motivates their charity. in 2019, the community action agencies partnered with more than 19,000 faith-based organizations around the country. in indiana, the funds reached 335,000 hoosiers by providing health services, housing aid, education help, income improvement, and more. if charitable choice language is removed from this bill, religious organizations may be forced to choose between serving their community and honoring their sincerely held faith beliefs. that means more hoosiers in need. it is shameful to cut religious protections from such an impactful program. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to oppose the bill as it will mean less charity tomorrow for all americans. we must defend our religious freedom, and this bill is a direct attack on it. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from new mexico (ms. leger fernandez), who is a member of education and labor committee. ms. leger fernandez. madam speaker, last week, i was approached by larry martinez who was there when the community service block grants first started in new mexico. he told me that my late father worked tirelessly to secure funds so the state of new mexico could match this new program. he called my late father the conscience of the senate. my father knew that these funds would make a real impact in the lives of new mexicans, and he was right. it has made a difference. the benefits are undeniable. instead of a family shivering in the cold in northern new mexico, we have families using liheap to keep their children warm. instead of a family being turned out of their home because they could not afford rising rent, csbg provides rental assistance. instead of a promising young man falling into homelessness or despair without an income, we have csbg programs helping with career training and job searches. one of my favorite programs is head start. i started my academic career as a head start baby and fell in love with learning, and we know that an investment in our children at the earliest age is the biggest and best investment we can work; and this provides head start. csbg touches every aspect of our community because there is not one root cause of poverty. we need to uplift our most vulnerable by meeting them where they are because they have aspirations that we need to help them achieve. the communities services block grant modernization act would strengthen csbg by increasing its authorization for annual appropriations. the bill would allow the community action network to serve more people by increasing the income eligibility for services. we should not kick people off a cliff back into poverty when they can rise into the working middle class. these are changes that will strengthen csbg and strengthen our communities. we must be the conscience of our communities in the house. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. allen). mr. allen. madam speaker, i thank the ranking member for her work on this important legislation. in fact, you cannot miss it. above our flag here have the words ``in god we trust.'' really? our nation's founders rightly recognized that every human being has a natural right to religious liberty. this right is so important that, like i said, it is enshrined as the first amendment to our constitution. when language was added to the csbg program in 1998 to protect the religious character of faith-based organizations, congress rightly recognized the importance of this fundamental right to religious liberty and the value that religious organizations add to our society. we need to stand by these principles today. unfortunately, democrats do not believe it is important to respect the religious freedom of faith-based organizations to hire according to their religious beliefs or to display religious symbols like a bible or the star of david while serving low-income americans through the csbg program. the democrats' removal of this important language--language that has been in the law for over two decades without causing harm to anyone--shines a spotlight on their intolerance of different viewpoints and beliefs. my colleague from michigan offered an amendment that would have taken the important and commonsense step to reinstate this longstanding language making clear that faith-based providers should be able to live out their faith while participating in the csbg program. i was very disappointed that democrats rejected this amendment during markup and refused to allow a floor vote on it. all we are asking is that the deeply held religious beliefs of faith- based organizations continue to be accommodated under the law. this approach allows many different viewpoints to exist alongside one another in our diverse country, and it makes sure that faith-based organizations can continue to do the work they do so well, and that is, help low-income americans. madam speaker, faith-based organizations are important partners to provide vital services, and for this reason i oppose this bill. [[page h4938]] ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield 3 minutes to gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. thompson), who is a member of the education and labor committee and a lead cosponsor of the legislation. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. madam speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding. today, we have the great opportunity to move one step closer to reducing poverty across the nation. the community services block grant is the only federal program with the explicit and overreaching goal of reducing poverty regardless of its cause. originally, created in 1964, the program established local community action agencies to help identify why people were in poverty and how to address it using public and private resources. it was a public-private partnership. community action agencies are governed by boards that are largely made up of business and industry community leaders in those counties. funds for this program help families and individuals achieve self- sufficiency, find and retain meaningful employment, attain an education, make better use of available income, obtain housing, and achieve greater participation in community affairs. virtually every county in the united states has a community action agency which helps low-income individuals and families move from poverty to independence. csbg has not been reauthorized in more than two decades, and today's vote will renew our commitment to reducing poverty and strengthening communities across the country. h.r. 5129 reauthorizes the community services block grant program for 10 years at an annual level of $1 billion for the first 5 years. it maintains local control of community action planning and activities. it is largely business and industry leaders that constitute those boards. it authorizes a broadband navigator program to respond to the broadband and digital needs of low-income families and communities to find pathways out of poverty. madam speaker, it does so much more. csbg requires some modernization to allow agencies the ability to tap their full potential and better serve families and communities. while this program has a strong history of bipartisan support, some of my colleagues have alleged faith-based organizations will no longer be able to participate in the csbg program if this bill becomes law. this is simply untrue. faith-based organizations are longstanding and essential partners in community action networks. they serve as incredible forces of good in their communities. philippians 2:4 tells us, ``let each of you look not only to his interests, but also to the interests of the others.'' madam speaker, as a man of faith and longtime member of the congressional prayer caucus, the last thing i would do is support legislation that removes faith-based organizations entirely from actively and equally participating in csbg. there have been longstanding federal regulations which were expanded under the george w. bush administration that allow faith-based organizations to partake in federal programs without compromising their religious beliefs. these regulations now apply to nine federal departments and agencies, including hhs. the trump administration also reaffirmed these regulations through the final rule titled equal participation of faith-based organizations in the federal agencies' programs and activities. this bill makes federal policy clearer, and it maintains the same protections for faith-based providers in csbg-funded activities. madam speaker, it is time for congress to reaffirm our nation's commitment to reducing poverty by reauthorizing the csbg, and i urge my colleagues to support the passage of this righteous legislation. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. walberg). mr. walberg. madam speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding. madam speaker, at the appropriate time i will offer an amendment to recommit h.r. 5129 and ask to have my amendment to restore current law protections for faith-based organizations included in the record. madam speaker, religious liberty is foundational to america. it is enshrined as the first amendment to our constitution. given this nation's dedication to religious liberty, it is so appalling that h.r. 5129 strikes current law protections for faith-based organizations that participate in the csbg program. faith-based providers have a history of leading america's fight to help those in need. from the salvation army to catholic charities, religious organizations formed the front line in assisting people in poverty. they did so not out of a desire for selfish gain or recognition but because they truly believe it is a calling. {time} 0945 that faith allows them to help those in need in unique ways that the government cannot. but instead of honoring these organizations for their long history of service, this bill suggests that religious organizations should leave their faith behind when they want to serve those in need. this is ridiculous. more than that, it is un-american. i would also argue it directly contradicts our constitution. madam speaker, we must give faith-based organizations and providers the same opportunity to serve low-income americans through the csbg program that we would give any other organization. we must also guarantee faith-based providers' rights to live out and express their faith through their work. i include in the record a letter from a coalition of religious providers, led by the institutional religious freedom alliance, which discusses the importance of maintaining current law protections for faith-based organizations--protections, i might add, that president biden himself supported when he was a member of the senate. may 10, 2022. house of representatives, washington, dc. dear representative: as leaders of faith-based service organizations, religious freedom advocates, and people of faith, we strongly implore you and your colleagues to retain the charitable choice provisions when reauthorizing the community services block grant [csbg]. the current language of h.r. 5129, the community services block grant modernization act of 2021, would replace the detailed charitable choice provisions with a bare sentence. this would be a negative change that creates a harmful precedent. we ask the house instead to reaffirm charitable choice in the csbg program by retaining the charitable choice provisions currently in the csbg statute. the charitable choice provisions (42 u.s. code 9920) give faith-based organizations an equal opportunity to compete for csbg funding and safeguard their religious character while also protecting beneficiary rights by prohibiting the use of csbg grant funds for explicitly religious activities. the presence of this detailed language in the statute is a billboard announcing a welcome for faith-based organizations to compete for funding. the provisions were added to the csbg program in 1998 in a reauthorization bill co-sponsored by republican senators dan coats (in) and jim jeffords (vt) and democratic senators ted kennedy (ma) and christopher dodd (ct). they sought to improve the effectiveness of csbg spending by prohibiting local governments and community action agencies [caas] from marginalizing faith-based organizations. protecting participation in csbg funding by faith-based providers and houses of worship ensures that the procurement process is competitive and that caas utilize the most effective and accountable service providers. the charitable choice provisions extend to faith-based organizations no novel or unconstitutional rights. its principles are codified in the equal treatment regulations that apply to department of health and human services funding programs (45 cfr 87), but only partially to csbg. csbg has its own regulations, similar but distinct. if charitable choice is taken out of the csbg statute, caas would have no guarantee that they will be afforded the same rights and protections due to other faith-based organizations under the equal treatment regulations. it would be better to retain the csbg statutory language and the accompanying regulations. statutory language provides more certainty over time to community action agencies and to faith-based organizations interested in partnering with them in service. some in the caa movement claim that the charitable choice language is dispensable because, despite its presence, few faith-based organizations receive csbg funding. if participation is truly low, then the remedy is action by congress and the office of community services in hhs to remove the non-statutory barriers that inhibit more extensive partnerships, not to remove the protections that enable the participation of those few. [[page h4939]] the addition of charitable choice in 1998 to the csbg program was the second time that congress and the clinton administration added such language to a federal program (charitable choice was first added to the tanf program in 1996). these actions launched the faith-based or partnership initiative. the four succeeding administrations of both parties (bush, obama, trump, and biden) have worked with energy to ensure that federal social programs are maximally effective because they partner with the best non-government organizations, including faith-based organizations, with full protection for the religious freedom of the ultimate beneficiaries. senators coats, jeffords, kennedy, and dodd were right to add charitable choice to the csbg program. removing it will be detrimental to the participation of faith-based organizations, when it is their greater involvement that will most benefit the communities that csbg funding is intended to serve. removing it will create a terrible precedent by signaling that congress is no longer as boldly committed to equal opportunity for service organizations of every faith or none. we ask the house to reaffirm charitable choice in the csbg program by amending h.r. 5129 to restore this language before the reauthorization moves forward. thank you for your consideration of this important matter. signed, [university

among us. unfortunately, my democrat colleagues rejected this commonsense amendment. i was further disappointed when they did not make my amendment in order for floor consideration. this is a forthright attack on religious liberty by the democrats, and we cannot stand for it. madam speaker, if we adopt this motion to recommit, we will instruct the committee on education and labor to reconsider my amendment to restore these current law provisions. madam speaker, i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this amendment in the record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to recommit. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from michigan? there was no objection. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, how much time is remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentlewoman from oregon has 18 minutes remaining. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield myself 3 minutes. madam speaker, we all agree that the inclusion of faith-based organizations and faith leaders is important for the community action network. in fact, they have a long history of being involved with community action since the very beginning of the war on poverty in the 1960s, and i have no doubt that they will continue to do their important work. in recent years, the supreme court has made clear that religious entities cannot be excluded from participation in publicly funded programs because of their religious status. this legislation, despite what the ranking member and others claim, would not change that. we are here today to reauthorize and modernize the community services block grant program, which is almost 20 years past its authorization expiration. i also note that the bipartisan bill introduced in the previous congress, the 116th, also removed the charitable choice provision with broad bipartisan support, and h.r. 5129 reflects the same sensible compromise on this issue. in fact, some members would have liked the legislation to go further to expressly address other nondiscrimination issues, but i did not take that approach as we crafted the bill because i wanted to maintain the bipartisan agreement we reached to make real progress toward the much- needed reauthorization of csbg. twenty years is too long for this program, our community action agencies, and the communities they serve. it is too long for them to wait for us to reach an agreement, and we have reached an agreement. additionally, madam speaker, for 60 years, community action agencies have had relationships with faith-based organizations. the involvement of faith-based organizations in community action programs long predates the charitable choice provision, and their involvement will continue without this controversial provision. we also know that hhs regulations have existed for nearly 20 years incorporating many of the same principles. eliminating the duplicative charitable choice provision in csbg allows us to move forward with a reauthorization that is vital to so many of our agencies [[page h4940]] and allows hhs to apply a single set of rules across programs. this is a distraction that should not prevent us from moving forward with this reauthorization and maintaining the bipartisan consensus we have achieved. madam speaker, i include in the record a letter from the coalition against religious discrimination, a broad and diverse group of leading religious, civil rights, labor, and health organizations supporting the removal of the charitable choice provision from the community services block grant program. the coalition against religious discrimination, may 11, 2022. dear representative: as members and allies of the coalition against religious discrimination (card), we write to support the changes in h.r. 5129, the community services block grant (csbg) modernization act of 2022, that would remove charitable choice, a highly controversial policy. card is a broad and diverse group of leading religious, civil rights, labor, and health organizations that formed in the 1990s to oppose adding charitable choice to social service program authorizations. since then, card has continued to advocate for strengthening the constitutional and legal safeguards that apply to such partnerships in this and other social service programs. we appreciate the important role that religiously affiliated organizations historically have played in addressing many of our nation's most pressing social needs, including in some cases, with the use of government funds; indeed, many members of card know this firsthand. we also recognize that the separation of church and state is the cornerstone of religious freedom. contrary to claims of its supporters, charitable choice provisions did not remove any ``barriers'' to participation for faith-based providers. faith-based organizations partnered with the government to provide services long before the addition of charitable choice to the community services block grant programs. charitable choice instead changed the rules. but faith-based organizations should follow the same rules as all other providers, and effective government collaboration with faith-based entities does not require government-supported discrimination. charitable choice removed traditional church-state safeguards that applied to social service providers that accept taxpayer funds. it allows taxpayer-funded faith-based organizations to discriminate in hiring, including by undermining state and local nondiscrimination protections, and threatens the rights of beneficiaries when delivering services. people in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections. and no one should be forced to choose between conforming to a religious litmus test or losing a government-funded job. charitable choice does not protect religious freedom, rather it uses the guise of religious freedom to justify discrimination against employees and put people who need government services at risk of harm. thus, we support the removal of the charitable choice provisions from the csbg authorization. sincerely, adl (anti-defamation league), african american ministers in action, american atheists, american civil liberties union, american federation of teachers, american humanist

gentlewoman for yielding. the chair of the subcommittee has said a lot about the charitable choice provision and the fact that faith-based entities have long participated in community action programs from the very beginning in the 1960s, and there is no evidence that they will stop participating. charitable choice purports to advance religious freedom, ensuring participation of faith-based organizations. the fact is, they are going to participate. some may not because they cannot operate without discriminating. well, that is their right. but if you are going to take federal money, you should not discriminate. this language that is being offered, the language that is not in the bill, authorizes broad religious discrimination against employees and fails to adequately protect religious liberty rights of beneficiaries in taxpayer-funded social services. now, when a church runs a program, they can hire whoever they want based on religion with church money. but when you take federal money, there ought to be equal opportunity in hiring. so, the charitable choice language, which is not in the bill as it is, requires equal opportunity, so if you apply for a job, you will not be discriminated against. unfortunately, this charitable choice thing kind of redefines the victim of discrimination. when somebody applies for a job under charitable choice and is told, ``we do not hire your kind because you are the wrong religion,'' we have redefined the victim in that as the agency discriminating because if we do not let them discriminate, we are violating their religious liberty. what about the person who applied for the job? they have been denied a job solely on the basis of religion. it is my view that that is the one who needs the protection. we do not need to protect the right to discriminate. in fact, that is why a broad coalition of civil rights, labor, and health organizations supports the removal of the language that allows that kind of discrimination, and that is in the letter that the chairwoman has offered. that letter says, in part: ``charitable choice does not protect religious freedom; rather, it uses the guise of religious freedom to justify discrimination against employees and put people who need government services at risk.'' i think it is time that this language be removed, as this bill before us does, so that the real victims of discrimination who are being discriminated against can get the protection of the federal government as they have since the 1964 civil rights bill. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, if csbg programs were fulfilling their statutory purpose, we would be hearing lots of numbers of people lifted out of poverty. but those numbers have been notably absent in the committee debate and here today. we have been given no proof, no proof at all, that these programs are working as they have been set up. we are asking hardworking taxpayers-- let me repeat that--hardworking taxpayers to give money to support these programs that have no accountability. the goal is to take people out of poverty and have them become hardworking taxpayers to balance out the burden here in this country, but that is not happening, madam speaker. this bill would appropriate $1 billion. i said in my opening comments that we are $30 trillion in debt. we are going to add to our debt with this program with no accountability. we should not spend a dime of taxpayer dollars without knowing that those dollars are being spent effectively. republicans support commonsense efforts to fight poverty and provide a safety net for americans truly in need. we want to make our nation's antipoverty programs the best they can be, a streamlined network that specifically focuses on aiding those in dire need and helps lift them out of poverty, but that is not what we have here. h.r. 5129 fails to reform csbg. in fact, the program widely expands the pool of eligible beneficiaries, leaving those most in need with fewer resources. it goes along with other programs that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the biden administration keep proposing, and that is to put more people in dependency in this country, not make them independent. it also attacks religious liberty. i believe my colleagues have basically admitted that in the last few minutes. [[page h4941]] over 19,000 vital faith-based organizations work tirelessly to help their communities through the csbg program. yet, h.r. 5129 sets a terrible and destructive precedent. preventing faith-based organizations from competing for grants while remaining true to their religious character means fewer low-income americans will receive the help they need. this legislation is another washington-knows-best approach that will keep americans dependent on hardworking taxpayers' dollars. my colleagues should reject this legislation, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, i include in the record a statement of administration policy from the executive office of the president supporting h.r. 5129 and praising the legislation's commitment to ensuring that communities have the tools they need to address poverty and achieve economic mobility. statement of administration policy h.r. 5129--community services block grant modernization act of 2022-- rep. bonamici, d-or, and 126 cosponsors the administration supports the poverty-fighting goals of h.r. 5129, the community services block grant modernization act of 2022, to provide states, territories, and tribes with resources for critical community services. this legislation will reauthorize the community services block grant (csbg) for a decade and help ensure that communities have the tools they need to fight poverty and build economic mobility. the csbg has been supporting tribal and local governments and community organizations across the country for over 50 years with funding to help them serve low-income individuals and families. local administration of some of the most essential community programs--such as job training and placement, food and nutrition assistance, head start, housing and homelessness assistance, and the low income home energy assistance program--is supported by csbg funds. while these services and strategies have always been key to helping americans get ahead and stay ahead, the covid-19 pandemic underscored just how vital it is to invest in the organizations that deliver them. faced with unprecedented demand and the operational challenges of the pandemic, the more than 1,000 organizations supported by csbg continued working to help low-income communities address housing and food insecurity, provide high-quality early childhood education, and support individuals re-entering the workforce. now, as this administration works to build a strong and equitable recovery, it is more important than ever to invest in locally based solutions to the causes and conditions of poverty in communities. the csbg update proposed by this act would result in greater equity for tribes, expanded income eligibility data modernization, strengthened performance management, and support for community-based services and strategies. in addition, this act would support new broadband navigator efforts and continues critical support for community economic development and rural development activities. and reauthorizing csbg for the first time since 1998 would provide organizations and the millions of families they serve with the confidence and stability to make the long-term investments communities need. the administration looks forward to working with congress to ensure that this bipartisan legislation achieves its purposes, continues expanding opportunity for all americans, and ultimately is enacted. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i thank representative mccollum for supporting h.r. 5129. i am thankful for her leadership in the 116th congress' legislation to reauthorize csbg and her continued strong support for this program. madam speaker, i also include in the record letters from various organizations, individuals, and localities supporting this bipartisan legislation to reauthorize this community services block grant. loa, roanoke, va, april 19, 2022. hon.

csbg allocation being distributed to local community action agencies (caas), our communities rely upon this unique flexible funding. caas, like tap, use the funds to combat poverty and promote self-sufficiency, respond rapidly to unforeseen crises such as natural disasters and the covid-19 pandemic and implement gap-filling activities that address unmet community needs. additionally, caas use csbg to organize and support other local charities and community- based initiatives, ensuring services are streamlined and not duplicative. without csbg, every single community in america would be hurt. your bill would codify critical updates to the program. it provides security and reliability to communities across the country by authorizing csbg for 10 years and ensuring money flows in a timely manner. the crucial modernizations included in h.r. 5129, such as the new broadband navigator initiative, will increase caas' ability to respond to emerging needs. we are also pleased to see the emphasis on quality performance at the federal, state, and local level and that the essential nature of csbg as a locally-controlled program is retained and bolstered. because of h.r. 5129's local

sr., mayor. patricia white-boyd, vice-mayor. william bestpitch, council member. vivian sanchez-jones, council member. joseph cobb, council member. stephanie moon reynolds, council member. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, millions of families and individuals across our country benefit from the locally driven antipoverty programs and services backed by the community services block grant program. we are here today to make sure it continues to meet their needs and the unique needs of our communities. i am pleased that the house is taking up this long-overdue update to the community services block grant program with strong bipartisan support. csbg enables community action agencies to be innovative, leverage public and private resources for their communities, and cost- efficiently administer many programs, including head start, liheap, nutrition assistance, weatherization, job training, housing, and assistance for those experiencing homelessness. this bipartisan legislation will strengthen funding for community action agencies, raise the csbg program's income eligibility threshold to expand its important services; promote innovation in the caa network through a federally administered community action innovations program; and, importantly, modernizes accountability, which is an important part of the bill, and performance standards. the bottom line is that this legislation will better help low-income individuals and families achieve economic stability and access housing, childcare, utility assistance, employment, and other services. i, once again, urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan bill to renew our nation's commitment to reducing poverty through community action, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. mccollum. madam speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 5129, the community services block grant modernization act of 2022. this legislation renews the nation's commitment to reducing poverty through an established network of more than 1,000 local community action agencies. having authored previous iterations of this legislation, and now being an original cosponsor with my good friend congresswoman bonamici, i could not be more excited to advance this bill today. at a time when it seems like congress cannot agree on anything, i am glad that we can show people that there are still issues that bring democrats and republicans together. and that is exactly what csbg has been doing for more than 50 years--bringing americans together. for years, these agencies have served as incredible resources to help low-income families escape poverty and better their surrounding communities. these agencies served on the front lines against covid-19, helping millions of americans get through the pandemic. just this past week, i visited the community action partnership of ramsey and washington counties where i saw first-hand the amazing work these people do for my constituents. h.r. 5129 builds on this success by reinforcing existing efforts to improve the performance and management of community action at the federal, state, and local levels. i would like to thank my friends congresswoman bonamici and congressman glenn thompson for advancing this essential legislation. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. mr. sablan. madam speaker, h.r. 5129, the community services block grant modernization act, improves and expands access to the only federal program with the overarching goal of reducing poverty, regardless of cause or condition. since congress established the predecessor of the community services block grant (csbg) as part of president lyndon b. johnson's ``war on poverty,'' the program has helped people achieve economic stability, secure meaningful employment and education, gain and improve job-related skills, and obtain housing. such support is particularly crucial for communities in the northern mariana islands, the u.s. virgin islands, guam, and american samoa-- where poverty rates are significantly higher than in the rest of america. in the marianas, 52.3 percent of the population is considered low-income, according to census data. the community services block grant modernization act helps alleviate such poverty by increasing overall funding for the program, updating eligibility guidelines, and eliminating the arbitrary grant allocations to the insular areas. h.r. 5129 provides an increased annual funding level of $1 billion for the first five years. the bill also permanently raises income eligibility to 200 percent of the poverty line, as temporarily provided in the cares act, so more people can get the help they need. to better align funding allocations to the insular areas to meet its anti-poverty mission, the community services block grant modernization act mandates a data-based formula and transparency in how that formula is calculated. under current law, the secretary of health and human services possesses total discretion to allocate csbg funding based on what he or she ``believes'' the need is in each insular area. this changes under h.r. 5129. language i included in the bill during the education and labor committee's markup requires the secretary to base its grant allocations on the most recent census poverty data available. that allocation formula must be published publicly and updated no less frequently than any time new applicable census data are available. using a regularly updated, poverty-based formula will help ensure communities receive the support necessary to serve individuals and families in need. at a time when communities nationwide continue to be impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, the improvements to the csbg program under h.r. 5129 will increase help for the most vulnerable in our communities. {time} 1000 the speaker pro tempore. all time for debate has expired. each further amendment printed in part f of house report 117-320 not earlier considered as part of amendments en bloc

strengthen the underlying bill. i thank my colleagues for their contributions. i strongly urge support of the amendments en bloc and the underlying bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i rise in opposition to the amendment. madam speaker, while the amendments before us include some positive reforms to improve accountability and transparency in the community services block grant program, there are unfortunately several problematic amendments in the mix that outweigh the improvements and require me to oppose them when considered together. these amendments are duplicative, add additional requirements to the program, and lessen accountability. it is critical to streamline antipoverty programs to make them work for low-income americans. but instead, these amendments layer on duplication and move us in the opposite direction. i cannot agree to add more inefficiency to an already ineffective program, and therefore, cannot support the democrat amendments before us today. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from nevada (mr. horsford). mr. horsford. madam speaker, i rise today in support of my amendment, which will ensure we address the impacts health inequities have on creating and exacerbating poverty within our communities. as my constituents and far too many americans know, unequal access to quality healthcare can be financially crushing. whether an individual is too sick to work and cannot receive adequate care or the care they received was very expensive and inadequate, we know health inequity is a root cause of poverty in nevada and across the country. we cannot combat poverty without recognizing the role that health inequities play to perpetuate the cycle of poverty. through my work coleading the ways and means committee's racial equity initiative, i have seen firsthand just how valuable data can be when we are examining disparities. in our healthcare system, the data speaks for itself. in my state of nevada, african americans and latinos are twice as likely as their white counterparts to develop asthma. this and other chronic illnesses exacerbate disparities due to their inherently pervasive nature. to combat this, i urge my colleagues to support my amendment and the csbg modernization act in a bipartisan manner. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from pennsylvania (ms. houlahan). ms. houlahan. madam speaker, i rise today in support of my amendment that ensures that states and other eligible entities under the community services block grant modernization act of 2022 can utilize funds for behavioral health purposes. these past 2 years have had a devastating effect on the physical and mental health of people across the nation, especially those who live in poverty or in under-resourced areas. in my district, we have seen hospitals shuttered, families suffer, and young people facing unprecedented mental health challenges. by adding explicit language on behavioral health to this bill, we underscore the heightened need for increased resources to reach those that are underserved and most at risk. thankfully, recipients like my home state of pennsylvania are already receiving funding through this grant program to alleviate the causes of poverty and provide opportunities for employment. but the community services block grant program must emphasize that in order for states to truly attack the root causes of poverty, they must address the rising rate of mental illness and substance abuse disorders. just yesterday, the cdc announced that there were more than 100,000 drug overdoses in 2021, a record high, and a 15 percent increase from 2020. this data shows that something must change. we all know that for people to participate meaningfully in the workforce and to achieve self-sufficiency, they need the tools, first and foremost, to address their physical, mental, and behavioral health. as a prior businessowner, i understand the importance of this firsthand, because america thrives when our workers thrive. community services block grants have been successful in supporting those who are most underserved across our communities for decades. let us, please, build on this mission and ensure that the program meets the needs of our diverse 21st century communities and workers. i ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from connecticut (mrs. hayes), a member of the committee on education and labor. mrs. hayes. madam speaker, i rise to offer an amendment to protect communities from malicious scams surrounding the community services block grant program. the csbg program is absolutely critical to the empowerment of vulnerable communities. funding from the csbg program has helped nine community action agencies in my state serve 107,000 families and 260,000 individuals. it has helped over 81,000 households avoid crisis with energy assistance and nearly 17,000 people avoid hunger with emergency or supplemental food and enrolled 5,600 children in early childcare services. additionally, these agencies have helped nearly 11,000 people file their income taxes, returning $8.5 million to my state's economy. csbg programs empower our communities' most vulnerable, which is why they are always offered free of charge. however, scammers across the country falsely purport to offer csbg services for a fee, preying on those in our community when they are most in need of help. we have seen a proliferation of fraud and scams throughout the covid-19 pandemic when emergency federal dollars were sent to states. these scams are illegal and morally reprehensible. it is our responsibility to ensure our communities are properly informed to combat predatory schemes. it is our responsibility to reinforce guardrails to protect the integrity of these programs and ensure they fulfill their promises to our communities. my amendment would require that states provide easily accessible warnings about verified scams as well as information on where to seek recourse should someone believe they are the victim of a csbg-related scam. making this information available will ensure that csbg can continue to provide lifesaving services to communities without being subject to greed and mal-intent. this is a simple, commonsense amendment that the congressional budget office has certified as budget neutral. i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment and the underlying legislation. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, may i inquire how much time i have remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentlewoman from oregon has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. [[page h4945]] ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). ms. jackson lee. madam speaker, i thank the manager of the legislation and chairman of the committee for this important legislation. the community services block grant modernization act is extremely important. as we all know, this bipartisan bill will bring about an enhanced ability to serve the community. the csbg moneys are particularly important not only to rural areas but to urban areas. they are important as they relate to many issues, such as in my community dealing with overcoming disasters. those dollars are utilized to ensure housing. i include in the record an article entitled, ``black communities are last in line for disaster planning in texas'' and an article entitled, ``5 years after hurricane harvey, many in houston are still waiting for help.'' [from the washington post, may 12, 2022] black communities are last in line for disaster planning in texas houston.--lawrence hester worries every time it rains. during heavy storms, water overflows the dirt drainage ditch fronting his yard and the bayou at the end of his block--flooding the street, creeping up his front steps, pooling beneath the house, and trapping his family inside. ``we are always underwater here,'' said hester, 61. and yet, the state of texas allocated none of the $1 billion in federal funds it received to protect communities from future disasters to neighborhoods in houston that flood regularly, according to an investigation by the u.s. department of housing and urban development. hud has now found the exclusion of those majority black and hispanic urban communities to be discriminatory. the state ``shifted money away from the areas and people that needed it the most,'' disproportionately benefiting white residents living in smaller towns, the agency concluded. houston has faced seven federally declared disasters in the last seven years and suffered an estimated $2 billion in damage from hurricane harvey in 2017. that storm devastated kashmere gardens, where hester has lived his entire life. the floodwaters from harvey deposited black mold throughout hester's home and left his daughter chronically short of breath. the state, which is appealing hud's findings, denied discriminating, saying the texas general land office administered the federal grant program based on hud approval. the situation in texas illustrates the challenge facing the biden administration, which has pledged to focus on racial equity but is struggling to protect low-income communities of color from the growing threat of climate change. even after hud's finding of discrimination, the agency said it does not have the power at this time to suspend the rest of the $4.3 billion in disaster mitigation money awarded to the state under criteria approved by the trump administration. ``what is happening here with these federal dollars going through the state and not one dime coming to the city of houston post-hurricane harvey is absolutely crazy, and it cannot be justified,'' said houston mayor sylvester turner. ``what do i say to the people in kashmere gardens when these storms keep coming, and we are not putting in the infrastructure that they desperately need to mitigate the risk of future flooding?'' black and hispanic communities in northeast houston, including kashmere gardens, are especially vulnerable to the more frequent storms and catastrophic flooding expected due to climate change, according to the federal emergency management agency. many of the residential streets lack curbs and gutters--common storm drainage infrastructure in predominantly white neighborhoods in houston--and rely instead on open ditches dating back to the 1930s. ``sometimes we cannot get out because the water is so high,'' said jackie spradley, hester's wife. ``you are literally trapped until the water starts to subside.'' she cannot get to work. their 12-year-old daughter cannot get to school. the whoosh of traffic and trains permeates the triangular neighborhood of modest single-family homes penned between two highways and two sets of railroad tracks. during large storms, runoff from impervious highway surfaces flows onto residential streets. piles of trash--old tires, mattresses, furniture, home insulation--accumulate for weeks in the drainage ditches along many streets, blocking water from flowing through the ditches to the bayou. silt and other debris clog many of the culverts beneath narrow driveways and footpaths spanning the ditches. in the summers, standing water breeds mosquitoes. the city of houston had hoped to use $95 million in federal grants to upgrade kashmere gardens' storm drainage infrastructure. the proposed improvements, including converting some of the ditches to a curb and gutter system, would have removed the flood risk to nearly 1,400 properties. but without the money, the city shelved those plans. hester's daughter ashlei was 7 years old in 2017 when harvey floodwaters breached their family room, lapping at the legs of the card table on which the family played dominoes. her cough worsened, and doctors prescribed four different medications for asthma. she was hospitalized in 2018 for more than a week. but doctors still did not know what was causing her illness. it was not until december 2019, more than two years after harvey, when hester and his wife discovered the black mold that was making their daughter so sick. a city inspector recommended that the house be condemned. ``i was so ashamed,'' hester said. ``we did not have nowhere else to go.'' his mother had purchased the home in 1960, paying the mortgage with wages from her job flipping burgers 16 hours a day. hester was born in the house months later. he had stayed in the house after hurricane alicia flooded the home in 1983. and after ike in 2008. even after harvey, hester stayed, hoping to someday pass the three-bedroom ranch-style home onto his daughter. but hester, who is on disability for herniated disks in his back and neck from his years as a long-haul truck driver, and his wife, who sells insurance, never had the money to adequately repair the storm-ravaged roof and mold-covered walls. hester said the city informed him after harvey that he was ineligible for funding to fix the home because of unpaid property taxes. ``it is not just about the storm drainage,'' hester said. ``it is about everything.'' hester said that the rainbow-hued oily waters he had splashed in while playing in the drainage ditches as a child had been polluted with cancer-causing creosote used to treat wooden railroad ties and utility poles. a 2019 state health department investigation confirmed elevated cancer rates among residents in the southern end of kashmere gardens, located near two superfund sites. residents fear that flooding will carry toxic deposits into their yards. hester's mother had died of cancer. so had his father. and one of his brothers. ``cancer is killing the whole neighborhood,'' said hester, who is too afraid to visit the doctor about his own health problems. federal disaster mitigation grants are supposed to improve the inferior flood infrastructure in lower income communities. but the hud investigation found that competition rules set by the texas general land office unfairly favored smaller towns with less urgent needs and where residents are more likely to be white and less likely to be lower income. the state knowingly adopted scoring criteria that prioritized lower-density areas and excluded communities that hud designated as the most impacted by disasters from half the grants, hud said. ``because the criteria had these unjustified discriminatory effects, their use failed to comply with hud's regulations,'' the agency found. no other state adopted texas' method of distributing the funds, according to hud's office of fair housing and equal opportunity. the agency concluded that without texas's discriminatory criteria, nearly four times as many black residents and more than twice as many hispanic residents would have benefited from the grants. the general land office said in its april 1 appeal that the state ``does not discriminate, and the projects it has funded help minority beneficiaries across texas.'' the state said more than two-thirds of residents in communities that received awards are black, hispanic or asian. the state pointed out that its plan was approved two years ago and characterized hud's new objections as ``politically motivated.'' in addition to houston and surrounding harris county, the general land office denied grants to the predominantly black and hispanic cities of port arthur, beaumont and corpus christi as well as jefferson and nueces counties--all of which experienced significant flooding from harvey, according to the civil rights complaint. texas housers, a nonprofit focused on housing in low-income communities, and northeast action collective, a grassroots advocacy group of houston residents, filed the complaint with hud last year. instead, funds were steered toward inland, whiter communities that were far less severely impacted by hurricanes and used to fund routine infrastructure, the complaint said. that includes $17.5 million for a new community center in caldwell county that is supposed to double as an evacuation center; $10.8 million to install a sewage system in the 379-person town of iola; $6 million for a new sheriff's department radio tower and radios for gonzales county; and $4.2 million for a 2,000-foot-long road in bastrop county to connect a walmart parking lot and a home depot, justified as an alternate path for emergency vehicles in case the adjacent freeway is clogged with hurricane evacuees from the gulf coast 161 miles away. ``these mitigation funds are a strategy to undo the systemic racism of the past, but that is not what we are seeing texas interested in at all,'' said john henneberger, co- director of texas housers. ``this is a test of how serious hud and the biden administration are in enforcing civil rights.'' hud's office of community planning and development, which oversees disaster mitigation aid, wrote to the texas general land office in march expressing ``grave concerns'' over the distribution of the first round of [[page h4946]] grants. ``the state has not identified a plan to protect communities while guarding against competition criteria that could disadvantage minority residents,'' hud wrote. if a voluntary resolution cannot be reached, hud said it could refer the matter to the department of justice for enforcement. but advocates worry that could come too late for communities like kashmere gardens. while hud said it cannot stop the state from awarding the rest of the grants ``due to prior decisions,'' it would begin monitoring how the money is distributed and warned it could claw back the funds if necessary. ``texas has a history of sending money to those who are politically connected,'' said shannon van and, a professor of urban planning at texas a.m. university whose research focuses on hazard reduction and housing. she noted that racial disparities occurred with the distribution of disaster funds after hurricane ike in 2008. civil rights advocates say hud has the authority to suspend texas's ability to spend federal grant money; it has done so under previous administrations. but sara pratt, former deputy assistant secretary in hud's fair housing office who is now representing texas housers as an attorney, said there is longstanding division among hud staff over enforcing civil rights violations when making funding decisions. ``there is deep disagreement internally,'' pratt said. ``the secretary's job is to resolve disputes like this.'' hud secretary marcia l. fudge declined to comment because the texas investigation remains open, hud spokesman michael burns said. ``her commitment to civil rights and fair housing is well documented and unwavering, and she is committed to ensuring that all hud funds are used in compliance with all relevant laws and program requirements,'' burns said. in response to widespread criticism over how the first $1 billion in harvey disaster grants was distributed, texas now plans to allocate $750 million to harris county. houston is due to receive an additional $9 million out of $488 million that the state plans to send to the houston-galveston region. city officials point out that the $9 million amounts to less than one tenth of the cost of its proposed improvements to kashmere gardens. in kashmere gardens on a recent morning after a thunderstorm inundated streetside drainage ditches, bulldozers and dump trucks worked to widen and deepen hunting bayou to absorb runoff from future storms. the work is a small portion of a $2.5 billion flood protection bond that harris county passed in 2018. the bulk of the bond money was directed to wealthier neighborhoods because the county expected to receive federal disaster funds for poorer ones, according to county commissioner rodney ellis. but without money to upgrade the ditch system to drain storm water from neighborhood streets, it is unclear if the bayou expansion will be effective. ``this is the texas two-step in houston. you have to get the water from the neighborhoods to the bayous. and then you have to get the water from the bayous to the gulf of mexico,'' said ellis, who represents the area. residents, too, remain skeptical. ``it is a wait and see situation,'' said dorothy wanza, another kashmere gardens resident whose street turned into a river during harvey and flooded her home with more than a foot of water. the experience left the 80-year-old so traumatized that ``every time it rains, i get the hell out of dodge.'' she spent the previous night fully dressed, prepared to evacuate to one of her children's homes. ``the ditches overflow, and once they are full, the water comes back on you,'' wanza said. on the other side of the bayou, hester said the city had recently cleaned out part of a ditch lining his street for the first time he could recall in more than a decade. dirt and bricks still block some of the culverts. ``right up under there, look,'' he said, pointing beneath the concrete walkway leading from the street to his front yard. ``it is stopped up on both sides.'' he nodded farther down the street to another culvert: ``that whole drain hole was flooded.'' he and his next door neighbor had removed as many bricks as they could to move the water through. ``if we do not do things around here, am not nothing going to get done. i have to go around here and try to help, and i am in bad shape myself.'' hester limped around the perimeter of his home and pointed two feet up the siding where harvey floodwaters had reached-- a reminder of the catastrophe he says he failed to protect his daughter from. a nonprofit had removed the mold inside when it fixed up the house in 2020, installing new cabinets, a new roof and laminate flooring. but the entryway still slopes. the floor joists need to be repaired. the porch is lopsided, its wood rotted. hester is stooped from years of pain. yet he remains intent on doing what he can to make things right. ``it is not my life i am worried about. it is my daughter's,'' hester said. ``i am half dead.'' ____ [from grist, april 14, 2022] 5 years after hurricane harvey, many in houston are still waiting for help in billy guevara's neighborhood on the northeast side of houston, people get nervous when it rains. old ditches strain under the deluge of a gulf storm, and mud and water fill the streets. guevara, a writer who is blind, once had a seeing- eye dog that would navigate around the ankle-deep puddles and lingering muck. ``it became unsafe because i ended up having to walk almost in the middle of the street,'' he said. ``it stays there for days.'' guevara is a member of the northeast action collective, a community group pushing the city and harris county for equitable investments in flood control. he says drainage in his neighborhood of lakewood is outdated: ``it cannot handle the type of rain that we see now.'' when hurricane harvey hit in 2017, homes across many of northeast houston's black and hispanic neighborhoods flooded, swamped under 30 inches of rain in what was the country's costliest disaster that year. under the rush of water, one of the walls in guevara's home began to bulge out. years after harvey, little aid has made it to the people of houston. the federal government budgeted some $9.3 billion so that communities could not only rebuild, but also better prepare for the next storm. but city and regional governments have delivered little of those funds, and a state agency's ``competition'' has held back aid that the department of housing and urban development designated for post-harvey mitigation, money which would have helped upgrade drainage systems. as a result, low-income communities like guevara's have been left out of much-needed infrastructure improvements. without their fair share of aid, communities struggling to rebuild will be just as vulnerable when the next storm comes, advocates say. these obstacles also expose weaknesses in hud's recently created mitigation program, which aims to help reduce risks from future climate disasters. hurricane harvey flooded nearly 100,000 homes in houston, inflicting $16 billion in residential damage. guevara had growing mold, damaged floors, and a leaking pipe. with a small fema grant and the help of local nonprofits, he was eventually able to repair his home. but today, thousands in houston still wait for funds to rebuild. disaster recovery aid through hud often comes with significant delays since the program is ad hoc, requiring congress to approve spending for each disaster. in 2018, hud allocated $5 billion to texas through its community development block grant disaster recovery program, which is designed to help with long-term rebuilding. hud had sent the money to the texas general land office, or glo, the state agency run by george p. bush, grandson of former president george h. w. bush, which is responsible for public lands, mineral rights, and the alamo historical site, as well as disaster recovery. in turn, the state agency gave houston's share to the city, but did not entirely relinquish control, continuing to oversee how funds were doled out. the city and state agency squabbled over how to run things, and when hud began an audit of the program, the fight escalated, eventually making its way to the texas supreme court. in october 2020, the feud ended with the state seizing control of the program. all the while, many residents remained in dangerous living conditions, stuck in homes with leaking roofs and mold-filled walls, said becky selle, a codirector at the grassroots group west street recovery. it is unclear whether those waiting will ever get assistance. in january, when hud published its audit, only 297 of nearly 8,800 applicants had received funds. (the state has until august 2025 to use the money.) the struggle to access federal aid extended far beyond homeowner's assistance. harvey was among the first disasters for which hud's community development block grant disaster recovery program made money available for mitigation projects like widening bayous, upgrading water and sewer systems, or buying out flood-prone homes. this marked a major shift: while disaster recovery funds had to be tied to damage from a specific disaster, the $4.3 billion mitigation fund could be used to improve conditions, making communities safer. houston and harris county accounted for more than half of texas' damage from hurricane harvey, but when the glo released its spending plan in december 2019, city officials feared houston would not get its fair share. because there were not enough funds for every proposed project, the state's land office set up a competition in which jurisdictions would apply for a slice of the $1 billion in the initial round. hud identified 20 mainly coastal counties, including harris county, that were most distressed by hurricane harvey and would be eligible for funds. the land office then expanded the list, adding counties that fell under the umbrella of the original fema disaster declaration in 2017. that more than doubled the list with more rural, inland counties like milam, 200 miles from the coast. when results from the competition came out last may, houston did not get a cent. the city's requests for $470 million worth of projects, like flood control in the majority-black neighborhoods sunnyside and kashmere gardens, were rejected. so was the $200 million watershed improvement plan for the flood-prone halls bayou, which is surrounded by some of houston's poorest neighborhoods. ``for the state glo not to give one dime in the initial distribution to the city and a very small portion to harris county shows a callous disregard to the people of [[page h4947]] houston and harris county,'' houston mayor sylvester turner said in a state1nent at the time. instead, funds largely went to smaller, whiter, inland towns. they went to drainage upgrades in rockdale, a two-hour drive northwest of houston, and sewage improvements in nixon, a small town outside san antonio that emerged from harvey unscathed and sheltered evacuees fleeing the storm. ``the more that we are giving this money to inland counties and jurisdictions, we are actually taking away from where we truly need the money and where the money was originally intended to assist communities,'' said julia orduna, the southeast texas regional director at texas housers, a low- income housing group. after the snub, the city of houston hoped for a second chance when the houston-galveston area council, a regional council spanning 13 counties, planned to deal out its own pool of the funds. but in february, the council granted just 2 percent of its $488 million to the city, which represents around 30 percent of the council's population. according to the council, houston and harris county did not need much more than that because the glo planned to grant the county a direct payment of $750 million--a promise only made after the first competition received intense criticism. but that was not a fair consideration, according to mayor turner, since that grant had yet to be approved. last june, the northeast action collective and texas housers filed a civil rights complaint with hud, alleging that the glo discriminated against black and hispanic residents. in a recent letter sharing the findings of its investigation, the federal agency sided with the organizations, saying the competition ``substantially and predictably disadvantaged minority residents, with particularly disparate outcomes for black residents.'' a major issue, according to hud, was that the state agency split the competition in two. half the funds were reserved for counties that the federal government had identified as hardest hit by harvey--where black and hispanic residents were most likely to live--while the other half went to more rural, inland counties included on the state's expanded list, which tended to be whiter. at minimum, hud required that half of the funds would go to communities on its list of hardest-hit counties. while the state agency met that requirement, dividing the competition in two also meant awards to those counties would be capped at 50 percent. but those counties represented 90 percent of the population in the entire competition, amounting to much less money available for black and hispanic residents. after the winners were announced in may 2021, glo spokeswoman brittany eck backed the results in a statement to the houston chronicle. ``it is important that texas inland counties are resilient as they provide vital assistance to our coastal communities during events such as asset staging, evacuations, sheltering, and emergency response/recovery,'' she said. the competition favored smaller communities. a flood control project in houston's mostly black and hispanic neighborhood of kashmere gardens, hud's letter explained, would have helped 8,845 residents. but houston's total population is 2.3 million, so the project scored less than 1 out of 10 points because it would help only a small percentage of residents. on the other hand, the city of iola applied for a wastewater project that all 379 of its residents would gain from. it scored 10 out of 10, and the project was funded. in an email to grist, eck accused the federal agency of ``blatant political theater.'' she said glo has complied with hud's requirements, and now it is being faulted for not ``going above and beyond'' to benefit even more minority residents than it already has. eck said the land office is appealing hud's findings. ``glo did not engage in discrimination, and hud's allegations amount to nothing more than unlawful attempts to `second-guess' glo's open and transparent competition process, which was approved by hud,'' eck said. when the state agency's spending plan was still a draft, madison sloan, director of the disaster recovery and fair housing project at texas appleseed, a public interest justice center, sent a letter detailing concerns that its scoring system would divert money from the hardest-hit areas. ``i do not want to deny that communities all over the state need mitigation,'' she said. ``but when you look at where the damage was, where people are most vulnerable, it is the coast. what this represents is a missed opportunity to do some really largescale, meaningful mitigation on the coast that is going to protect a lot of people.'' these problems are not limited to houston. along the coast, other cities hit hard by hurricane harvey, like beaumont, corpus christi, and port arthur, lost out in the competition. in port arthur, where the poverty rate is twice the national average, floods propelled by nearly 50 inches of rain devastated the housing stock. decades of underinvestment have eroded residents' ability to recover from disasters, said michelle smith, marketing director at the community in-power and development association, inc., an environmental justice group in the city. some decided to leave port arthur entirely because ``they had nothing to come back to,'' she said. so it stung when the city's proposal for a $97 million drainage project was rejected. without these funds, communities that were poorly equipped for harvey are just as vulnerable to the next storm. ``this is an ongoing thing,'' smith said. ``with each hurricane, we continue to suffer because we are not able to recover. the little bit that we can salvage is then taken away again and again and again.'' sloan thinks the whole situation exposes fissures in hud's mitigation program. it is largely up to states to decide how to divvy up funds, but studies are needed in advance to ensure fair distribution, she said. that does not just benefit the vulnerable; it could make the coast, as a whole, more resilient. ``funding to areas where vulnerable people of color live is going to benefit plenty of white people, plenty of higher- income people who also live in those areas,'' she said. ``in this case, in general, equity means everyone wins.'' after backlash followed the first competition, the state's land office announced that it would give the remaining funds to regional bodies like the houston-galveston area council to distribute--the same entity that offered houston a minuscule amount of federal aid. ``the glo's solution to not doing a second competition was pushing the responsibility to local jurisdictions,'' said orduna, who felt the new plan does not rectify hud's allegations of discrimination. there will be other storms to come, and congress will eventually allocate more money to rebuild from them. when that happens, billy guevara, of the northeast action collective, worries all the talk and reports will have been just that. ``that is our biggest fear,'' he said. ``being overlooked again.'' ms. jackson lee. madam speaker, my amendment is extremely important. very quickly, it deals with accountability and performance improvement. these are the objectives of my amendment. my amendment also deals with making sure, through a gao study, that csbg has performed well; which programmatic activities, services, and other uses of funds were the most effective and had the greatest positive impact; which administrative, organizational, structural, and operational strategies and tactics that were deployed were most successful; how much of the csbg funds were allocated to states for distribution to and use by community action agencies; and whether these grants retained by each state exceeded the percentage of such funds that were allowed to be retained. in effect, the gao would be conducting a performance audit of this program to position it for a fresh start by determining the extent to which these funds reached their intended beneficiaries. many times, minorities, though it was directed for them, are disadvantaged because of the agency. finally, the net result will be transparency and improvement so that others will be served and helped. i thank you for including it in the amendments en bloc. madam speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 5129, the ``community service block grant modernization act of 2022.'' i applaud leadership for bringing h.r. 5129--which has strong bipartisan support--to the floor for consideration and votes. for decades, the community service block grant (csbg) has fueled a wide range of anti-poverty programs, activities, and services across the country. it has been profoundly beneficial, improving countless lives by helping americans who are most in need of an assist, enabling them to rise up and access the path to a better quality-of-life. h.r. 5129 not only provides a long-overdue reauthorization of the program; it also improves the csbg in many ways, including by adding systems that will enhance the program's transparency, accountability, and evaluations in the future. accountability and performance improvement are also the objectives of the jackson lee amendment, through additional mechanisms. my amendment would direct the comptroller general of the gao to study how the csbg has performed over the past ten years, focusing on: which programmatic activities, services, and other uses of funds were the most effective and had the greatest positive impact on individuals and communities that the csbg was designed to serve; which administrative, organizational, structural, and operational strategies and tactics that were deployed by states were the most productive, efficient, and successful, such that they should be considered as ``best practices'' for replication by other states going forward; how much of csbg funds that were allocated to states for distribution to, and use by, community action agencies and other eligible entities were not fully disbursed by states to those intended recipients; and whether csbg funds retained by each state exceeded the percentage of such funds that were allowed to be retained by the state for [[page h4948]] administrative and other permissible purposes, the amount that was retained in excess of what was allowed, and to what other uses those funds were applied or to what other account were they transmitted. in effect, the gao would be conducting a ``performance audit'' of the csbg program to position it for a fresh start, citing its strengths and shortcomings, and making recommendations that will help states optimize their efforts in the years ahead. by determining the extent to which csbg funds reached their intended beneficiaries and fulfilled their intended purpose, we will see which states have been conscientiously administering the program, which could help calibrate future strategies to structure and monitor the program. the net result is that the gao study and report provided by the jackson lee amendment will provide transparency and accountability to the program's recent past performance. the findings will enable the program, and the states that administer it, to learn from the past, adjust their programs to maximize results, and revitalize their efforts for each state's next chapter of csbg performance. thank you, madam speaker, for bringing this very important bipartisan legislation to the floor today. i urge all my colleagues to support the bill, including the jackson lee amendment and the entire en bloc amendment. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1015 ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time to close. madam speaker, once again, i reiterate that these amendments en bloc contain commonsense proposals that strengthen the underlying bill. i appreciate my colleagues for their contributions and their strong support of improving access to services, combating poverty, and uplifting low-income people in our communities. i strongly urge support of the amendments en bloc and the underlying bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time to close. my friends at home tell me all the time that they believe common sense is in short supply in washington. i completely agree with them. it is practically nonexistent on the other side. madam speaker, we can exercise common sense by focusing on reforming the federal safety net so that programs pull people out of poverty and into self-sufficiency and not encouraging them to stay in dependency on the federal government. adding more duplication and bureaucracy to the csbg program will not accomplish that goal. i urge my colleagues to oppose these amendments and yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 1097, the previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentlewoman from oregon (ms. bonamici). the question is on the amendments en bloc. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. ms. foxx. madam speaker, on that i

foxx) each will control 10 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from oregon. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, this en bloc includes several amendments that i believe would vastly improve the underlying legislation. first, one of the included amendments will address a critical concern. i cannot support any legislation that opens the door for taxpayer funding of abortion, and this bill opens that door. the legislation includes vague language allowing program funds to address health needs and improve health and well-being. while this might sound nice at first blush, it hides a huge problem. i am concerned that instead of helping people receive high-quality healthcare, it will lead to taxpayer dollars funding abortions. the majority of americans oppose seeing their hard-earned dollars go to pay for abortions, and we must do all in our power to stop that from ever happening. this amendment will make sure that no taxpayer dollars are used to reimburse healthcare services. it will also ensure that taxpayer dollars are not used for experimental gender hormone medications or other harmful gender medical interventions. additionally, this amendment takes the commonsense steps to prohibit taxpayer dollars from funding lobbying activities and voter registration activities. h.r. 5129 would allow program funds to be used for voter registration efforts. while getting more eligible individuals registered to vote is a worthy goal, we should not jeopardize the integrity of this program or let the next election distract from serving low-income americans. finally, this amendment ensures that limited federal funds are spent on those americans most in need by maintaining the poverty threshold that exists in current law. increasing this threshold will just expand the pool of eligible participants and stretch resources thinner. we need to tailor the program to ensure that federal dollars serve those most in need. madam speaker, i hope my colleagues will support this group of amendments, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, i rise in strong opposition to these amendments en bloc. the amendments contained in this en bloc are either a distraction from the bipartisan work we are doing today or fundamentally undermine the improvements we are putting forth in this legislation. notably, this en bloc includes yet another republican attack on women's rights and liberty. instead of focusing on what we have accomplished together to strengthen this program in a bipartisan way, some of my colleagues across the aisle are trying to further divide us. madam speaker, it has been 24 years since the last reauthorization of the community services block grant program in 1998. [[page h4949]] our communities need a comprehensive reauthorization, not a partisan controversy that will delay the urgent need to renew this program. from the beginning of the program, community action agencies have addressed the health needs of low-income individuals in their communities, particularly important to rural communities. the 1964 economic opportunity act, which first authorized the community action program, the predecessor to csbg, specifies that such program shall be conducted in those fields with the purposes of this part, including employment, job training and counseling, and health, indicating that health has always been and continues to be a core part of addressing poverty conditions that is the central mission of these agencies. additionally, this en bloc would seek to strip out language from h.r. 5129 allowing caas, community action agencies, to serve individuals up to 200 percent of the federal poverty line. congress supported, in a bipartisan manner, allowing community action agencies to serve individuals up to 200 percent of the poverty line to provide flexibility during the covid-19 pandemic. the cares act, for example, the fy 2022 labor/hhs appropriations bill, and the recently passed omnibus all included an allowance for caas to serve individuals up to 200 percent of the poverty line. the csbg statute, which we know now is more than 20 years out of date, sets the income eligibility for csbg services at 100 percent of the official poverty line or 125 percent if the state chooses. currently, the very low-income eligibility criteria--this is equivalent to about $27,180 for a single person in 2022--for csbg creates a cliff. individuals will be cut off from public assistance and services as soon as they make a dime over the income threshold. we must remember that community action agencies are unique, as they do not operate a single program. rather, caas operate and often coordinate an array of federal, state, and local programs, all with varying eligibility requirements. for example, more than half of community action agencies operate the weatherization assistance program. that uses 200 percent of the poverty income guidance as the eligibility criteria. i will share a story of daniel from north dakota. when the pandemic struck, daniel was working in a fast-food restaurant, and his hours were reduced. with his employment income, he is above the statutory 125 percent, but below the 200 percent flexibility congress has provided with bipartisan support. unfortunately, daniel's housing was unstable, and he was couch surfing. he received case management to assist with his housing search. through csbg funds provided under the cares act, he received assistance with a security deposit in february of 2021. with this assistance, daniel has maintained stable housing for over a year. madam speaker, daniel's story is just one example of why raising the federal poverty level eligibility to 200 percent is so critical to this legislation. unlike the underlying legislation, these amendments en bloc would weaken csbg, or it offers solutions in search of problems. one of the needless proposals in this en bloc actually duplicates the current funding restriction in the bill and statute for voter registration activities which, of course, are nonpartisan activities. madam speaker, we are here today to support a bipartisan csbg reauthorization and the important work of community action agencies in our communities. these amendments en bloc would move us backward. i strongly urge my colleagues to reject these amendments in this en bloc and support the underlying bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. good). mr. good of virginia. madam speaker, the supreme court seems poised to finally, mercifully, reverse the only decision in the history of the court that has cost more than 60 million precious innocent lives which, by the way, beyond the moral travesty, has contributed massively to our labor shortages and social security and medicare being on the verge of bankruptcy. in typical fashion, democrats are revealing who they are with their response, and their unlawful protests and intimidation tactics at the homes of the justices, while the administration and their allies in this body cheer them on. democrats cannot win at the ballot box or through the legislative process, so they try to eliminate the electoral college, rig election laws, eliminate the filibuster, pack the supreme court, pack the senate, give statehood to d.c. and puerto rico, and now threaten justices at their homes. this is because democrats are the radical extremists on abortion. they have become the party of death. their position is abortion at any time, for any reason, up to and beyond the moment of birth, with taxpayers being forced to fund it. i did not hear any democrats criticize the former governor of virginia when he said a couple of years ago that a mother and her doctor can have a conversation after a baby is born and decide whether or not to kill it. i say, let us have this fight in this congress. we had an election 6 months ago in purple virginia when everyone knew that the supreme court would be reviewing roe v. wade, and the party of death got trounced in that election. republicans must embrace this moment and stand for life, expose democrats for the radical extremists they are, and work to end the brutal, horrific practice of abortion. to democrats, i say bring it on. let democrats defend piercing a baby's skull and sucking out its brains, tearing an infant limb from limb, or burning it alive with a saline injection. call it what it is and call them out for supporting abortion with no restrictions whatsoever. just this week, democrats pushed another failed abortion-on-demand vote in the senate, a bill that passed this house with no republican votes but, sadly, all but one democrat supporting it, as they try to ensure that america remains among the most extreme nations in the world with the most radical laws on abortion. now, this current piece of legislation will permit federal dollars to be used to harm the unborn, as it includes a provision that allows taxpayer dollars to be used to ``address health needs and improve health and well-being'' and ``to identify and respond to physical and behavioral health challenges.'' however, a recent marist poll found that 54 percent of americans oppose using taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. my amendment would protect taxpayers from being forced to pay for abortions, even if hyde were repealed. if this bill is not intended to fund abortion, then accept and pass my amendment. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i have a lot to say in response to the gentleman, but i am going to take a deep breath and say, this is a bill about helping to lift low-income americans out of poverty. it is a bipartisan bill we have been working on for many years. it is time to update the community services block grant program and help lift low- income americans in oregon and across the country out of poverty. i oppose these amendments en bloc, and i encourage my colleagues to oppose them. i continue to reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from michigan (mrs. mcclain.) mrs. mcclain. madam speaker, i would agree with my colleague across the aisle, this bill should be about lifting families out of poverty and providing hope to underserved communities. let us do that, and let us actually for once in agreement, let us put our money where our mouth is and let us actually make sure that the dollars are actually used for what the bill intends them to be used for. we should not be blurring lines between workforce issues and political campaigns. this is not a political campaign, correct? facilities used for community service block grants should not be open to political activities during operation hours. sadly, this is exactly what my colleagues on the other side want, and they are notorious for talking about a bill and then packing it full of something that has nothing to do with the bill. so let us do what we say we are going to do and actually help the communities. [[page h4950]] {time} 1030 where does this end? this is the foot in the door to allow real partisan action to be commingled with federal programs. we have a clear example of this that is happening today. need i remind everyone about acorn? that should be example enough to illustrate why this is a terrible idea but, apparently, not for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. my amendment is simple. it would remove the troubling language in this bill that allows taxpayer-funded community action centers to be used to increase voting registration. let us keep the bill to what you say it is going to be. it would also prohibit community service block grant funds from any lobbying activities. again, let us actually use the funds for the people in the community, not the politics. we all want eligible americans to register to vote and actually get to the polls on election day. but that is not the purpose of the community block grants. this bill should not blur the lines between educational and political activities. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. grothman). mr. grothman. madam speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding. madam speaker, there are certainly many concerns over this bill. the one that i would like to highlight today is that they are greatly increasing the expansion of eligibility for the bill. now, that does not necessarily mean the bill is going to make things more expensive, but you know very well if we are going to bring a whole lot of new areas into the bill, if we do not increase the spending, the areas that are currently part of the community services block grant are going to go down. i do not believe the majority party is going to let anybody go down, which means this bill anticipates a significant increase in spending on this program. this is one of many programs that i would argue, under the constitution, really even should not be a federal concern. it should be a local concern. to double the eligibility to 200 percent and make that permanent is resulting at a time when our spending is just completely out of control, setting up a situation in which there will be dramatic spending on another government program. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i am prepared to close, and i continue to reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, my colleagues have presented many good arguments against this bill in general and why we should be voting for these amendments that are in this en bloc. these amendments will provide needed improvements to the underlying legislation and make sure that program funds are spent on the program's original goal, serving low- income americans and helping them get out of poverty. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this en bloc amendment, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, again, i reiterate my strong opposition to this en bloc amendment and support for the underlying bill. this bipartisan bill is about improving services for our communities through community action, and these efforts are long overdue. unlike the underlying bill that enjoys broad bipartisan support and reflects the input of stakeholders who represent these agencies and their vital work in our communities, this en bloc amendment ignores what we have accomplished together to strengthen this program and seeks to further divide us. rather than addressing the real needs of low-income individuals, this en bloc amendment attacks women's reproductive rights at a time when they are under attack nationally. the sponsors of this en bloc amendment have injected controversy into a policy on voter registration, which is nonpartisan. head start has had a nearly identical policy for the last 40 years with little evidence of a problem. together, these amendments all failed in our bipartisan committee markup, and they should again. madam speaker, i strongly urge my colleagues to reject this en bloc amendment and support the underlying bill. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 1097, the previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentlewoman from oregon (ms. bonamici). the question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentlewoman from oregon (ms. bonamici). the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. ms. foxx. madam speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to section 3(s) of house resolution 8, the yeas and nays are ordered. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this question are postponed. amendment no. 4 offered by mr. gottheimer the speaker pro tempore. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 4 printed in part f of house report 117-320. mr. gottheimer. madam speaker, pursuant to section 10 of house resolution 1097, i rise to offer an amendment. the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 24, line 14, strike ``and'' at the end. page 24 line 19, strike the period at the end and insert ``; and''. page 24, after line 19, insert the following: ``(ix) providing support to eligible entities to address the needs of veterans, particularly homeless veterans.''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 1097, the gentleman from new jersey (mr. gottheimer) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new jersey. mr. gottheimer. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, i rise in support of my amendment to the bipartisan community services block grant modernization act. before i begin, i thank all the veterans back in my home district in northern new jersey and nationwide from the bottom of my heart for putting your lives on the line to defend our freedom, our families, and the greatest democracy the world has ever known. please know this: after sacrificing so much, no veteran should ever struggle to get the care or recognition he or she has earned. we should always get their backs. my amendment to the legislation we are considering today will do just that. it will add critical support for our brave veterans, particularly homeless veterans, to the list of allowable purposes on which state governments, including my state of new jersey, may deploy federal community services block grant program investments. the bipartisan community services block grant program helps to reduce poverty, revitalize communities, and empower families and individuals to become fully self-sufficient. it helps individuals, like veterans, to get and keep a good job, a good education, housing, healthcare, and emergency assistance and, above all, to participate more actively in their communities. in new jersey, the program annually serves more than 200,000 individuals and 130,000 families through the work of 25 community action agencies. these agencies are typically private nonprofit organizations, public agencies, or local government entities, like greater bergen county community action, which provides education and training, financial counseling, and more; or bergen county's government, where our county executive and commissioners have focused like a laser beam on successfully helping combat veteran homelessness. the bipartisan legislation on the floor today will make important updates to the community services block grant program. my amendment will add support for veterans and, in particular, as i said, homeless veterans to the list of investments states like new jersey can make through the program. with this amendment, community action agencies will work alongside state and local agencies to raise [[page h4951]] awareness among veterans of housing programs and help those who bravely served our country to secure the housing they need. once stable housing is secured, community action agencies will work with veterans and other eligible individuals to ensure the full range of community resources, including workforce training, health resources, and opportunities for peer support, are available to those veterans who need it most. supporting our nation's veterans with the community services block grant program is the least we can do. after serving our country and putting their lives on the line to defend our freedom and democracy, our nation's veterans should not struggle to get the resources they have earned. but far too often, our veterans face issues finding housing and employment. it is unacceptable. on any given night, the federal government estimates that more than 40,000 veterans are homeless. on top of that, data shows that the unemployment rate of veterans ages 18 to 65 is higher than the unemployment rate of nonveterans. today's amendment builds on the work i helped lead, working with both sides of the aisle in recent months and since i was elected, to support our servicemembers, veterans, and veteran families. the first piece of legislation i passed in congress was to expand hiring of post-9/11 veterans. just weeks ago, i was proud to join my colleagues in passing a 2.7 percent pay raise for members of the military to ensure we are getting the backs of those who bravely have ours. late last year, the house passed the bipartisan student veterans counseling centers eligibility act, which will expand access to mental health services for veterans utilizing their gi benefits at colleges and universities through established vet centers. in march, we passed the bipartisan guard and reserve gi bill parity act to help expand access to gi benefits for members of our military who serve in the national guard and reserves, as they do not receive the same access to vital gi benefits that they deserve as well. also in march, working with the members of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus, we passed the honoring our pact act here in the house to help veterans exposed to burn pits, covering veterans dating back to 1991 and operation desert storm and through our more recent post-9/11 conflicts. this included my key provisions to address the mental health impacts for toxic exposure for veterans and to ensure va information on toxic exposure illnesses is published in multiple languages, like korean and spanish, to help even more of our veterans. back home in new jersey, i have been fighting for expanded access to healthcare services, and i helped establish the mental health services at the va community-based outpatient clinic in newton in sussex county, new jersey. i am working to cut through red tape with the va community care network to ensure eligible north jersey veterans are able to receive referrals for community care at imagecare centers across the fifth district. we have made critical progress on that front. now, more veterans in my district have greater access to healthcare that they deserve. let me just say, these are not democratic or republican issues. they are red, white, and blue issues. they are issues core to protecting our great democracy, the ones our veterans have always fought for. there is nothing more important in this job than our responsibility to have the backs of those who have served our great nation, whether that is at the va, a mental health issue, or helping veterans find housing or get jobs when they come back home. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of my amendment to add support for veterans to the list of eligible community services block grant investments. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i claim the time in opposition, but i am not opposed. the speaker pro tempore. the gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes. ms. foxx. madam speaker, we owe our military veterans a huge debt of gratitude, and we must make sure they are well supported as they transition back into the civilian workforce. this amendment encourages the csbg program to meet the needs of low- income veterans, especially homeless veterans. it is surprising to me that we need to put such an amendment in this bill because we would think that the csbg program would already be doing it. but since this is a worthy goal and one that i support, i will support this amendment. in fact, madam speaker, i wear a pin every day with the united states flag, the north carolina flag, and a banner under it that says: ``i support veterans.'' therefore, i must support an amendment that would support veterans. while i have concerns with the underlying bill, i think this is a good amendment, and i appreciate the gentleman offering it. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. gottheimer. madam speaker, i thank the ranking member for her comments and for the support of veterans. madam speaker, i yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from oregon (ms. bonamici). ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i thank representative gottheimer for his amendment and for his leadership in addressing the needs of our country's veterans. madam speaker, this amendment will help community action agencies meet the needs of veterans, particularly homeless veterans. although many community action agencies already implement other federal programs serving veterans, this amendment will emphasize that all eligible entities are able and equipped to serve veterans and their communities. again, i thank my colleague for offering this amendment, and i thank the ranking member for supporting it as well. mr. gottheimer. madam speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. foxx. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, we must do all we can to make sure we help low-income and homeless veterans. i think this amendment furthers that effort. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 1097, the previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman from new jersey (mr. gottheimer). the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from new jersey (mr. gottheimer). the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. clyde. madam speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to section 3(s) of house resolution 8, the yeas and nays are ordered. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this question are postponed. ____________________
