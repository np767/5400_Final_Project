motion at the desk. the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will designate the motion. the text of the motion is as follows: ms. johnson of texas moves that the house concur in the senate amendment to the house amendment to the senate amendment to h.r. 4346. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 1289, the motion shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on science, space, and technology or their respective designees. the gentlewoman from texas (ms. johnson) and the gentleman from oklahoma (mr. lucas) each will control 30 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from texas. general leave ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on h.r. 4346, the bill now under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from texas? there was no objection. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i stand before you today to strongly urge support for the chips and science act. the chips act and the bipartisan science, space, and technology committee provisions that form this package are vital to ensuring a bold and prosperous future for american science and innovation, maintaining our international competitiveness, and bolstering our economic and national security. these provisions were built with rigorous input from the scientific community, industry, academia, and other stakeholders on what they need most to succeed in the 21st century. this final product is the result of months of bipartisan negotiations. it is also the result of dedicated efforts and long hours put in by the committee staff, and i thank each of them for helping us to get where we are today. {time} 1300 with this legislation, we will bring about solutions for the climate crisis, enhance our semiconductor research and manufacturing, create jobs, increase regional innovation, and so much more. we will also take historic and much-needed action to build a strong and diverse stem workforce and ensure that we are able to make use of all the brainpower and talent we have in our great nation. with bipartisan stem pieces in this bill, we will create a bright future for all those who want to pursue stem, no matter their race, gender, or zip code. we are ushering in a strong future for our premier scientific agencies with transformational funding at nist, nsf, and doe. we also authorize important activities at nasa and address other discrete research topics across the government's scientific agencies. the united states has long been a beacon of excellence in science and innovation, and it is far past time that we revitalize federal support for the [[page h7375]] initiatives that have enabled us to lead. i am proud of this package, and i am especially proud of the bipartisan provisions in division b that began in the science, space, and technology committee. i thank ranking member lucas for his partnership in this effort. i know that this package does not have everything that everyone wanted. it does not have everything i wanted, but that is the nature of compromise and a result of urgency of this situation. we must pass this legislation immediately to ensure that the united states remains a global leader in science, technology, and innovation and to bolster our economic and national security. i urge all members to put aside politics and support this thoughtful and balanced bipartisan package. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, just 24 hours ago, i expected my remarks on the chips and science act to be very different. i have worked on this bill for more than 3 years. when i first took leadership of the house science, space, and technology committee as ranking member in 2019, developing legislation to strengthen american science and technology was my highest priority. after extensive work, in january of 2020, i introduced a comprehensive bill that created a long-term strategy for investment in basic research and infrastructure to protect the economic and national security of the united states. our committee's chairwoman, eddie bernice johnson, shared my desire to refocus, revitalize, and reinvest in american science, and so we worked together for 2 years, gathering extensive stakeholder feedback and technical advice, while holding multiple hearings with expert witnesses to chart a path forward. this has been an exemplary bipartisan process. chairwoman johnson and her staff have put in countless hours of work with my staff to find strong, consensus policies to support federal r&d. i thank the chairwoman for her partnership and leadership and her staff for their diligence. i also thank my committee staff members, who have put in long hours and hard work to craft what i believe could be a transformational science policy. i particularly thank jennifer wickre, who led this process for us from the very beginning. the science, space, and technology committee's efforts over the past few years and the bipartisan legislation we produced is truly an incredible example of what we can achieve when we work together as responsible legislators in regular order. unfortunately, not everyone shares our commitment to that process. mr. speaker, i was frustrated last year when democratic leadership put off conferencing our competitiveness legislation with our colleagues across the hill in favor of focusing on the doomed build back better act. i was frustrated when the proposed funding for semiconductor manufacturing jumped from $24 billion to $52 billion with no explanation. i was frustrated when, after finally starting on conference negotiations, the other body tied our research policy to reconciliation. i was frustrated when negotiations were shut down, and i was even more frustrated when the house was shut out of discussions once they picked back up. so maybe i should not be surprised, but i am frankly, in all fairness, disgusted by the developments over the last 24 hours. house republicans have been working in good faith this entire time to come to consensus legislation that could be passed by both chambers. but time and time again, we have been thwarted by democratic leadership that has moved the goalposts, shut down the process, chosen their divisive partisan policies over a smart bipartisan bill that would benefit our country for generations. i understand why people on my side of the room are furious. i share those concerns, and i have been around here long enough to know that this is not the way to do things. for better or for worse--and it is very clearly for the worse, i would note--the chips and science act has been irrevocably tied to a massive tax hike and spending spree in reconciliation. the decisions on how to pursue scientific policy are out of the hands of this committee, and at this point practically out of the hands of this chamber. mr. speaker, i remain incredibly proud of the good work we have done to strategically strengthen american research and development. and yet i cannot ignore the fact that the immense tax hikes and irresponsible spending in the expanded reconciliation package change the calculus when it comes to supporting spending bills, particularly a bill that has come to be tied to reconciliation. this is one of those occasions that, as a statesman and responsible member of congress, i have to put aside my own pride in the science, space, and technology committee's work and cast a vote that represents the best interests of americans, and particularly the good people of the third district of oklahoma. so, regrettably--and it is more regrettably than you can possibly imagine--i will not be casting my vote for the chips and science act today. i emphasize that this is in no way a reflection of my feeling about the transformational research policies in this bill. i am grateful to chairwoman johnson for working with me every step of the way to create a strategic, bipartisan, forward-thinking policy. i just wish other legislators in both chambers would follow our example instead of forcing indefensible votes like we have today. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california (ms. pelosi), our distinguished speaker. ms. pelosi. mr. speaker, i rise today in praise of this legislation as the house prepares to pass the chips and science act, a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will well-equip our nation to meet and beat the challenges of the 21st century. with the monumental investments in this legislation, we take key steps to strengthen our families' and our nation's economic future, remove roadblocks to developing scientific talent, and unleash research investment in every corner of america now and for generations to come. let us salute the outstanding leadership of the house negotiators who tirelessly fought for and secured many major victories for american families and the american economy in this package. thank you, in particular, to two terrific champions: chairwoman eddie bernice johnson of the science, space, and technology committee, chairman frank pallone of the energy and commerce committee, as well as other chairs who were involved in this legislation. i also acknowledge the leadership of the ranking member, mr. lucas. it was a joy and inspiring to behold mr. lucas' very informative and impressive presentation in favor of this legislation at the rules committee yesterday. in fact, half a dozen of the bills contained in this legislation are republican bills. i particularly join mr. lucas in commending the staff on this and pay special tribute to jenn wickre, who has been remarkable in building bipartisanship in this legislation. my understanding is that she is recovering at home. i send her best wishes and prayers for a speedy recovery, with deep gratitude for her bipartisanship in putting this legislation together, which you so eloquently supported in the rules committee yesterday. for generations, america has offered a beacon of excellence in science, innovation, and engineering. our research has generated ground-changing discoveries. our industry has powered unprecedented prosperity. our technology has altered the course of history. and our workforce has been the envy of the world. i am so happy that in this legislation up to 100,000 davis-bacon jobs will be created. in recent years, many other nations have followed our blueprint, investing in r&d and manufacturing and education. their rise not only threatens america's status as the world leader in innovation but also the economic security of america's families. that is why, with the landmark legislation that we [[page h7376]] will pass today, we will put america back on the path to preeminence so that we can compete and win in the 21st century. when i mention those 100,000 davis-bacon jobs, that means a prevailing wage for our workers. i salute chairman bobby scott for his work in that regard. it is called the chips and science act, and i am so happy because a week ago i thought it was just going to be the chips act. but, fortunately, with the help of mr. lucas and the negotiations of our distinguished chair, eddie bernice johnson, we were able to get it to be the chips and science act. the chips are for now, that is important, ``make it in america,'' keep us preeminent. the science is about our ongoing preeminence, and we will talk some more about that. again, because of the persistent, patriotic negotiations, the congress can take great pride in this result. eddie bernice johnson has been a respected leader as chair now of the science, space, and technology committee, respected in the science and research community for her ongoing commitment, her knowledge, her vision, her values about keeping america number one. i thank her. the package includes more than $50 billion to bolster america's manufacturing of semiconductors, seizing the pivotal opportunity to restore our status as world leader in chips, make it in america, as mr. hoyer would say. doing so is an economic imperative, creating, again, nearly 100,000 good-paying union jobs and lowering costs for american consumers while producing a crucial component of nearly every major technology we enjoy, including the cars we drive: 1,000 in a car, 2,000 in an electric car. it is also a national security necessity, reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign manufacturing, especially amid growing aggression from the chinese communist party. crucially, the bill contains strong guardrails, ensuring these transformative investments go straight into the american economy, not into stock buybacks or dividends or into facilities overseas. mr. speaker, just as importantly, this legislation will reinvigorate american innovation nationwide with robust investments in research and technology. this bill takes a giant leap toward building a more diverse and inclusive stem workforce so that our nation's brightest minds--wherever they are in whatever communities ethnically, geographically, generationally--are solving problems with science and driving american entrepreneurship. this bill delivers job-creating hubs in every corner across the country so that more communities can participate in research and development, and this bill empowers our nation to push the boundaries of science with investments that power america's preeminence in both basic research and next-generation technologies. in doing so, we ensure america's dominance in the industries of the future for decades to come. {time} 1315 mr. speaker, let me be clear: this legislation is a resounding victory for the american people. indeed, the final package contains a number of key provisions from our america competes act, on the democratic side, which were not included in the senate bill. it was house democrats who secured ironclad guardrails on the chips investments so that the federal funding benefits american workers and interests, not our competitors overseas. it was house democrats who delivered historic funding to transform our nation's research capacity, powering decades of discovery at the national science foundation, department of energy, and national institute of standards and technology. it was house democrats who won smart, strategic investments in our clean energy and industries of the future, supporting renewable energy, combating the climate crisis, and developing cutting-edge technologies. it was house democrats who fought to broaden participation in the innovation economy, building a stem workforce that better reflects the beautiful diversity of our nation while bringing recompete grants-- thank you, mr. kilmer--to persistently distressed communities across the nation. i thank our distinguished chairwoman, eddie bernice johnson, for making so much of that possible. throughout the process of crafting the chips and science act, the congress has approached this work with a proud bipartisan spirit, as was witnessed by mr. lucas' beautiful presentation to the committee on rules yesterday. this legislation was assembled with input from negotiators from both sides of the aisle and both ends of the capitol. it was the product of the committees. in the senate, the bill earned 14 republican senators' votes for final passage. here in the house, the america competes act was rooted in bipartisan bills with broad support in the congress and the country. as i mentioned, six intact republican bills are part of this legislation. mr. speaker, this vital legislation will pass today. it will pass. it would be my hope that it will pass with the broad bipartisan vote that america needs and america deserves. as we send this landmark legislation to president biden's desk, we participate in a great american tradition. in one of his final speeches, president john kennedy addressed the national academy of sciences, where he delivered a powerful case for science as our north star. his words have stood the test of time. he said: ``i believe that the power of science and the responsibility of science have offered mankind a new opportunity not only for intellectual growth, but for moral discipline; not only for the acquisition of knowledge, but for the strengthening of our nerve and our will.'' he knew then, and we know now, science serves as our nerve and our will to boldly seize the opportunities and tackle the challenges of our time. with this legislation, president biden and the democratic congress-- and i would hope in a bipartisan way--proudly charge ahead in this all- american spirit with science, science, science, and science leading the way. people say to me, ``well, science or faith?'' i say i believe that science is an answer to our prayers. mr. speaker, i urge a strong and bipartisan vote for the chips and science act. i thank all who are involved in this, including mr. lucas and our distinguished chair, other chairs on both sides of the capitol, and members on both sides of the aisle. i urge an ``aye'' vote. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. brady), the ranking member of the committee on ways and means. mr. brady. mr. speaker, i thank mr. lucas for his leadership on science, which is of so much importance to our country. it is official; we are in a recession. joe biden's economy is a cruel economy. americans are finding this out more and more each day. this morning's economic report shows negative economic growth. inflation is crushing our families, our small businesses, and our entire economy. now, democrats have confirmed that chips is a green light for higher taxes, corporate welfare, and, even worse, inflation in the future. they are insisting on hundreds of billions of tax increases on companies that build and make in america. they are insisting on unleashing 80,000 new irs agents on american families, farmers, and small businesses. who in their right mind raises taxes as you are entering a recession? now, even republican sponsors of the chips bill in the senate are urging a ``no'' vote. good people can disagree on the contents of the semiconductor issues here. my view is that the original bill misses the mark on national security and provides tax subsidies that are not warranted. china is targeting 10 of our american technologies and industries, including robotics, biotech, artificial intelligence, and on and on. it is a mistake and missed opportunity to subsidize one and help one while ceding nine of our industries and technologies to china. i believe our approach should be to lift all of our industries up so they can compete and win against china. i also believe we have the strongest semiconductor industry on this planet. no one sells more chips around the world than we do. we sell nearly half of [[page h7377]] all the chips. the sales of the chips in america, the market in the world, we sell nearly half of it. our production has been growing for 20 years. it is one of our biggest exports, and we have reliable supply chains because almost half of our chips for america are made here in america. i think there is a smarter way to tackle this issue. i am, like others, stunned by the turnaround--i think the deceit--among senate democrats on taxes and tying it, unfortunately, to this bill. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pallone). mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman from texas, the chairwoman, for all of her work on this bill. i rise in support of h.r. 4346, the chips and science act, that will lower costs for consumers, create good-paying american jobs, and end our dangerous dependence on foreign manufacturers of critical goods. i would like to focus on two key initiatives from the committee on energy and commerce. the american people may not know it, but semiconductors are integral to their everyday experiences. they are the microchips that are used in automobiles, consumer electronics, and washing machines. over the past 30 years, america's share of semiconductor production has plummeted, jeopardizing our national security and economic welfare. the covid-19 pandemic laid bare the vulnerability of our semiconductor supply chains. as a result, automakers, medical supply companies, and manufacturers of heavy machinery faced severe disruptions, which drove up prices. the chips and science act appropriates over $52 billion to ensure more semiconductors are produced right here in the united states, ending our reliance on other countries and lowering costs for consumers. but our competitiveness faces challenges elsewhere. domestic vendors of communications network equipment have dwindled over the past several years, while the proliferation of networks using huawei, a chinese communist company, have grown. just this week, there were reports about how huawei strategically deployed their equipment in u.s. networks to maximize their espionage capabilities. this legislation also invests $1.5 billion in the public wireless supply chain innovation fund for the deployment and promotion of open radio access networks, or open ran networks. this deals with 5g technology. this investment will help bring more diversity and innovation to wireless supply chains while also countering the spread of harmful network equipment, like huawei, here and around the world. mr. speaker, this bill is a win-win for our global competitiveness, economy, and consumers. i urge all of my colleagues to support it today. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from washington (mrs. rodgers), the ranking member of the committee on energy and commerce. mrs. rodgers of washington. mr. speaker, china is the biggest threat facing america today. the chinese communist party uses its centrally controlled economy to pick winners and losers through massive government subsidies and handouts that benefit the ruling party's political allies. they do not adhere to free-market principles and the high labor and environmental standards that we have here in america. this is not a model america should embrace. we succeed when we reward hard work, creative thinking, risk-taking, and innovation and ensure that a company's success is not contingent on the approval, direction, or spending by the federal government. i support making chips in the united states, but we cannot lead a new era of innovation through massive government subsidies. we cannot beat china by trying to outspend them. the chips bill unlocks the democrats' radical tax and spending spree and will make president biden's inflation crisis worse. american competitiveness is suffering today as a result of harmful regulatory barriers and record government spending. this has resulted in unaffordable, high prices for every family, supply chain issues, and, as we learned today, the u.s. is entering a recession. meanwhile, democrats' new reconciliation package spends hundreds of billions of dollars and raises taxes to achieve their grand socialist agenda for more control and more inflation. to win the future, we need a reliable regulatory and permitting environment that unleashes innovation, secures our supply chains, and ensures american companies are creating jobs right here at home in the united states of america. instead of more radical spending, lifting these barriers must be central if we want to secure american leadership and beat china. mr. speaker, i urge a ``no'' vote on h.r. 4346. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california (ms. matsui). ms. matsui. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of the bipartisan chips and science act. just over 2 years ago, i joined congressman mccaul to introduce the chips for america act to reassert american leadership in the strategically important semiconductor industry. i will admit, when senator cornyn, senator warner, congressman mccaul, and i started this effort, a lot of members would ask me: what are these semiconductors, and why are they so important? well, i think it is clear this bill answers that question. semiconductors are fundamental building blocks of the 21st century economy, and we simply cannot live without them. but since we started this effort, the global chip shortage has only grown more severe and the need for legislation more pressing. thankfully, by passing the chips bill today, we are sending a clear message: the united states is still the gold standard for innovation. i am glad we are acting today because other countries are not waiting. they are making aggressive investments to try to surpass us. the european chips act sets a goal of reaching 20 percent of worldwide semiconductor production by 2030. in asia, korea and india offer 50 percent design credits, and taiwan offers a 15 percent r&d credit. so, passing chips gives us the tools we need to stay ahead of the pack. bringing manufacturing and research back to the united states will have positive benefits in the short and long term. as new fabs funded by the chips act come online, they hold the potential to anchor regional technology clusters, creating well-paying jobs and spreading out america's base of skilled workers. this, in turn, can provide a more secure and resilient supply chain for the mission-critical components our national security apparatus needs to succeed. this makes america safer and more secure. i am also thrilled to have helped author legislation included in this package that will supercharge american 5g networks with more resilient supply chains through open ran investments. this new technology will pave the way for american companies to enter the telecom market and compete. as an author of both the chips and open ran funding bills, i know these critical economic drivers will drive innovation and create american job opportunities for years to come. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support the chips and science act. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from nebraska (mr. smith), a member of the committee on ways and means. mr. smith of nebraska. mr. speaker, i rise today in opposition to this legislation. when i recently visited with a manufacturer in my district whose products are highly dependent on access to chips, they told me that chips only comprise 5 percent of their supply chain challenges. chips are one of 10 sectors where china is seeking to break american dominance. this bill does not address our issues with china. it certainly does not address the other nine issues where china is also seeking to break american dominance. for the same cost of these chips provisions, we could enact better r&d policy, ensure interest expensing, and bring ip back to the u.s. broad-based policies would help all sectors of our economy. [[page h7378]] i am as disappointed by what is not in this bill as i am disappointed with what is in it. i am disappointed this bill does not include reauthorizations of noncontroversial trade policies which waive tariffs on manufacturing inputs for our domestic manufacturers and ensure fair treatment of u.s. products when we export them to developing countries. renewing these longstanding policies would help address our supply chain crisis, yet house democrats refuse to bring reasonable reauthorizations to the floor. this bill falls short. it is the wrong bill at the wrong time, and i will be voting ``no.'' i urge my colleagues to do the same. {time} 1330 ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. neal). mr. neal. mr. speaker, i thank the chairwoman for her good work. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the chips and science act. we are here to put people over political discussions by lowering costs, creating jobs, and supercharging our domestic manufacturing. our domestic manufacturing from time to time has lagged; and in this legislation, we will reinvigorate our chip production nationwide. through sensible tax credits, we will incentivize further research and development and bring 100,000 good-paying jobs to the american family. i do not understand how the other side can be opposed to this. this is an argument about national security. that is what this is about when everything is pushed back. we have this opportunity here to put aside the theatrical discussion and proceed with sensible, substantive legislation. let us get on voting for this chips and science act. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new york (mr. katko). mr. katko. mr. speaker, i thank ranking member lucas for yielding. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of the chips plus act. this legislation has the potential to bring transformational investments to my district in central new york and will take long overdue steps to shore up our domestic supply chain for semiconductors. significantly, this measure has the support of pillars from the previous administration on national security and economic matters: mike pompeo, former secretary of state, supports it. wilbur ross, former secretary of commerce, supports it. mark esper, former secretary of defense, supports it. robert lighthizer, former u.s. trade representative, supports it. and robert o'brien, former national security adviser, supports it. that is impactful to me, and it should be impactful to all americans. all of these former administration officials recognize the inherent danger of ceding ground on technological development to the malign chinese communist party; and like me, i am sure none of these officials will support the partisan reconciliation package the democrats are cooking up to raise taxes. we cannot control that. we are not in the majority. this is a separate bill, and we need to focus on what we are voting on today, not tomorrow, not next week, not next month. it is vital that we pass this, and i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting chips plus. i will note this in closing: whatever we invest in today we will get back many times more by the private investment and all the economic growth it is going to spur. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from new york (mrs. carolyn b. maloney). mrs. carolyn b. maloney of new york. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the chips and science act, a historic bill that should have strong bipartisan support because it will lower costs for american families and restore american leadership in industries that are critical to our economic and national security. this bill is a strong response to countries like china that aim to threaten our industrial base, supply chains, intellectual property, and technology security. this bill will help ensure that america cannot be threatened and will no longer accept the outsourcing of critical industries. we took an important step to address this in the president's infrastructure act, which included an important measure i championed to ensure personal protective equipment is made in america. never again will new york health workers be forced to wear trash bags to protect themselves from a deadly pandemic because china was blocking shipments of personal protective equipment. the chips and science act ensures we are making it in america, creating 100,000 good-paying jobs to manufacture critical semiconductor components right here in the u.s. employing americans. it also turbocharges our research and development investment and workforce to ensure america is leading in next-generation innovations. i am so proud of the work of the oversight and reform committee to support this legislation and proud to cast my vote for it today. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from oklahoma (mr. hern). mr. hern. mr. speaker, i thank my good friend, a member of my delegation and my colleague, mr. lucas, for his leadership on this bill. no one has worked harder on this issue, and the fact that he is willing to stand up against it today is a testament to the importance of stopping the build back broke plan. america is in crisis. even obama's economic advisers agree that wasteful government spending is what got us into this mess. and yet, the democrats continue to push for more. we are staring down the barrel of another useless, wasteful build back broke plan that will only make our problems worse. we should not pass one more bill on this floor until we see a bill than reins in government spending, lowers taxes, unleashes american energy, and gets americans back to work. when the government spends more, the american people have less. the time to fight is now. i hope all of my colleagues will join me in opposition to this legislation. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from maryland (mr. hoyer), our distinguished majority leader. mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, i regret that we find ourselves in this position of being divided on this bill. this, like every piece of legislation we pass, is not perfect. and very frankly, if we made a judgment on every piece of legislation that we considered that i do not like some other bill, we would be in real trouble. and maybe we are in real trouble. there was a manifesto put out by xi and putin when they met some months ago. essentially what that manifesto said is the dictatorships, the authoritarian regimes are going to win because democracies cannot make decisions, they are too divided, they are too slow. this is what they were thinking about. this is a good piece of legislation. it is not the piece of legislation that i would have written, but it is a good piece of legislation that does good things for america, and more importantly, good things for our competitive status in the world. mr. speaker, the pandemic has taught us many lessons. one of those lessons, reinforced by vladimir putin's criminal war against ukraine, is that we cannot and must not rely on the unreliable. let me repeat that. america must not rely on the unreliable. we saw from the pandemic how reliable we were for so many things we needed to meet the crisis of the pandemic. the minority leader, who told us all that he was going to urge all of his colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill, talked about inflation. one of the reasons we have inflation is because we have shortages. that is what drives prices up when demand is high and supply is low. you do not have to be an economist to get that lesson. this bill seeks to address that issue because as we all know, chips are ubiquitous in almost everything that we have that has anything to do with electronics. every day, americans see examples of why we must take steps to make our [[page h7379]] supply chains more secure and more reliable. this deals with that. yet my republican friends urge a ``no'' vote, not because they think this bill is bad--they may--but because they do not like another bill. that is what xi and putin are counting on. that is what the autocrats and authoritarians around the world are counting on, that democracies come to a halt. because as democracies they debate and they differ, and they cannot make decisions even when a significant number of the minority party is for this bill. one-third of the united states senate republicans voted for this bill because they thought it was good for competition between us and china and between us and everybody else. that is why it is so sad for me to come here seeing this division on a partisan basis because of another bill. and so america, if we do not prevail on this bill, will see our competitive edge squandered because as the secretary of commerce says, there are a lot of countries that are going to put money on the table and say come to me. i am ready. you build your factory here. you build your chips here. and if america needs chips, if our manufacturers need chips, well, they can come to us. not good. good for putin. good for xi. not for us. we must not rely on hostile foreign competitors to supply critical components that sustain america's manufacturing base. chips are at the heart of that. that is what this bill is about. that is why we bellied up to the bar. that is why we are putting a lot of money on the table. this is not the reconciliation bill. this is about america. it is not about republicans or democrats. this is about america, american workers, american competitiveness, american manufacturers, american technology. i thank the chair for the extraordinary investment she has led in making our research and development compete with china in a way that we will win. and if we win, our workers and our people will win. microchips. in 2022, microchips are in nearly every product, as i said, from phones to cars to children's toys. at the same time, advanced semiconductors are becoming more and more integral to high- tech, advanced manufacturing processes, making them critical to our economy. yes, we can wait, maybe until tomorrow, maybe until january when the minority party takes over--so they think. maybe we will wait until then. or maybe that will not happen, and we will wait 24 months and xi and putin will be saying, hey, yeah, you go to it. they are lobbying against this bill. they are lobbying, paying to defeat this bill. do not be their handmaiden. america needs a unified congress if it is going to compete. indivisible, one nation. one of the best ways for us to ease inflation and bring costs down for american workers and consumers is to remove these supply pressures by making more of these critical components here in our country instead of relying on importing them from abroad. that is what we heard over and over and over again from the united states senate. we are making materials here at home, creating jobs, and streamlining our supply chains with this bill. this bipartisan legislation--17 republicans, one-third of the united states senate republicans voted for this bill. this bipartisan legislation, the chips and science act, which will always be for me the make it in america act, represents the most significant investment in easing inflation and promoting american manufacturing and innovation that we have seen in a generation. this is a make it in america bill. every time i say that to an audience, no matter how red or conservative or how blue or how liberal, they all shake their head, yes, we need to make it in america. that is what this bill is about. while it is not as broad as i and others in the house had hoped for, the bill, nevertheless, achieves so many of our goals. do not look a gift horse in the mouth and say no. it makes good on promises that our majority made to the american people to govern responsibly and build a post-pandemic economy that works better for more americans. but this was a bill that was fashioned in a bipartisan way. {time} 1345 nobody said at the time, well, it will be for this bill if we like every one of the bills you are supporting--what a negative way to perceive legislation to approach how you vote. this legislation contains substantial new investment in science, research, and innovation--again, thank you, eddie bernice johnson-- which will help us maintain our competitive edge, commercialize new discoveries, and train our workforce to succeed in the global economy. the investments we are making in this legislation are not only a major victory for american businesses and workers; they achieve a big part of the make it in america plan, which i have talked about since 2010. that is, making supply chains more resilient. when we make microchips and semiconductors in america, more of our workers and entrepreneurs will surely ``make it'' in america. across america, we are now observing made in america week. is not that ironic? this is made in america week, yet we have a bill on the floor which invests in making it in america. the minority leader said on this floor: i am urging all of my republican colleagues to vote ``no.'' surely not because they are against making it in america but because they do not like some other bill, and they are going to stamp their feet and have a tantrum about the other bill. this legislation now truly looks forward in ensuring that our workers and businesses will continue having opportunities to make it in america long into the future. this is not about today. it is not about tomorrow. it is about the next year, the next 10 years, the next generation. that is what this bill is about. i plead with my colleagues, do not reject this bill based on a political perception of it. mr. speaker, i again thank chairwoman eddie bernice johnson for her leadership on the house's similar legislation, as well as all the members who had policies that were incorporated into this bill. today, we have a chance to deliver our promise to enact a major priority from president biden's economic agenda, and i would suggest a major economic agenda of republicans in the united states senate, as articulated by the chairman of the senate committee on commerce, science, and transportation. i hope some across the aisle will still vote for this bill as their republican colleagues in the senate did and as they had signaled they would do for a long time. the politics changed, but the challenge we have has not, and the reality has not. let us not lose this opportunity. it is disappointing that some in this house have decided to whip against this bill because of its leadership's opposition to the agreement announced yesterday in the senate to move forward with the inflation reduction act. whether you like that bill or not, do not pay the price of this bill. do not pay the price of setting our competition with others aside. one would hope that all of us would be both for investment in american competitiveness and for reducing inflation and the deficit. sadly, that seems not to be the case. nevertheless, i hope we will have a bipartisan vote today on this bill. let us come together to make our supply chain stronger, protect our national security, invest in our innovation-driven economy, and advantage american workers so they can make it in america. mr. speaker, i say to my colleagues: we talk about the loyal opposition. the loyal opposition need not be loyal to the other party. it does need to be loyal to the country. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. kelly). mr. kelly of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i thank my friend from oklahoma for yielding. mr. speaker, the distinguished leader was exactly right in his comments, but i would just like people to think about something. every single problem we face today globally emanated right here, from this same floor. tax policy, regulation policy, drove most of these businesses offshore. they did not leave because they did not like america. they left because it looked like america did not like them. [[page h7380]] we have seen the erosion of so much of what it is that we are, all because of policy that emanated right from this same floor. now, we are trying to do something to correct bad policy in the past. i am in the automobile business. we cannot finish building cars because we do not have the product necessary to finish them. most of the people we talk to said we did not leave america by choice. we were forced offshore by policy. the speaker and i know this because we are big fans of the steel business. the only thing i would ask my friends on this side and my colleagues on the other side, there are consequences for past performance. this bill in no way is perfect, and mr. hoyer is exactly correct about that. but the question is: what is it that we are trying to fix, and whose problem is it? the answer is: it is our problem because it is happening in real time on our watch. we have to do something. doing nothing is not the answer to how we fix this bad situation. but we cannot do everything from the house. we have to rely on the senate to participate. then, we look at what we had initially started and say: what did they do to the piece that we were trying to get done? listen, i know the debate can get heated. we can talk about how patriotic we are, and we can talk about what the future is not only for ourselves but for our children and our grandchildren and our great- grandchildren. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. mr. kelly of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i suggest that all of us need to take a good long look in the mirror and see who it is that can change the future. there is no sense in talking about what happened in the past. the past is the past, and we cannot reclaim it. we can just deal with it. we have a huge problem on our hands today because we have allowed the technology to leave; we have allowed the production to leave; we have allowed the product to leave; and then we come back and say now we have to do something to get it back. this may be the bill that does that. i do not know. i know from certain states, this is a must-have for some of our colleagues. it is a must-have for us to remain competitive. we are in a global economy. i can tell you this: i wish this was the same bill that we had proposed back when general motors was facing bankruptcy because we know this body--not us, we were not here--lent them the money to stay alive, and they paid it all back in full with interest. this is not that same process, and that is why we are so caught, trying to figure out what we should do to face this part of the business. what can we do here? the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has again expired. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. mr. kelly of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, it comes down to this: we are not republicans, democrats, libertarians, or independents in this house. we are truly the american people. it is up to us to fix problems that are bad, even if we started them ourselves. i just hope that all of our colleagues sit back and take a long look at what is being proposed today and try to figure out, not for themselves but for the people they represent--and most of us represent three-quarters of a million people--what is in the best interest of the people you represent, what is in the best interest of the nation that you live in, and what is in the best interest of the future of america. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from oregon (ms. bonamici). ms. bonamici. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of the chips and science act, and i thank chairwoman johnson for her leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today. the pandemic has underscored how important our domestic semiconductor supply chain is to transportation, the energy sector, national security, and scientific advancement. with this bill, we will make a vital investment in domestic manufacturing and in workers in oregon and across the country. i am also grateful that this legislation includes two of my bipartisan bills. i am the co-chair of the house oceans caucus, and my coastal and ocean acidification research and innovation act will help protect the health of our ocean while supporting coastal resiliency. acidification of the ocean and estuaries destabilizes coastal communities, causing long-term economic harm. this bill will strengthen investments in research and monitoring, provide resources to mitigate, and increase our understanding of the socioeconomic consequences of inaction. my building steam education act will expand resources and grant opportunities to integrate art and design into stem education programs, which will better engage students, prepare an innovative workforce full of creative and critical thinkers, and enhance the diversity of the stem workforce. overall, mr. speaker, the chips and science act will grow u.s. leadership, strengthen our scientific enterprise, bolster research and development, grow our domestic semiconductor manufacturing base, and on-shore critical supply chains. importantly, it will also support workers and create many quality jobs in oregon and across the country. i thank the tireless committee staff for all of their work to bring this bill to the floor today. mr. speaker, i strongly urge all of my colleagues to put american leadership above politics and support this important bipartisan bill. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from new york (mr. tonko) will control the remaining time. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i have no additional speakers, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i yield myself 2 minutes. mr. speaker, i am excited to advance this legislation that will ensure our nation's economic growth and security for generations to come. it is a major response to and a solution for inflation. for over 30 years, our nation's share of global semiconductor manufacturing has steadily declined--declined to dangerously low levels. this technology powers our cars, phones, and critical infrastructure like traffic lights and military communications. the global chip shortage is not only a national security concern, but it continues to drive inflation when industries cannot secure the chips necessary to get their products to market. this chips and science act tackles two pressing issues of the day: strengthening u.s. competitiveness and lowering costs for consumers. i am proud of the role the house has played in the development of this legislation, the tireless work in the house that has secured meaningful guardrails that would prevent companies from investing in our overseas competitors and funds from being used for stock buybacks. these are very critical improvements. i also thank chair johnson and the house committee on science, space, and technology for their work on division b of this package to support much-needed boosts to united states research and development. this includes the bipartisan micro act, which complements chips funding by accelerating microelectronics research at the department of energy. i recognize ben kallen of the committee on science, space, and technology staff and darian harbeck of my staff for their hard work to develop and enact this critical legislation. now is the time to recommit to boldly and strategically investing in our nation's future to promote america's economic strength, the well- being of our communities, our national security, and our leadership around the world. this transformative legislation will indeed ensure that america can out-compete any nation for decades to come. let us fight inflation, let us grow jobs, let us make certain that we respond fully to the needs of the day. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from michigan (mrs. dingell). mrs. dingell. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of the chips and science act. [[page h7381]] semiconductor chips help power nearly every sector of our economy, and i have witnessed firsthand how the global chip shortage has led to idle plants and layoffs and continues to hurt the auto industry, union workers, and our nation's competitiveness by the hour. the reality is that we need to make more chips, and we need to make them in america. we are at an inflection point where we can and must cement u.s. leadership and keep america at the forefront of innovation and technology. the chips and science act will support long-term investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing, including $2 billion for mature- node semiconductor chips that are critical for the automotive industry, advance research and development, and create good-paying american jobs. these provisions will assist in revitalizing our states' economies that have been constrained by supply chain vulnerabilities, reducing production and driving up prices. this is not just a manufacturing jobs issue, but it is also of vital importance to our national security. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. {time} 1400 mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i am prepared to close whenever it is appropriate, so i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from rhode island (mr. cicilline). mr. cicilline. mr. speaker, the outsourcing of american manufacturing jobs has not only resulted in job losses and lower wages at home, it is threatening america's standing as an economic superpower on the global stage. the chips and science act is the bold action we need to maintain our global standing and provide a strong economic future for american families, small businesses, and workers. critically, this legislation includes an estimated $1.8 billion for the national science foundation's established program to stimulate competitive research, also known as epscor, a critical program that funds cutting-edge scientific research in smaller states like rhode island with historically underfunded academic communities. drawing on the talent, knowledge, and perspectives of academic institutions from every state, no matter how small, helps maintain our competitive edge in scientific advancement. with this and the other investments made in this legislation, we will boost our domestic manufacturing capabilities and supply chains, end our dangerous dependence on foreign manufacturers, advance u.s. scientific research, lower costs for american consumers, and create 100,000 new, good-paying jobs. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from indiana (mr. mrvan). mr. mrvan. mr. speaker, i thank the chair for the time. mr. speaker, i rise today to express my support and appreciation that the house is considering the chips and science act. indiana's first congressional district is home to an incredible manufacturing, steel, and industrial workforce. this legislation takes historic action to shorten supply chains, increase the production of american-made semiconductors, and protect our national security. i thank my senate colleague from indiana, senator todd young, for his steadfast leadership on this initiative. today is a good day for northwest indiana and the state of indiana. this bipartisan legislation is an investment in research, technology, and stem. it allows us to be in enhanced global competitiveness. it makes us less reliant on other countries for chips and semiconductors. it invests in the american worker and ingenuity. it allows for our autoworkers to complete production without stoppages. it allows for continuity for our steel industry and steelworkers and productivity, and it strengthens our nation's security. it creates an opportunity for indiana in a bipartisan congressional manner and the delegation to come together to compete for a tech hub, and it creates a future for the next generation of workers. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this agreement, and i thank the chair, again, for my time. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from new mexico (ms. stansbury). ms. stansbury. mr. speaker, i rise today to celebrate the brilliant and boundless minds of our scientists, our innovators, and our young people in new mexico and across the united states. there is a lot to say about the chips bill that is so crucial for our economy, our national security, and for innovation in our country. but today i want to celebrate our innovators and talk about the crucial importance of passing this bill. this bill has particular meaning for me as it includes my very first piece of legislation that i filed upon taking office last year which is the bipartisan partnerships for energy security and innovation act. i thank the chairwoman, her staff, and the leadership for making it possible and our state's very own senator ben ray lujan who has led this legislation for years. this bill leans into our state's economic strengths and will take our stem economy to new heights. it will help to create a nonprofit foundation associated with the department of energy to harness the knowledge and innovation of our national labs, our universities, our tribal colleges, and our hbcus and hispanic-serving institutions to solve our challenges at the highest levels. mr. speaker, i thank, again, the leadership and say: let us get this bill across the finish line, and let us build it in america. mr. lucas. i continue to reserve the balance of my time, mr. speaker. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. lamb). mr. lamb. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this bill not only for the important semiconductor provisions but for some of the provisions that are less noticed, including the text of the super act authored by representative gonzalez of ohio and me which focuses on how to get the carbon emissions out of steelmaking. it is often the people from steelmaking parts of the country who stand up in support of provisions like this, but this is important for every american. every american uses 600 pounds of steel every single year. if you think about the roads you drive on, the bridges and buildings you enter, your own car, and your own house, mr. speaker, it starts to add up. there is nowhere in the world that they make this steel without emitting more co 2 into the atmosphere. somewhere someone in the world is going to figure out how to do that. if we do it here in the united states--we are already emitting less than everybody else-- but if we can get it to zero, then we will have a product that everyone in the world is looking for and is crucial to our future. this bill will help us do that. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. ryan). mr. ryan. september 19, 1977, black monday is when all the steel mills closed in youngstown, ohio, and we have been waiting since then for a transformational investment into the state of ohio. this bill is going to allow intel to come to ohio and convert a $20 billion deal into a $100 billion deal: 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time jobs with an average wage of $135,000 per year. it is going to transform the industrial midwest. it is going to allow us to out- compete china. this is also a national security issue. young people who have been leaving ohio for generations are going to be able to come back. this is an unbelievable bill. this is the first step towards an industrial policy in the united states of america, and it is time for us to quit the politics, stop trying to score political points, stop putting party over country, and lay down our arms. my god, if we cannot agree on this, what in the hell are we going to agree on? [[page h7382]] rebuilding the manufacturing base? good-paying jobs? union construction? out-competing china? national security? come on. let us do this. let us do it together. but we have a small group of people who have hijacked the republican party, and the leadership in this house on the republican side is more concerned with defeating democrats than doing something that is best for the united states of america. we just saw it in the senate with the burn pits legislation, and we are seeing it here with the chips legislation: party over country. so july 28, 2022, is going to be black thursday--the day the republican party has been hijacked and aligned themselves with communist china. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. higgins). mr. higgins of louisiana. mr. speaker, i will tell my colleague what we can agree on in the hallowed halls of this chamber. we can and should agree that men of principle do not intend to build the future of our republic upon backroom deals in the dark of night in the upper chamber of our bicameral congress, which is exactly what happened with this bill, which is why it is now strongly opposed by my colleagues in the republican party. everything we do here to advance the future of america should be based upon the core principles that gave birth to america. perhaps my colleague could agree with me upon that. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). ms. jackson lee. sadly, though, this is called the chips and science act, it left out the calculation of math for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. america is applauding. for once they will not be stopped and stymied by a supply chain that says: no technology, no cars, stay forever without wheels when you have a driving business. this bill is expected to create 100,000 jobs. i am excited, in particular, about the addition of nasa's reauthorization and to specifically note that nasa's johnson space center will be doing the orion program funded, gateway program funded, extravehicular activity in human surface mobility funded. orion, gateway and ehp funded. these are individual programs that we funded for one of the most prominent centers there. in addition, we are going to move to manufacturing chips in this nation, including houston. the democratic republic of the congo has precious metals. where do they want to send them? to the united states of america. they want us to produce. they want us to be able to transport. out of this bill with the amazing amount of research coming forward in science it is going to be a testimony. i want to pay tribute to congresswoman eddie bernice johnson, the chairwoman who guided this with the kind of calm and expertise that has brought us to this point. texas is proud, the nation is proud, and 100,000 jobs and over $3 billion that will be provided in energy alone, $10.9 billion for the office of science, $7.5 billion for fy22, a 6 percent annual increase. this is a jobs bill. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 4346, the chips and science act, which comes as a result of bipartisan bicameral work following the passage of the competes act and the william m. (mac) thornberry national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2021. chips' authorization was part of the william m. (mac) thornberry national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2021. which authorized the department of commerce (doc), department of defense (dod), and department of state (dos) to engage in activities to develop onshore domestic manufacturing of semiconductors critical to u.s. competitiveness and national security. this bill is expected to create nearly 100,000 new american jobs. and provisions in the bill are reflecting my legislation. i am proud to say that many of those jobs would be housed in texas. currently, more than 30,000 texans work in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips. in fact, for the last 11 years, my state has been the country's number one top exporter of this product. there are opportunities in addressing the necessity of finding and refining of rare earth-critical mineral elements that are needed to manufacture technology in every aspect of the economy. i will be hosting a major energy discussion and a series of meetings in september and october to focus on closing the gap between u.s. demand for these materials and the supply available to us in the global marketplace. i believe that our nation's independence and competitiveness is on the line if we do not solve this problem. on september 12, 1962, president kennedy gave a speech at rice university that outlined the task he was given to the nation's best and brightest scientists by saying: ``we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept. one we are unwilling to postpone.'' our nation has never measured itself by the progress of other nations, but by the boundlessness of our imagination that we work to make real. before the race to the moon, the united states had conquered other science, engineering, and technological challenges like the building of the panama canal and human flight. we know the fruit of this labor is greater knowledge, innovations, the unlocking of new knowledge, and the dispelling or confirmation of scientific proofs. as a member of the bipartisan space and aeronautics caucus, i am in support of the nasa authorization that is included in this bill. i am a sponsor h.r. 5260, the advancing human spaceflight act of 2021, a bill establishing programs and policies pertaining to human presence in space. this bill would establish a program to develop next-generation space suits and associated technologies, establish an outpost in orbit around the moon as described in this bill, and submit a plan for achieving a power supply on the moon. the bill declares that it is u.s. policy to continuously maintain the capability for a continuous human presence in low-earth orbit through and beyond the useful life of the international space station (iss) and that such capability shall maintain u.s. global leadership and relations with partners and allies, contribute to the general welfare of the united states, and leverage commercial capabilities to promote affordability so as not to preclude a robust portfolio of other human space exploration activities. i am also a cosponsor of h.r. 869, the research investment to spark the economy act of 2021 or the rise act of 2021, a bill that authorizes the departments of agriculture, commerce, defense, education, energy, the interior, health and human services, and transportation, national aeronautics and space administration (nasa), national science foundation, and environmental protection agency to provide support for research regarding covid-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) or research disrupted by the covid-19 pandemic. the bill provides supplemental funding to extend the duration of a grant to a research institution, national laboratory, or individual that was awarded prior to the enactment of this bill, or to expand the purposes of such a grant as specified; issue awards to research the effects of the current pandemic and potential future pandemics; and provide flexibility on awards to account for facility closures or other limitations during the covid-19 public health emergency. h.r. 4346, the chips and science act bill before us today, includes national aeronautics and space administration authorization for the: artemis moon program; moon-to-mars exploration campaign, including the artemis program to return america to the moon; maintenance of the international space station. extension of authorization for the international space station through 2030 and establishes priorities for research, as required to bring americans to mars; extend nasa enhanced use lease authority. enables nasa to lease underutilized; prioritization through 2032, and to use lease revenues to address facility maintenance while reducing taxpayer costs; goal of including earth science observations and the search for life beyond earth; advancement of u.s. aeronautics leadership enhancement of nasa technology, infrastructure, and workforce; and focused attention that ensures planetary defense against meteors and large asteroids. i have long held an intense interest in the nation's premier space exploration agency, first as a member of the house science committee and now as a member of the house committee on homeland security. [[page h7383]] from space exploration to climate change the work of congress is needed now more than ever before. i have for several congresses offered an amendment to the ndaa to provide congress with a report on the issue of space debris, which jeopardizes human space exploration. these objects are a product of earlier space exploration when there were only a few nations capable of low earth orbit space flight. today, public-private partnerships and collaboration is bringing the commercial sector into space exploration. the space debris amendment brings valuable insight into the challenges, dangers, and opportunities present by addressing space debris moving over 17,000 miles an hour and the real changes of debris disabling or damaging manmade space exploration or development efforts. president kennedy knew what was on the line if our nation did not dominate the space race. because he understood what was at stake he set the nation's sights on people walking on the surface of the moon, and to safely return home required technology, materials, metals, food preservation, clothing, and instruments that had not been invented at the time of his speech this was a monumental challenge that captivated and motivated americans--all americans to find within themselves the talent, courage, and fortitude needed to make his words our nation's greatest scientific accomplishment. he said his challenge was an act of faith and vision because no one know what would come from the effort of accomplishing the challenge of conquering space. the speech at rice university is located in the city of houston because of the concentration of engineering, researchers, and academic institutions doing cutting-edge work in the energy sector of the economy. first established as the manned spacecraft center (msc) in 1961, it was later named the lyndon b. johnson space center (jsc) in honor of the late president. the jsc is responsible for the design, development, and operation of human space flight. for more than four decades, jsc has been the world leader in human space flight operations for nasa. the critical thing to understand about what jsc means to human space flight is to understand the importance of a critical mass of experts that are working collaboratively from the training of astronauts to all aspects of the support during missions. the center's famed mission control center, or mcc, has been the operational hub of every american human space mission for over 40 years since gemini iv. the mcc manages all activity onboard the space station and directs all space shuttle missions, including station assembly flights and hubble space telescope servicing. construction of the control center began in late 1962. in addition to conducting mission simulations and operations with flight controllers, space was allocated for key nasa engineering and scientific personnel along with representatives of the major contractors to support each mission. this increased presence strengthened the problem-solving capabilities of the mcc team. today, jcs is comprised of a complex of 100 buildings constructed on 1,620 acres that is known as space city. houston is where the johnson space center was born and remains to this day--a place of boundless imagination in the pursuit of new horizons in space exploration. there are approximately 3,200 civil servants, including 110 astronauts, employed at johnson space center, and a contract workforce of over 15,000 are the people who prepare people for space missions. this bill is a matter of national pride, national economic innovation, and most importantly, national security. i want to note for congress and the nation that the jsc with continuing to serve a vital role in the next chapter of space exploration for our nation. several essential nasa programs are authorized and fully funded separately under this authorization bill. the bill provides funding for each of the essential tasks that nasa has for the jsc: the orion gateway program is funded separately, extravehicular activity is funded separately, and human surface mobility (ehp) program is funded separately. the authorization language in this bill makes clear that the orion gateway program, extravehicular activity, and human surface mobility (ehp) program are assigned to the johnson space center. language in this bill also provides clarity that all new lunar and mars samples are under the purview of the jsc. this is a wise decision given that the jsc maintains over 5 decades of experience and expertise in the stewardship and curation of all current collections of nasa-held astro-materials. all u.s. government or u.s. government contracted services involving extraterrestrial material or astro-materials such as, but not limited to rocks, dust, minerals, meteorites, regolith, ices, organic matter, gasses, and atoms, and including samples collected in space, on other solar system bodies, and on earth will be curated and managed by johnson space center. nasa's johnson space center shall curate and manage all nasa-held astro-material sample collections, including providing loans of astro- material specimens, review of the proposed use, approval of research investigations, education, and public display. these are nasa johnson space center human exploration programs that are a part of moon to mars or artemis, all funded separately in this bill. they are: orion program; gateway program--referred to in the bill as ``an outpost in orbit around the moon''; extravehicular activity and human surface mobility (ehp) program--in the bill ``spacesuits'' are called out and state any other elements needed to meet the requirement of the moon to mars program; and orion, gateway, and ehp (suits and mobile systems, rovers), all are critical programs. just as the moon project was a massive endeavor that would touch nearly every aspect of our nation's scientific community and efforts so will the work outlined by this legislation. the chips act would invest $52 billion in domestic semiconductor chip manufacturing, and various vital science initiatives to return the united states to its role as the preeminent leader in science and modernization. these initiatives include efforts to expand diversity and equity in stem fields by combatting sexual harassment in science workplaces, investing in minority-serving institutions, and expanding fellowship and scholarship opportunities for women in stem. it would also focus on scientific initiatives for biological and environmental research that would accelerate the growth of clean energy commercialization and development across the country. everything from helium conservation to nuclear physics, to biological threat preparedness, is included in this bill. additionally, the chips and science act are authorizations for incredibly important innovations happening at nasa. it would authorize the artemis moon program to work towards the goal of returning american astronauts to the moon, including sending the first woman and person of color. in addition to resuming goals of lunar landings, the chips and science act would prioritize the research necessary to continue the orion program and bring americans to mars. several essential nasa programs are authorized and fully funded separately under this authorization bill. the orion program gateway program is funded separately; extravehicular activity is funded separately and human surface mobility (ehp) program is funded separately. the authorization language in this bill makes clear that the orion gateway program, extravehicular activity, and human surface mobility (ehp) program are assigned to the johnson space center. language in this bill also provides clarification that all new lunar and mars samples are the responsibility of the johnson space center. the other priority i believe should have been included in this bill is a clarification that nasa's johnson space center with over 5 decades of experience and expertise in the stewardship and curation of all current collections of nasa-held astro-materials should continue in this role for the materials that will be brought back from the moon and mars to earth for study. further, it would have served the mission to make sure that all u.s. government or u.s. government contracted services involving extraterrestrial material or astro-materials such as but not limited to rocks, dust, minerals, meteorites, regolith, ices, organic matter, gasses, and atoms and including samples collected in space, on other solar systems bodies and earth should be curated and managed by johnson space center. nasa's johnson space center should be charged with the management of all nasa-held astro-material sample collections, including providing loans of astro-material specimens, review of the proposed use, approval of research investigations, education, and public display. i will support the bill, and pledge to continue to work with my colleagues in the house and members of the senate to make sure that the jsc's role in the next chapter of our nation's space exploration includes management of materials returned to earth for study. [[page h7384]] in addition to its many improvements to stem workforce growth and scientific research and development, this bill has a particular focus on america's need for a robust push in semiconductor chip manufacturing. much of the funding in h.r. 4346 would be dedicated to building the capacity of the american semiconductor chip industry. this bill would set aside resources designed to incentivize the construction of potentially 7 to 10 domestic semiconductor fabrication plants. these plants would be responsible for manufacturing the core of all our modern electronics. cars, cell phones, air conditioning units, microwave ovens, medical tools, and laptops all rely on semiconductor chips to transport, connect, feed, and support the american public. the chips act would ensure that american consumers retain access to these products during times of international instability. the united states' ability to manufacture semiconductor chips has been on a steady decline for decades. in 1990, the u.s. met roughly 40 percent of the world's semiconductor chip capacity. in 2020, that fell to just 12 percent. east asian countries like china, taiwan, korea, and japan are now home to nearly 80 percent of global chip fabrication. some of america's largest tech firms, including google, apple, and amazon, rely on a single taiwanese manufacturer, tsmc, for nearly 90 percent of their chip production. i have long advanced that chip manufacturing should be domestic because of the critical importance to telecommunication, medical, transportation, national defense, industrial control systems, and financial systems. the covid-19 pandemic made evident the limitations of domestic manufacturing capacity in the united states and vulnerabilities in global supply chains. during the pandemic, our healthcare centers, schools, and other vital industries struggled to import the technological goods they needed to battle the virus, educate our children, and keep our economy running. thousands of american people died in hospital beds while hospitals struggled to obtain additional ventilators, oxygen monitors and other necessary medical equipment--medical equipment that rely on semiconductor chips to work. delays in supply chains and manufacturing capabilities undoubtedly wasted time and cost countless lives. this cannot happen again. the 21st-century world is only able to stay upright through a careful scaffolding of electronic and computer products. there are some products that we must maintain the ability to produce upon demand to meet domestic need. with russia at war with ukraine and an uncertain future for chinese and taiwanese relations, it is more imperative than ever that the manufacturing of semiconductor chips returns to american soil, american businesses, and american control. with the passage of the chips act, the united states would rise again to its status as a world leader in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips. doing so is an economic and national security necessity. for years, the united states has neglected to invest in semiconductor manufacturing. meanwhile, china has invested $150 billion to build its domestic capacity. if we do not invest in the future of american innovation and excellence now, we are sure to fall behind our east asian competitors in the future--at the expense of the american people. in addition to the provision of funding for manufacturing facilities, the chips act includes about $100 billion for the research and development of secure semiconductors and secure microelectronic supply chains. this would include the creation of a subcommittee on microelectronics leadership which would be tasked with developing a national strategy for the creation of a robust microelectronics industry in the united states and setting priorities for the maintenance of american leadership in advanced chip design and production. this is our opportunity to secure the economic and national security of our nation. it is our opportunity to provide much-needed jobs and industry. it is our opportunity to return the united states of america to its position of prominence and example as a world leader in innovation and manufacturing. made in america is good for business, it is good for security, and it is good for our people. that is why i wholeheartedly support the passage of the chips and science act of 2022. i include in the record a list of nasa bills i have sponsored and cosponsored. 1. h.r. 5250--117th congress (2021-2022) advancing human spaceflight act of 2021 sponsor: rep. garcia, sylvia r.

chair reminds all members to please heed the gavel. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from ohio (mrs. beatty). mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, i thank chairwoman johnson for yielding. let me just take point of personal privilege as a member of this house and salute the gentlewoman for her leadership, her experience, and the years that she has given to this congress. i do not care what any colleague says on the other side of the aisle. today, because of the gentlewoman's leadership and all others on this end--some on the other side--understand that this is about national security, understand that this is about our economy, and understand that this is about our workforce. i am so proud to be from the great state of ohio. it will be a game- changer with tens of billions of dollars being invested into what may end up as the largest semiconductor manufacturing plant in the world. i will tell you, mr. speaker, that democrats will stand strong because we understand the difference from politics and posturing and making a difference in industries that we all use and need. mr. speaker, i am asking all of my delegation, democrats and republicans, to stand up for what is right and vote for this bill. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from ohio. mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, let me also end by saying that this bill will set a path that the united states will be a leader in the economy for the future. i have listened repeatedly to members on the other side of the aisle talk about inflation, talk about investment, and talk about economics. now i want them to vote that way. i want them to join us and support this bill that will make a difference for not only now but for our future and set us up ahead of other countries that have done damage to us. mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, may i ask how much time i have remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentlewoman from texas has 3\1/2\ minutes remaining. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i have no more requests for time, and i am prepared to close. {time} 1415 mr. lucas. mr. speaker, i have no additional speakers and i, too, am prepared to close. i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, as i said in my opening remarks, i am deeply disappointed by the process that led us here, especially over the last 24 hours. had democratic leadership acted in good faith, we would be having a very different discussion today. i would prefer that our bipartisan strategic competitiveness policy had not been tied to the partisan and divisive reconciliation legislation. but it would be dishonest to pretend that that has not been the case. and after long and careful thought for what reconciliation will mean to the economy, the expanded government, and the american people, i cannot, in good conscience, vote for the $52 [[page h7386]] billion in mandatory spending; while knowing that hundreds of billions in taxes and partisan spending are about to bulldoze us. we know the numbers, but it is worth repeating them because they are more than numbers. as someone who studied economics, i am very cognizant that these are, in fact, a representation of the daily life for families across america. inflation has skyrocketed to 9.1 percent. every dollar in your wallets, in your paycheck, in your retirement account, every dollar is now worth less. the next set of numbers is 1.6 and 0.9. those are the most recent declines in our gross domestic product, gdp. while my friends on the other side of the aisle want to debate the definition of recession, let us put that nitpicking aside and step back for a moment and consider the big picture, what this means for americans. our economic growth is slowing. our inflation is rising. our job growth is tapering off. americans are unquestionably worse off now than they were a year ago; and that is what i have to consider when casting today's vote. what we need right now is policy to make our economy stronger and more competitive; not backroom deals that increase taxes on businesses and raise government spending. as i said at the start of this debate, i am incredibly proud of the work the house science, space, and technology committee has done to create thoughtful, strategic, sustainable science and technology policy. i am grateful to chairwoman johnson, to the republican and democrat members of the science committee, and to all the staffers who worked to advance this legislation. while others may try to take credit, the truth is division b was primarily developed and written by our committee, which has been working on this issue for longer than anyone on the hill. i would like very much to cast my vote in support of our research and development policies, but i cannot ignore the consequences of doing so, alongside a deeply flawed reconciliation package. i owe it to my constituents to vote in their best interests. and today, that means voting against the legislation i have long supported. i will conclude with this: i believe the bipartisan leadership of the house science, space, and technology committee represents the best that congress can be when we work together in a transparent fashion to come to agreements that serve the american people. i believe that actions taken by democratic leadership yesterday are a sad example of the dysfunction that plagues congress when we ignore these details. i am deeply disappointed in this process. even with all my admiration for my chairwoman, and all the respect for our mutual members and our staffs, even with all that, mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. i would simply like to say in closing that when we pass up an opportunity that we have like today in this bill, where we are looking out for our scientific enterprise, looking out for our space exploration and chip manufacturing, which will drive our future, we simply will be closing the door to our future to turn any of this down. we cannot be competitive in the world without adequate research and adequate assistance to keep our research enterprise growing strongly. i am not willing to give up this opportunity and close the door on my nation. and i simply would ask all the people who possibly can, not to think about the bill that was passed or going to pass in the senate yesterday, or last night, but think about the importance of keeping the doors and opportunities open for our nation and having the jobs and talent right here in the united states. it is bigger than all of us. we were sent here to look out for our nation, and this is a measure that will do that. so i simply plead with everyone who can possibly see the future, or even dream about the future, to vote for this measure. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 4346, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. soto. mr. speaker, i want to commend the authors of the chips act of 2022 for including $52.7 billion to incentivize investments and continued american leadership in semiconductor manufacturing to help address supply chain disruptions and ensure that more semiconductors are produced here at home. currently, only 12 percent of chips are manufactured domestically, compared to 37 percent in the 1990s. the chips act of 2022 will ensure the congressional goal of promoting domestic competitiveness and the act also includes safeguards to ensure that recipients of federal funds from these programs cannot build advanced semiconductor production facilities in countries that present a national security concern. within my central florida district is the neocity technology campus which is recognized as an emerging microelectronics manufacturing and advanced packaging hub, that has already made synergies with institutions of higher education across florida and key partnerships with the u.s. department of defense and u.s. department of commerce. neocity is home to bridg, a not for-profit, public-private partnership specializing in domestic semiconductor research, advanced packaging, and manufacturing. imec, a world-renowned international research and development organization active in semiconductor design and architecture. suss microtec and tel, leading suppliers of equipment and process solutions for the semiconductor industry. and sky water technology, the only u.s. owned and operated pure play trusted foundry, that works on leading edge advanced packaging technology. they all work in collaboration out of the center for neovation, one of the most state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing facilities in the western hemisphere. as envisioned by this important legislation, the facilities, and experts at bridg, imec, suss microtec, tel, and sky water technology offer immediate capability to accelerate u.s. production of critical semiconductor chips, strengthen the domestic supply chain so chips are made in america, and turbocharge our research capacity. equally as important, the neocity academy, a public stem magnet high school, is training the leaders of tomorrow's science and technology workforce. i am proud of the work being undertaken in my district to support domestic semiconductor manufacturing technology development as they work to address the supply chain. i look forward to working with the administration and the u.s. department of commerce on implementation of the chips for america fund. additionally, i appreciate the inclusion of two provisions that i submitted that were included in the final passage, one amendment and one standalone bill. one competes act amendment was included to extend non-profits to be included in chips funding. specifically, the provision adds nonprofits to the definition of ``covered entities'' to expand the semiconductor incentive program to include nonprofit entities, which clarifies that non-profit entities like the 501(c)(3) fatalities in neocity are also eligible for funding under the semiconductor incentive program. finally, i appreciate the inclusion of a standalone bill, h.r. 8545, that requires the director of the office of science and technology policy to establish a blockchain and cryptocurrencies advisory specialist position within the office to advise the president on matters related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. ostp advises the president and others within the executive office of the president on the scientific, engineering, and technological aspects of the economy, national security, homeland security, health, foreign relations, and the environment. it is critical to create such a position within ostp to ensure there is a policy expert. mr. beyer. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of the chips and science act. as a member of the science, space, and technology committee and as chair of the space and aeronautics subcommittee, i could not be more thrilled to pass this historic bill today. the bill makes transformational new investments in research, innovation, and american manufacturing, which will bolster our leadership across the globe. i want to take a moment to highlight some of the specific provisions that i championed along the way. the chips and science act includes my national secure data service act, which will create a pilot program at the national science foundation to test different approaches on how we can link government-wide data. right now, the lack of coordination across the federal government's data infrastructure limits the ability to generate timely information that is needed to promote evidence-based policymaking. another provision i am thrilled with is the inclusion of the doe science for the future act. this provision includes a massive investment into our fusion energy r&d enterprise. we are on the cusp of bringing fusion energy to the grid in the next decade and i am so excited that this bill will bolster our research and efforts on it at doe. finally, i am over the moon (pun intended) about the inclusion of a nasa authorization in the final package. [[page h7387]] congress has not authorized nasa since 2017, and this has been my number one priority since taking over the chairmanship of the space and aeronautics subcommittee last year. the bill authorizes key programs at nasa including artemis, iss extension, sustainable aviation, space nuclear systems, and many science missions. it also contains my cleaner, quieter airplanes act and nasa enhanced use leasing act--both huge wins for nasa and our communities. simply put, the chips and science act will be a huge boon to our nation's leadership in key areas and i am so looking forward to voting a resounding yes. the speaker pro tempore. all time for debate has expired. pursuant to house resolution 1289, the previous question is ordered. the question is on the motion by the gentlewoman
