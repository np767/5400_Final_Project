there was no objection. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, the legislation before us today is a big deal for american families and a big deal for our planet. the inflation reduction act will lower healthcare costs and energy costs for american families. it will allow medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices and cap drug costs for seniors, saving many medicare beneficiaries hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars each year. this legislation finally makes the biggest corporations start paying their fair share in taxes, and it ensures that rich tax cheats start paying what they owe. the inflation reduction act is fiscally responsible, fully paid for, and has been strongly endorsed by top u.s. economists across the political spectrum. not one american family making less than $400,000 a year will see their federal tax bill increased by this legislation, not by a penny. the inflation reduction act is also the biggest investment the u.s. government has ever made to combat climate change. it leapfrogs us ahead of nearly every other country in terms of our commitment to tackling this crisis. now, we have seen a lot of republicans spreading misinformation about this legislation, and it is for one reason and one reason only: they are scared. they know the provisions of this bill are overwhelmingly popular, yet because they consider it a democratic bill, every single one of them will be voting against it. this is a crystal-clear example of republicans putting party before country. just look at the numbers. mr. speaker, 77 percent of americans support placing caps on prescription drug prices to lower healthcare costs. that is a key component of this bill. mr. speaker, 83 percent of americans support allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices to make healthcare more affordable. that is another key component of this bill. two-thirds of americans think the government should do more to combat climate change. this bill takes on climate change with the urgency it deserves. by opposing this bill, republicans are making it very clear where they stand: not with the american people, not with their priorities or needs, but with big pharma, with corporate lobbyists, with tax cheats. the american people are on our side. they want this bill. today, in a huge victory for them, we will send it to the president's desk to be signed into law. let me remind my republican colleagues what they are voting against. they are voting against cutting prescription drug prices for their constituents--in many cases, for lifesaving medication. they are voting against combating inflation and lowering energy costs when american families are desperate for us to take action. they are voting against providing the largest federal investment ever to combat the climate crisis and its life-threatening consequences. i could not be more proud that i will not only be voting ``yes'' on this bill but that this historic legislation will bear my name. with or without republican support, today, we will make a real difference. we will use the power of the federal government to make american lives better and our country and planet safer. in other words, we will do our job. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, before i begin, i will take a moment to recognize our colleague, jackie walorski. we come back to the capitol with very heavy hearts. just over a week ago, we lost jackie and two of her staffers, emma thomson and zachery potts, while they were in their public service. i was lucky enough to serve with jackie on the ways and means committee and worked with her numerous hours. i know that the ways and means committee will miss her dearly. the people of this body will miss her dearly. i know that the people of indiana will miss her very dearly. mr. speaker, i will say that jackie was one of the hardest working public servants that i have ever met, and when she gave you her word, it was written and carved in stone. for that, she will always be in our hearts. mr. speaker, as we turn to the legislation before us today, this week, we found out inflation remains at a 40-year high, having risen 13.7 percent since biden became president. real wages have decreased by 4.5 percent. americans are suffering. are we here debating how to alleviate that suffering? no. we are debating what democrats call the inflation reduction act, which everyone from the congressional budget office to 230 different economists--even senator bernie sanders--says will not actually reduce inflation. {time} 1200 when you strip away the fake sunset policies, this bill spends $745 billion and adds $146 billion to our debt. it adds $54 billion worth of debt just in the first 5 years, and 80 percent of their ``budget deficits'' do not even begin until after the year 2029. so lots of spending up front, lots of debt up front, and then maybe savings 8 years from now. how is that going to put out the fire of inflation when the price of groceries is up 13.1 percent over the past year? senators manchin and schumer, secretary yellen, and former president obama are all on record saying you do not raise taxes during a recession. but that is exactly what this bill does. it includes $599 billion in new taxes and budget gimmicks. half of the tax burden falls on taxpayers making less than $400,000 a year. the choice this bill puts in front of families making less than $200,000 is clear. put the government at the center of your healthcare decisions or face a $10 billion tax burden. but it gets worse. this bill doubles the size of the irs. it doubles the size of the irs, so it can target and audit more middle-class families and snoop into their bank accounts. i am not sure how subjecting americans to more audits solves the inflation crisis. mr. speaker, in my home state of missouri, this bill would quadruple the number of audits, 18,000 more audits on hardworking americans who make less than $200,000 a year. of course, that is not the only point of this bill. this is about democrats' green new deal agenda. my colleagues on the other side will come down here today not to talk [[page h7647]] about inflation, not to talk about gas prices but to instead talk about the hundreds of billions of dollars that is being spent on radical environmental projects. and you know what, they will be exactly right. half of the spending--over $400 billion--goes to things like: $3.4 billion for tree equity. tree equity, that surely is going to bring down gas prices; $7.5 billion for new luxury electric vehicles in tax credits for families who make up to $300,000 a year. that should definitely curtail inflation; $27 billion for a national climate bank slush fund at the epa. that should definitely help our supply chain crisis; a $362 million handout to corporate america to make their office buildings much greener. that will definitely help secure our southern border. mr. speaker, democrats believe they can spend their way out of inflation and tax their way out of a recession. it will only make the suffering americans face today that much worse. this bill is simple. it is welfare for the wealthy environmentalists and big corporations, paid for by increased taxes and audits on middle- and low-income taxpayers. these hardworking americans are the ones that have been forgotten under the one-party democrat rule in washington. the washington and wealthy elites win again. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from massachusetts (ms. clark), the assistant speaker. ms. clark of massachusetts. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman for yielding. mr. speaker, this is exactly what the american people need. it lowers costs, it creates great-paying jobs, and it makes our communities safer by addressing the lethal effects of climate change. seniors will not have to choose between putting food on the table and paying for their prescription drugs; more families are going to be able to afford healthcare; homes and cars will be more affordable and efficient; u.s. companies will be able to create great-paying jobs and lead the clean technology revolution; billionaires and corporations will finally have to pay their fair share while working people will have more money in their pockets; costs will be lower, water will be cleaner, green jobs will be plentiful, and our future will be brighter. in every way, this game-changing bill moves america forward. democrats are lowering costs for everyday americans. we are standing up to special interests who have blocked cutting the cost of prescription drugs over and over again and america's critical transition to clean energy. we are rebuilding a stronger, greener economy. we are infusing the tax system with fairness. this is a win for the american public. this is a win for people over politics. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the great state of iowa (mrs. hinson). mrs. hinson. mr. speaker, i rise today in opposition to this so- called inflation reduction act. last year, we warned that spending trillions of dollars would cause prices to spike but democrats did it anyway--ramming through a trillion-dollar washington pork buffet, sticking families with the bill. now, speaker pelosi is arguing for yet another tax-and-spending spree, wasting hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars on green new deal priorities and raising taxes on middle-class families. this will worsen inflation. it sics the irs on hardworking iowans-- adding 87,000 new irs agents to target taxpayers. iowans are begging for us to get prices down, but instead, this bill takes more of their hard-earned paychecks. and for what? so the wealthy can get a discount on their electric vehicles? so we can increase bureaucracy at the epa to impose new regulations on our farmers? mr. speaker, this bill ignores the pain that iowans are feeling. it is the worst policy at the worst possible time. mr. speaker, i urge a ``no'' vote on this latest tax-and-spending spree. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new york (mr. jeffries), the democratic caucus chair, and a distinguished member of the budget committee. mr. jeffries. mr. speaker, i thank the distinguished chair for yielding and for his leadership. mr. speaker, we are once again getting big things done for everyday americans. we passed the american rescue plan, saved the economy, put shots in arms, money in pockets, and kids back in school. we passed the infrastructure investment and jobs act to fix our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good-paying jobs. we passed gun safety legislation for the first time in 30 years that will save lives. we passed the chips and science act that will bring back domestic manufacturing jobs to the united states of america. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of the inflation reduction act, another transformative bill brought to you by your friendly neighborhood democratic party. the inflation reduction act will lower energy costs; confront the climate crisis with the fierce urgency of now; set our planet forward on a sustainable trajectory; lower healthcare costs by strengthening the affordable healthcare act, as well as reducing the deficit by $300 billion, and giving medicare the ability to use its bulk-price purchasing power to drive down the high cost of lifesaving prescription drugs. it is a big f-ing deal. the inflation reduction act is going to dramatically improve the lives of everyday americans. we are putting people over politics. fighting to lower costs for safer communities and better paying jobs. my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, republicans, will oppose this groundbreaking legislation. they would rather defend donald trump than defend the american people. vote ``yes'' on the inflation reduction act so we can continue to put people over politics. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from virginia (mr. cline). mr. cline. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, we know the real story. we know what happened a year and a half ago when the so-called american rescue plan was passed--40-year high inflation rates resulted. we see now what the result is from the build back better plan that had no chance of passage in the senate. this is the offspring of build back better. even bernie sanders, a socialist who can come up with a million flawed excuses to spend your tax dollars, says he cannot find a way to even say this would reduce inflation one iota. we know that instead of fostering american energy independence, increasing purchasing power for the american family, and reducing inflation, this bill includes: $16.5 billion in higher taxes for those making less than $200,000 a year; $38 billion in new taxes on american oil and gas producers, which will be passed along to consumers in the form of even higher costs for heating homes and gas prices, and; $480 billion in tax hikes that will hit workers through slashed wages. half the bill is green new deal climate change special interest funding, including taxpayer-funded subsidies on electric vehicle purchases, and; $80 billion to double the size of the irs, creating an army of new enforcement agents. mr. speaker, i urge a ``no'' vote on this horrible legislation. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from new york (mrs. carolyn b. maloney), the distinguished chair of the committee on oversight and reform. mrs. carolyn b. maloney of new york. mr. speaker, as chair of the committee on oversight and reform, i rise in strong, strong support of the inflation reduction act. my committee conducted a 3-year investigation of prescription drug prices. our findings overwhelmingly support the need for this bill's reforms to curb the drug industry's outrageous pricing practices and make prescription drugs more affordable for patients and taxpayers. [[page h7648]] these reforms include empowering medicare to negotiate prices for certain drugs, a step that is long overdue. my committee's investigation into the fossil fuel industry showed that big oil is refusing to take adequate steps to cut emissions, even though burning fossil fuels is a primary driver of the climate crisis. this bill will finally bring down emissions from fossil fuels, helping our environment. i am proud to have championed other provisions in the bill, including a historic investment of $3 billion to electrify the postal service delivery fleet. this will replace tens of thousands of gas-guzzling trucks with clean, electric vehicles, helping our environment. mr. speaker, i am honored to cast my vote for the inflation reduction act today. mr. speaker, as chairwoman of the committee on oversight and reform, i rise in support of the inflation reduction act. my committee conducted a three-year investigation of prescription drug pricing. our findings overwhelmingly support the need for this bill's reforms to curb the drug industry's outrageous pricing practices and make prescription drugs more affordable for patients and taxpayers. these reforms include empowering medicare to negotiate prices for certain drugs, a step that is long overdue. my committee's investigation into the fossil fuel industry showed that big oil is refusing to take

feenstra. mr. speaker, i thank ranking member smith for yielding. mr. speaker, i would just quickly note that i am highly offended by the use of the foul language by my democrat colleague. that is completely unacceptable. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong opposition to the democrats' inflation expansion act. this wasteful bill is full of liberal priorities that will continue to fuel inflation, raise taxes on hardworking families, and create an army of 87,000 irs agents that will go after our families and small businesses. democrats claim that only large corporations will be the target of these irs agents. that is factually false. families and small businesses, who do not have the time or the resources, will undergo these invasive audits and will bear the brunt of these irs agents. this radical bill will also supercharge the democrats' green new deal agenda without making our country energy independent again. in fact, they would rather import dirty foreign oil from venezuela than unleash america's energy independence. sadly, that is the state of today's democratic party and their failed liberal agenda. mr. speaker, as a strong fiscal conservative, i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from virginia (mr. scott), the distinguished chairman of the committee on education and labor, and a member of the budget committee. mr. scott of virginia. mr. speaker, with the passage of this bill, medicare will finally be able to negotiate for lower drug prices. the bill extends the american rescue plan's reduction in the cost of insurance under the affordable care act, which has helped us reach the lowest number of uninsured people ever. the bill will make the largest ever investment to address climate change. i am especially pleased with the bill's provisions to turbocharge the development of offshore wind. as chairman of the committee on education and labor, i am encouraged by the permanent extension of the black lung excise tax. the extension will fund future benefits in healthcare for miners in southwest virginia and across coal country who are suffering from black lung disease. extending the tax will protect the long-term sustainability of the black lung disability trust fund by ensuring that the coal industry does not shift the cost of benefits from coal companies to miners, families, or the taxpayer. all of this while simultaneously reducing the federal deficit. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support the legislation. {time} 1215 mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from colorado. mrs. boebert. mr. speaker, insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result. that makes the supporters of this legislation, by definition, insane. reckless spending in this town is what causes inflation. we cannot continue to increase taxes on the american people and put a target on american energy production while spending a historic $370 billion on green new deal initiatives and expect to lower inflation and improve our economy. remember that so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill? we spent $200 billion on green new deal initiatives. i guess that was just a downpayment on this never-ending theft of american tax dollars. you are sacrificing american families at the altar of climate change. mr. speaker, is not it so? joe biden himself said the inflation rate is at zero percent. what the heck are we doing here? why are we passing this so-called inflation reduction act if it is at zero percent? in fact, it is the inflation enhancement act, and it does the exact opposite of what americans need right now. this is just another con game by the democrats calling something one thing and saying another. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from colorado. mrs. boebert. mr. speaker, this bill hires 87,000 new irs agents, and they are armed. the job description tells them that they need to be required to carry a firearm and expect to use deadly force if necessary. excessive taxation is theft. the chairman said that we are using the power of the federal government in this bill. you are darn right you are. you are using the power of the federal government for armed robbery on the taxpayers. i can see why this was rushed through committee and put on the floor. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentlewoman has again expired. the gentlewoman is no longer recognized. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i will say in response to the gentlewoman from colorado (mrs. boebert) that this is typical of what the republicans are doing. first of all, they are making up numbers. there is nowhere anywhere that shows that 87,000 new irs agents are going to be hired in this bill. that is a totally fabricated number. the idea that they are armed--i know that mrs. boebert would like everybody to be armed, as they are in her restaurant, but that is not what irs agents do. mr. speaker, i would implore my republican colleagues to cut out the scare tactics, quit making things up, and debate the substance of this bill. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. peters), a distinguished member of the budget committee. mr. peters. mr. speaker, today, we write a bold new chapter in our history by passing the inflation reduction act, which will substantially lower the cost of living for san diegans and all americans. we are turning our climate ambition into climate action by establishing a methane fee to reduce harmful emissions, creating a clean energy technology bank, and funding wildfire resiliency efforts and clean energy infrastructure. together, these investments will cut our greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and create 1.5 million good-paying jobs. this legislation is also the largest downpayment in deficit reduction since i have served in congress. importantly, the drug pricing reform framework i helped author will help seniors at the drug counter and protect private-sector innovation, and it has earned enough votes to pass the senate. [[page h7649]] the inflation reduction act is a historic measure. after months of negotiations and hard work, let us finally get this done. vote ``yes.'' mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i include in the record notice from the congressional budget office that we received just this morning, as a matter of fact. yes, the bill in front of us and the numbers it claims does include additional audits on individuals making less than $400,000 a year. cbo has received a number of questions regarding our estimate of an amendment offered by senator crapo during the floor debate on h.r. 5376 last weekend. that amendment, #5404, would limit the use of additional funds for the internal revenue service. if the amendment had been adopted none of the additional funds could have been used to audit taxpayers with taxable incomes below $400,000. cbo did not complete a formal cost estimate in advance of consideration of the amendment but the agency did provide the following information to the senate budget committee: cbo estimates that the amendment 5404 would have the following effects: no effect on outlays in the one or ten year budget windows; would reduce outlays in the five year budget window. no effect on revenues in the one year budget window; would reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the provisions of section 10301 in the five and ten year budget windows. no effect on outlays after 2031 but would decrease the ``non-scorable'' revenue resulting from the provisions of section 10301 after 2031. cbo has not completed a point estimate of this amendment but the preliminary assessment indicates that amendment 5404 would reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the provisions of section 10301 by at least $20 billion over the fy2022-fy2031 period. thanks, leigh angres, director of legislative affairs congressional budget office. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. mcclintock). mr. mcclintock. mr. speaker, the democrats printed and spent trillions of dollars we did not have, and they unleashed the worst inflation in 40 years. they waged war on capitalism and the energy industry and produced an economic recession. now, they are doubling down on these foolish policies. the more that some people invest in their mistakes, the less willing they are to admit them. they are adding 87,000 new irs agents--that is larger than the entire population of flint, michigan--in order to collect $200 billion in new taxes, mostly from middle-class families and shopkeepers who do not have the resources to contest expensive audits. they are adding $300 billion in new corporate taxes, which will be passed on to families as higher prices, lower wages, and lower returns. all of this is to give away three-quarters of a trillion dollars more of your earnings to their green energy cronies and other political supporters. that averages about $6,000 per household. just as you cannot drink yourself sober, you cannot spend your way out of inflation, or tax yourself out of recession, or borrow your way out of debt. yet, that is exactly what the democrats claim they can do. what makes them think socialism will work any better here than everywhere else in the world that it has been tried? this bill takes our country further into this dismal future, and only more suffering and poverty will come of it. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from michigan (mr. kildee), a distinguished member of the budget committee. mr. kildee. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the inflation reduction act to help fight inflation and lower costs for the michigan families and seniors that i represent. with this bill, we will be able to lower healthcare costs for michigan families and seniors. this bill will allow medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs, including capping the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month. with this bill, we will create good-paying jobs to combat the climate crisis. this bill will invest in domestic clean energy production and manufacturing facilities to lower costs. it will support making solar panels at companies like hemlock semiconductor and electric vehicles in michigan, not in china. with this bill, which is fully paid for, we will ensure the biggest corporations and the wealthiest individuals pay their fair share of taxes. right now, 55 of the nation's biggest corporations pay zero in federal taxes while making billions in profits. a flint nurse, a saginaw farmer, or a bay city teacher should not pay more in taxes than the largest, wealthiest, most profitable corporations. mr. speaker, i support this legislation. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i include in the record a letter from the nonpartisan congressional budget office, which confirmed that this bill will raise the cost of new prescription drugs for all americans. u.s. congress, congressional budget office, washington, dc, august 4, 2022. re additional information about prescription drug legislation. hon. jason smith, ranking member, committee on the budget, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear congressman: this letter provides additional information that you and your colleagues requested about subtitle i of the reconciliation recommendations of the senate committee on finance regarding prescription drug legislation. you asked about how provisions involving inflation rebates and the negotiation of drug prices would affect launch prices for new drugs and the introduction of new generic drugs. you also asked how a provision to stabilize premiums as a part of the redesign of medicare's benefits would affect the federal budget and premiums. effect of the inflation-rebate and negotiation provisions on launch prices the congressional budget office projects that the inflation-rebate and negotiation provisions would increase the launch prices for drugs that are not yet on the market relative to what such prices would be otherwise. that effect would primarily be driven by the inflation-rebate provisions (sections 129101 and 129102), which would begin to apply to prices within 12 months of a given drug's entering the market. under those provisions, manufacturers would have an incentive to launch new drugs at a higher price to offset slower growth in prices over time. the negotiation provision (section 129001) would have less of an impact on launch prices, cbo expects: although the ceiling for a drug's negotiated price is based on its price from a prior year, negotiation could not occur until drugs were on the market for a number of years--at least 7 for small-molecule drugs and 11 for biologics. higher launch prices would primarily affect spending for drugs in the medicaid program, cbo projects, because an increase in that program's basic rebate brought about by the higher launch prices would only partly offset those prices. higher launch prices would also tend to affect spending for drugs covered by part b of the medicare program because that program's payments for those drugs are based on the average sales prices. over time, slower price growth would attenuate the effect of higher launch prices. in the commercial and medicare part d segments of the market, spending would be less affected by higher launch prices, cbo estimates, because manufacturers would have more flexibility to manage rebates to maximize their revenues in those sectors. effect of the negotiation provision on the introduction of new generic drugs cbo has not analyzed the effects of the negotiation provision on the introduction of new generic drugs. in projecting the effects of the negotiation provision, cbo estimated the share of spending that would be subject to negotiation each year and the average reduction in prices that would stem from the negotiations. but the agency did not analyze how the provision would affect prices or spending on specific drugs, nor did it quantify any impact on the introduction of new generic drugs. effects of the premium-stabilization provision under the premium-stabilization provision (section 129201), the federal government would subsidize any growth in beneficiaries' base premiums for medicare part d exceeding 6 percent from one year to the next over the 2024-2029 period. the provision subsequently would lower the base premium percentage (the percentage of the average cost of standard part d coverage that is used to calculate beneficiaries' premiums) to ensure that premiums did not grow by more than 6 percent between 2029 and 2030. that subsidy and subsequent reduction in premiums would increase federal spending by roughly $40 billion over the 2024-2031 period, cbo estimates. beneficiaries' spending on premiums would be lower under the premium-stabilization provision than it would be without it. that estimate is an average effect among the possible paths of premiums that cbo considered when modeling the uncertainty of future outcomes. under some of those paths, premiums would grow by less than 6 percent a year, and the provision would have no cost; under others, premiums would grow faster, and the provision would generate costs. [[page h7650]] i hope this information is useful to you and your colleagues. please contact me if you have further questions. sincerely, phillip l. swagel, director. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from virginia (mr. good). mr. good of virginia. mr. speaker, the democrats are determined to make inflation worse by continuing their disastrous policies that caused it in the first place. do they not understand the concept of pouring gas on a fire? beyond the reckless spending of nearly another trillion dollars on top of the $30 trillion national debt--there is no climate crisis. it is a hoax. this is the one crisis that even democrats could not create. they have been crying about the climate sky falling for 40 years now, predicting the world would end in 12 years. it is a lie. we are the cleanest large energy producer in the world, and fossil fuels are a wonderful thing. they are essential to our economic and national security. worse yet, democrats want to spend $80 billion to hire 87,000 more armed irs agents to terrorize americans with 1.2 million more audits of hardworking taxpayers. no one in my district has ever told me that the one thing we need is more irs agents. mr. speaker, the american people will vote against this bill on november 8. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, we just heard the big lie a couple more times about 87,000 irs agents that are going to be armed. it is total bunk. nonsense. the republicans should stop it and tell the truth. they are continuing to say it. i will say one thing. we were informed last week by the commissioner of the irs, mr. rettig, an appointee of former president trump, that audits would not increase for anybody making under $400,000 a year. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from washington (ms. jayapal), a distinguished member of the budget committee. ms. jayapal. mr. speaker, today, democrats will take unprecedented and urgent action when we pass the inflation reduction act. today, we make good on our promise to take on climate change and climate justice with historic investments in green technologies that will cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030, create over 9 million good jobs, put $60 billion into environmental justice, and cut energy costs for the average american family by almost $1,000 a year. also, for the first time, we take on big pharma's price gouging, finally allowing medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, capping the cost of insulin, and continuing to make healthcare more affordable. all of it is paid for with taxes on the largest corporations and the wealthiest. we have more to do to complete the rest of the president's agenda on childcare, senior care, expanding medicare, and investing in housing. with a few more democrats in the senate, we will get that done, too. today, let us celebrate this massive investment for the people. people over politics. let us pass this bill. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i appreciate the gentlewoman from washington state, and i would just like to point out that by doubling the size of the irs and adding 87,000 new irs agents, that will result in more than 20,000 of her families in washington state who make less than $20,000 a year that will be receiving audits. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. grothman). mr. grothman. mr. speaker, the 87,000 figure is entirely reasonable, given we have an $80 billion increase. now, is it exact? it might be 86,500. i do not know. it is a big number. first of all, it is that many more people monitoring americans. anybody that wants a free society should be afraid of that. secondly, with 86,500 people poking around small business, it means that much more accountant time that has to be paid for by the small businesses. it means that many more lawyers hired by the small businesses. it is really an accountant and legal make-work program. auditing on this scale will really change the amount of time you have to deal with this. other things, you are getting rid of--i am very disappointed--the good provision you had with regard to carried interest. you are finally going after some of the billionaires of this country, and i wish you would not have caved into the senate and removed that provision. that was a very good thing. next, you have way too much corporate welfare in here. $134 billion in tax credits for so-called favored green industries. what is it? it is that many more businesses depending upon government, and their way to make money is not by providing something the american citizen wants. they are making money because of tax credits they have been given by congress. otherwise, the bill is full of other big spending, as well. there is a 22 percent increase in bureau of indian affairs, 22 percent at a time when we are choking on inflation because of excessive government spending. that is one more spending program to put in here. the speaker pro tempore. members are reminded to direct their comments to the chair. {time} 1230 mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california (ms. lee), who is a distinguished member of the budget committee. ms. lee of california. mr. speaker, i rise today to support the inflation reduction act of 2022. i thank the chairman for yielding his time and also for his leadership. this historic bill puts people over politics by lowering the cost of living for necessities like healthcare, creating good-paying jobs, and ensuring that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share of taxes. now, we know that lower-income communities and communities of color face the brunt of pollution and climate change. this bill makes the single largest investment in combating climate change and works to reduce carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030. we still have a lot ahead, though, and much more work to do, like fighting for investments that have deep impacts on communities of color, such as housing, the child tax credit, investments in our care economy, universal childcare, and insulin caps beyond medicare which disproportionately impacts people of color. but make no mistake, this bill will make an impact on families and our planet. it is a shame and disgrace that republicans will not vote for this bill. but this bill helps republican constituents also. so i am so proud today to vote for this bill for our republican constituents. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i include in the record notice from over 230 economists that this bill before us today would only increase inflation. [from fox business, aug. 4, 2022] over 230 economists warn manchin's spending bill will perpetuate inflation (by kelly laco) a letter sent to house and senate leadership from 230 economists argues that the inflation reduction act is expected to contribute to skyrocketing inflation and will burden the u.s. economy, contrary to president biden and democrats' claims. the economists wrote in the letter first obtained by fox news digital that the u.s. economy is at a ``dangerous crossroads'' and the ``inaptly named `inflation reduction act of 2022' would do nothing of the sort and instead would perpetuate the same fiscal policy errors that have helped precipitate the current troubling economic climate.'' sen. joe manchin, d-w.va, announced last week he reached an agreement with senate majority leader chuck schumer, d-ny, on the $739 billion reconciliation package after more than a year of negotiations among democrats. the economic experts point to the $433 billion in proposed government spending, which they argue ``would create immediate inflationary pressures by boosting demand, while the supply-side tax hikes would constrain supply by discouraging investment and draining the private sector of much-needed resources.'' sen. joe manchin, d-w.va., announced last week that he reached an agreement with senate majority leader chuck schumer, d-ny, on the $739 billion reconciliation package after more that a year of negotiations among democrats. (f. carter smith/bloomberg via/getty images) they also write that of ``particular concern'' is the corporate minimum tax that they say will undercut efforts to restore functioning supply chains. in addition, the bill's prescription drug provisions ``would impose price controls that [[page h7651]] threaten healthcare innovation, creating a human health toll that would add to the financial woes that americans are already experiencing.'' a few of the notable signers include nobel laureate vernon smith, former chair of the council of economic advisers kevin hassett, former director of the office of management and budget jim miller and robert heller, former president of the federal reserve board 1986-1989. in addition, professors from the university of chicago, princeton university, duke university, the university of virginia, columbia university and the university of notre dame, among others, were listed on the letter dated aug. 3. the experts conclude that although they agree with an ``urgent'' need to address inflation, manchin's bill is a ``misleading label'' applied to legislation that would achieve the ``opposite effect'' president biden urged congress to pass the bill during a virtual roundtable thursday. ``my message to congress is this: listen to the american people,'' he said. (jonathan ernst/file photo/ reuters) the letter was sent to schumer, senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., and house minority leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif. schumer has touted the inflation reduction act as an immediate solution to inflation, which reached a new 40-year high last month. ``the inflation reduction act will lower inflation, lower the costs of prescription drugs, close loopholes long exploited by big business who pay no or little taxes,'' schumer said thursday on the senate floor. in addition, biden urged congress to pass the bill during a virtual roundtable thursday. ``my message to congress is this: listen to the american people,'' he said. ``this is the strongest bill you can pass to lower inflation, continue to cut the deficit, reduce health care costs, tackle a climate crisis and promote america's energy security and reduce the burdens facing working-class and middle-class families,'' biden continued. however, republicans are less enthusiastic about the more than $700 billion spending and tax package. senate minority leader mitch mcconnell told fox news that the bill raises taxes and ``calling it an inflation reduction bill is rather laughable.'' (j. scott applewhite) (ap images) mccarthy told fox news on wednesday that ``democrats have no plans to solve all the problems they created'' and manchin's bill is not the solution. in the senate, mcconnell stated this week that most of his colleagues were ``somewhat shocked'' about manchin's reversal of previous positions he continued, telling fox news that the bill raises taxes and ``calling it an inflation reduction bill is rather laughable.'' ``democrats are catastrophically out of touch with what american families actually care about. their approval ratings show it. and their reckless taxing and spending spree proves it, as well,'' said mcconnell in a statement this week. the senate is set to convene on saturday to vote on a procedural motion to move the bill forward. it is still unclear if sen. kyrsten sinema, d-ariz., will support the legislation, and her vote is necessary for final passage of the bill under reconciliation rules that would allow a majority to pass. democrats previously touted a letter from 126 economists supporting manchin's bill. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from florida (mr. donalds). mr. donalds. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to this terrible bill because this terrible bill will increase the cost of energy on every hardworking american in the united states. this bill actually calls for a doubling of the excise tax on oil and on gas, doubling of the royalties on oil and on gas. i was in my district yesterday with americans for prosperity at the true cost of washington event where they actually brought down the price of gasoline to $2.38, the price it was before joe biden took office. i had families in my district crying because they could finally put gas in their cars and food on their dinner table in that day. the democrats come here today, and they want to lecture us about putting people over politics? that is a joke, and it is a lie. these tax increases on oil and gas will only hurt poor families all across america. i do not care if you are in seattle, washington; i do not care if you are in miami, florida; you could be in chicago, illinois; new york city; or san francisco, california; those tax increases hurt the very poor among us, and the democrats are cool with it. mr. speaker, vote ``no'' on this bill. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee), who is a distinguished member of the budget committee. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i want to dispel the myths of the smoke and mirrors that are flaming up across the way with my friends. do they not recognize the opportunity that we have for reducing the costs of healthcare with subsidies so that working families can get the affordable care act? or excitingly, i am so delighted that there is a cap on insulin. diabetes is raging for those on medicare, and we are going to get those on private insurance as well. let us tell the truth about taxes. no taxes on those making $400,000 or less but getting the $160 billion in the top 1 percent that have refused to pay their fair share. what is this folder? these are letters from my county attorneys and communities about concrete batch facilities put in neighborhoods of hispanics and african americans by trinity gardens in the east end and aldine. this legislation, $60 billion, will help save these people who have been living in their homes and losing their homes because environmental toxins like a concrete batch facility gets put in their neighborhood and creates respiratory diseases: asthma, bad grass, and parks that you cannot play in. mr. speaker, i support this legislation. why? because it is for the working people in america. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise to wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support the inflation reduction act of 2022, h.r. 5376. i commend our democratic colleagues in the senate--whose tireless efforts culminated in this landmark legislation--and our democratic caucus in the house, whose commitment to the policies embodied in this legislation kept the prospect for progress alive and ready for action over the past year. we persevered to extend health care benefits, limit the cost of medication, combat the climate crisis, help impoverished americans, and reduce inflation for all americans. we never relinquished our focus and determination to help those who are suffering from the economic aftershocks of covid-19. enactment of the inflation reduction act is crucial at this vital moment, as americans need the economic relief that this bill will provide. it will boost quality-of-life for american families by reducing costs and inflation, and bolstering our national economy and competitiveness for years to come. this legislation is truly historic because it will dramatically advance major policies and programs supported by the vast majority of americans, and it will do so in a fiscally responsible way, applying much of the revenue raised to deficit reduction. a key message that this legislation sends is that congress, with democrats at the helm, is focused on providing aid to working americans, middle-income families, impoverished americans, and those who most need a little help during challenging times. this is a stark contrast from a few years ago, when republicans in control of congress passed bills that gave massive tax breaks to the wealthiest people and corporations, and helped the rich get richer, while tossing mere table scraps to the middle class, and barely a few crumbs to americans suffering in poverty. so, i am delighted that the inflation reduction act will provide urgently needed financial relief to americans in need, reforms to address the climate crisis, and initiatives that will help our nation transition to its next era of success for all americans. among the provisions that will directly benefit family finances across the country are the inflation reduction act's health care reforms, initiatives, assistance, and restraints on cost increases. for the first time after years of efforts by democrats, medicare will be able to negotiate with drug companies to lower the price of medications for americans receiving medicare. maximum prices for 10 drugs will take effect in 2026, 15 more drugs in 2027, another 15 in 2028, and 20 more in 2029 and beyond. manufacturers that do not offer a price equal to or less than the maximum fair price will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of 10 times the difference between the offered price and the maximum fair price for all of its drugs sold in violation of that. the ira will impose rebates on drug companies that increase prices faster than inflation to limit annual increases in drug prices for people with medicare. the inflation rebate provision will be implemented beginning in 2023, using 2021 as the base year for determining price changes relative to inflation. another major reform is a new $2,000 annual cap on medicare part d out-of-pocket spending starting in 2025. currently, there is no limit on out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs that seniors need. this bill ensures that devastating diagnoses, like cancer, will never again mean paying tens of thousands out-of-pocket for just one drug, which forces medicare recipients into severe financial hardship. [[page h7652]] the bill expands the low-income subsidy program in medicare part d. currently, it is fully available to those earning less than 135 percent of the federal poverty level, and partially available to those earning less than 150 percent of that level. the bill eliminates the partial subsidy, giving those earning up to 150% of the poverty level the full low-income subsidy in medicare part d. the bill initiates a major reform to help medicare patients who need insulin and have been forced to pay exorbitant costs for their life- sustaining supply. the inflation reduction act caps out-of-pocket costs at $35 per month for insulin co-pays under medicare programs. cost-sharing for part d plans will be capped at $35 for approved insulin products starting in 2023. after 2025, the price will be the lesser of $35, 25 percent of the maximum fair price, or 25 percent of the negotiated price. from january to march 2023, there will be temporary subsidies for any cost sharing over $35 per month. while i am delighted that h.r. 5376 imposes a $35 per month cap on the price of insulin for people covered by medicare, this cap should have extended to americans with private insurance. i was very upset that senate republicans rejected that policy, as it is immoral to side with drug companies that force people to choose between life-sustaining insulin and other daily needs. some americans have died because they could not afford their insulin, which is subject to unjustifiable pricing practices. this bill should have ensured that americans with private health insurance would benefit from a $35 per month cap on their insulin costs, and i will continue the fight for this reform. the inflation reduction act lowers health insurance premiums for nearly 13 million low- and middle-income americans whose coverage is from the affordable care act. the bill allocates $64 billion to extend tax credits for three years, through 2025. recipients saved on average $800 in 2021. monthly premiums were estimated to decrease by $50 per person on average in 2022, and 80 percent of aca enrollees with the tax credits were able to find a plan that amounted to $10 or less per month. this is extremely important because extension of these credits subsidizing the cost of health insurance will prevent 3 million people from becoming uninsured due to steep premium hikes, protecting them from financial hardship, and saving the health care system from the perilous costs of uncompensated care. i was dismayed that senator warnock's amendment extending medicaid expansion to 2.2 million people living in poverty in 12 states was not adopted by the senate. impoverished americans with no access to affordable health care would have been able to see a doctor when they are sick, pregnant, or have other health needs. we must still close the medicaid coverage gap for americans who have a need for, and the right to, health care. although it is not in this bill, i will continue to fight for this. the bill makes historic investments to combat climate change by putting the united states on a path to reduce emissions by 40% by 2030, investing $369 billion in clean energy and energy efficiency to lower household energy costs, and ensuring that lower-income households can benefit from these programs. the bill's clean energy and emission reduction programs attack the climate crisis at its source--electric utilities, cars, trucks, and methane emission producers--while ensuring that rural and disadvantaged communities share the benefits. the ira provides direct consumer incentives to relieve the high costs of energy and decrease utility bills by encouraging purchases of energy efficient and clean-energy goods, with a significant portion of the funding going to lower-income households and disadvantaged communities. the bill includes $9 billion in consumer home energy rebate programs, focused on low-income consumers, to electrify home appliances and for energy efficient retrofits. the ira provides 10 years of consumer tax credits to make homes energy efficient, using clean energy and making heat pumps, rooftop solar, community solar projects, electric hvac, and efficient water heaters more affordable. the bill includes a $4,000 consumer tax credit for lower- and middle- income individuals to buy used clean-energy vehicles, and up to a $7,500 tax credit to buy new clean-energy vehicles. this will bring electric cars--and the fuel costs they save--within the reach of working families. additionally, the bill establishes a $1 billion grant program to make affordable housing more energy efficient. the investments in this bill will reduce emissions in every sector of the economy, substantially reducing emissions from electricity generation, transportation, industrial manufacturing, buildings, and agriculture. tax credits are provided for clean sources of electricity and energy storage, and roughly $30 billion in targeted grant and loan programs for states and electric utilities to accelerate the transition to clean electricity. the legislation includes tax credits and grants for clean fuels and clean commercial vehicles to reduce emissions from all parts of the transportation sector. the bill provides grants and tax credits to reduce emissions from industrial manufacturing processes, including almost $6 billion for a new advanced industrial facilities deployment program to reduce emissions from the largest industrial emitters like chemical, steel and cement plants. to spur innovation, $27 billion is provided for a clean energy technology accelerator to aid deployment of technologies that reduce emissions, especially in disadvantaged communities. the ira has $9 billion for federal procurement of american-made clean products, including $3 billion for zero-emission postal service vehicles, to create a stable market for them. the inflation reduction act includes over $60 billion for environmental justice priorities to drive investments into disadvantaged communities. the bill has $3 billion for environmental and climate justice block grants that will invest in community-led projects in disadvantaged communities and community capacity building centers to address disproportionate environmental and public health harms related to pollution and climate change. the ira creates neighborhood access and equity grants with $3 billion to aid neighborhood equity, safety, and affordable transportation access. this landmark program addresses a long legacy of ignoring environmental justice concerns in project decision-making. the grants aim to reconnect communities divided by infrastructure barriers, mitigate negative impacts of transit facilities or construction projects on disadvantaged or underserved communities, and support equitable transportation planning and community engagement activities. the bill provides another $3 billion for grants to reduce air pollution at ports to support the purchase and installation of zero- emission equipment and technology at ports. the ira also provides $1 billion for clean heavy-duty vehicles, such as school and transit buses and garbage trucks. there is $60 million for diesel emissions reduction act grants to address diesel emissions from goods movement facilities like airports and railyards, and from vehicles using those facilities. the ira has $236 million for air pollution monitoring that will particularly benefit disadvantaged communities exposed to areas with persistent air pollution. the bill includes $50 million to address air pollution at schools by monitoring and reducing air pollution at public schools in low-income and disadvantaged communities. the bill provides $87 million for the low emissions electricity program to support low-income and disadvantaged communities, and offer technical assistance to industry, as well as state and local governments, as they work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. environmental justice is also central to initiatives that aim to decarbonize the economy, such as the technology accelerator and consumer home energy rebate programs, that focus on disadvantaged and low-income communities. additionally, many of the clean energy tax credits include either a bonus or set-aside structure to drive investments and economic development in disadvantaged communities. this bill funds energy reliability, cleaner energy, and historic investments in american clean energy manufacturing. it includes over $60 billion for clean energy manufacturing in the u.s. across the full supply chain of clean energy and transportation technologies. these manufacturing incentives will help alleviate inflation and reduce the risk of future price shocks by bringing down the cost of clean energy and clean vehicles and relieving supply chain bottlenecks. the ira invests roughly $30 billion for production tax credits to accelerate u.s. manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals processing. the bill has a $10 billion investment tax credit to build clean technology [[page h7653]] manufacturing facilities, like facilities that make electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels. the bill also funds $500 million in the defense production act for heat pumps and critical minerals processing. the bill has $2 billion in grants to retool auto manufacturing facilities to manufacture clean vehicles, ensuring that auto manufacturing jobs stay in the communities that rely on them. the ira provides up to $20 billion in loans to build new clean vehicle manufacturing facilities across the country. to spur the next generation of energy technologies, the bill provides $2 billion for national labs to accelerate breakthrough energy research. to afford these investments and reduce the deficit, the inflation reduction act requires the wealthiest people and corporations to pay their fair share of taxes, without raising taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 each year. in fact, the non-partisan joint committee on taxation reported that, in addition to not increasing taxes on any family making $400,000 or less, taxes on those families would actually be reduced by the ira. this would correct the longstanding injustice of hardworking american families paying their taxes on time while wealthy millionaires and billionaires avoid paying the taxes they owe to the federal government. by creating a more equitable tax system, this bill will ease the pressure of inflation and allow more americans to participate productively in the economy. americans overwhelmingly agree that corporations have paid too little for too long. only in washington would republicans fight against cutting costs for low- and middle- income workers and their families in defense of wealthy corporations. to fairly and appropriately raise revenues, the bill includes major reforms, each of which are sound tax policies. the inflation reduction act imposes a corporate alternative minimum tax on corporations that earn more than $1 billion in annual profit, but do not pay at least a 15 percent tax rate. this would apply to about 150 corporations that average nearly $9 billion in profit, but which paid effective tax rates of just 1.1 percent. the minimum tax will make sure they pay their fair share, and will raise approximately $222 billion. the bill will levy a 1 percent fee on stock buybacks by publicly- traded corporations to level the playing field. this reform to the tax code, which raises $74 billion, would put an end to favoring buybacks for rich shareholders and executives over investments in workers and innovation. the legislation will help prevent the wealthiest americans from sheltering their nonbusiness income and avoiding taxes. by extending the limitation on excess business losses for two years, the bill would raise an additional $52 billion. this bill also gives the irs resources to rebuild its antiquated systems to make the wealthy pay their taxes. by investing $80 billion over ten years for tax enforcement and compliance, the congressional budget office estimates the irs will collect $203 billion. nearly 75 percent of americans believe the irs should conduct more tax audits of large corporations and millionaires. recently, the irs commissioner emphasized that families making under $400,000 per year will not see increased audits. i was upset that the senate did not close the carried interest loophole, which lets investment fund managers pay lower taxes on their earnings than wage earners pay. billionaires scored a win worth billions as others struggle to make ends meet. yet, i am pleased that the bill levels the playing field with other taxes. the inflation reduction act is excellent legislation that will be a great leap forward for the american people, including for my constituents in the 18th congressional district of texas. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i want to point out that by doubling the size of the irs, working people in america, 85,000 more families in the state of texas, will face additional audits--these are families who make less than $200,000--because of doubling of the irs. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. burgess). mr. burgess. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from missouri for yielding. mr. speaker, we are hearing that this bill is a tax cut. but that only applies if you sign up for obamacare and participate in all the green tax credits. but if you do not, then this bill is a tax increase of over $10.5 billion for those making under $200,000 a year. despite what you say, there is $80 billion in this bill for 87,000 new irs agents, and this will disproportionately increase audits on low- and middle-income earners at a time when even the best cpa firms cannot find qualified employees. now, wednesday in the rules committee, i tried to get an amendment by mr. davidson of ohio made in order that would require that all of these new hires at least be cpas. this was rejected by every democrat in the rules committee. mr. speaker, they are coming after you. they are coming after you with poorly trained technicians, and it is just not right. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. wasserman schultz), who is a distinguished member of the appropriations committee. ms. wasserman schultz. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, i proudly rise to support legislation that delivers relief to every kitchen table across the country, cuts healthcare and drug costs, and creates millions of good-paying jobs to save our planet for future generations. in my home state of florida, the inflation reduction act hands security and peace of mind to millions of seniors in my state. it caps out-of-pocket prescription costs and monthly insulin costs for medicare recipients, and finally allows medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. millions of floridians will be healthier and more financially secure by lowering premiums for 13 million americans with expanded financial help for the affordable care act healthcare policies. it will slash energy costs and work to stop our warming planet from stealing their grandchildren's future. this is our biggest shot ever to tackle climate change by speeding up clean energy transitions and cutting climate pollution 40 percent by 2030. the inflation reduction act does all this by making corporations pay their fair share, reducing the deficit, and ensuring no one who makes less than $400,000 will pay one penny more. this is game-changing relief for our seniors, our climate, and anyone demanding tax fairness. mr. speaker, i urge all of my colleagues to pass this lifesaving legislation. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. smucker), who is a great leader on the budget committee. mr. smucker. mr. speaker, what a time to raise taxes and to spend nearly $1 trillion more. the economy is in a recession, food inflation is up 12.9 percent over the past year, gas is up 49 percent, and shelter costs rose by 5.7 percent. what will families get instead of relief? they will get $10.6 billion in tax increases, and 50 percent more may get audited by the irs. now, the chairman on the other side has disputed these 87,000 new agents. i would ask him to read page 37 of the bill which provides for $45 billion in new funding to the irs, specifically for enforcement activities, and ask if he will dispute that as well. where does he think $45 billion is going to go? in fact, we all know the irs needs a lot of help to provide constituent services. fourteen times more dollars are going for enforcement than to helping them do their job. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman from pennsylvania an additional 15 seconds. mr. smucker. our democrat colleagues are also falsely insisting this bill will not raise taxes on small businesses or households with incomes below $400,000. yet, during rules committee debate on the bill, a ways and means democrat admitted that households making less than $400,000 per year will see a tax increase in this bill. he was citing the nonpartisan analysis from jct. [[page h7654]] do not be fooled. this bill is not a plan to address inflation. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i just want to clarify one thing. it seems to me that republicans just do not want people to pay taxes even if they are owed. we know there are hundreds of billions of dollars of owed-but-not-paid taxes in this country every year. this is an attempt to try and recover some of that money that is owed and is not being paid by taxpayers who are, in many cases, cheating. to be clear, irs has made no decisions or no announcements regarding the potential hiring plans under this bill. as i said before, the commissioner of the irs has said that they are not going to increase audits of people making under $400,000. a lot of this money is designed to go to help service the legitimate and lawful taxpayers of this country by giving them better service, making the irs more responsive, and to upgrading equipment which is now 50 or 60 years old in many cases. so they can continue with this claim that we are going to go after taxpayers with armed irs agents, and i know that republicans would like to arm every tax agent as they want to arm everybody else in this country, but that is nonsense. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. khanna), who is a distinguished member of the armed services committee. mr. khanna. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman for his leadership in passing the most historic climate legislation in the history of this nation and in the history of the world. it is appropriate that it would be named after chairman yarmuth after his distinguished service in this congress. but i also thank all the young people out there and the environmental activists who for so long had no hope that this body would do anything. they marched, they protested, and they organized. they deserve credit for the $369 billion that will build solar, wind, and that will build electric vehicles. i understand it is only a down payment on what we need for climate. i understand there is more work to be done, so we eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, so we have more of a commitment to environmental justice, and so that we do not have mandates on oil leasing. but i am so proud of the young folks for recognizing that getting something done is better than getting nothing done. this is the first victory in many victories to come, and they deserve credit for our passing this bill today. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i want to point out to the chairman of the budget committee that--maybe his staff has not presented it to him--the congressional budget office this morning--this morning--confirmed that people making less than $400,000 a year will face more audits. you keep saying: let the facts be real, no scare tactics. the facts from the congressional budget office are that, in fact, your legislation is increasing more audits on people who make less than $400,000 a year. i put it in the record. you can read it there. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the great gentleman from georgia (mr. carter). mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i rise today in opposition to the inflation expansion act which is threatening the same industries that it purports to help. washington democrats who claim to champion electric vehicles are pushing a bill--you are pushing this bill that will threaten an over $5 billion investment hyundai is making in the first congressional district of georgia. now, mr. speaker, this is serious. this is a $5 billion investment that they are threatening. this will be the automaker's first dedicated electric vehicle manufacturing plant in the united states and will create over 8,000 jobs upon completion. this bill's new ev tax credit discriminates against and excludes south korea, a key strategic trading partner and longtime ally of the united states and may actually violate the korus free trade agreement. this burdensome regulation could prevent billions of dollars in investment, thousands of jobs, and affordable electric vehicles from coming to market in the united states. the answer is clear: we need innovation not regulation. the private sector is leading the charge. you are messing around with a $5 billion investment and 8,000 jobs, mr. speaker. i hope that you will let my colleagues know, mr. speaker. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. green), who is the distinguished member of the financial services committee. mr. green of texas. mr. speaker, to my friends across the aisle: where were you when your twice impeached president was putting billions of dollars in the pockets of the wealthy? you complain about drug prices being reduced for seniors, complain about them having out-of-pocket costs capped at $2,000? i refuse to allow a bill that is good to be defeated by a perfect bill that we will not get. i will support this bill, and i ask my colleagues to do so as well. it is time to take care of our seniors. the speaker pro tempore. members are again reminded to direct their remarks to the chair. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the great gentleman from mississippi (mr. guest). mr. guest. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong opposition to this destructive piece of legislation. every day i hear from fellow mississippians who struggle to buy gas and groceries because of inflation fueled by the left's reckless spending. now, instead of acknowledging the impact their out-of-control spending has had on americans, my colleagues across the aisle are trying to pass legislation that will increase taxes on americans, spend hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars on far-left priorities, and pass legislation that will add an army of irs agents. it is time to acknowledge that the american people are suffering because of legislation exactly like this. the american people are tired of this economic crisis, and they have been clear: do not raise taxes, do not add to this recession with more wasteful spending, do not weaponize the irs, and do not vote for this legislation. this congress must listen to the american people and vote against this bill. {time} 1245 mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. pocan), a distinguished member of the appropriations committee. mr. pocan. mr. speaker, global inflation caused by our reopening due to covid-19 has caused increased prices in everything from gasoline to groceries to healthcare. today, we put people over politics as we lessen the impact of global inflation on the american people via the inflation reduction act. among the many things it does, it addresses some of the drivers of higher energy costs while also investing in u.s.-based renewable energy that will make us more energy independent and less dirty. it finally allows us to negotiate lower prescription drug prices through volume purchasing via medicare while capping out-of-pocket drug expenses for seniors to no more than $2,000 per year. we make these big investments by ensuring that corporations that have often gamed the system pay a minimal share of taxes and go after wealthy tax cheats who, all too often, have evaded their responsibilities. i will gladly vote for this bill today. it is time to stand up to big pharma and those energy companies making record profits while making our planet less safe, and it is important we make sure that corporations pay their fair share of taxes to reduce the burden on working families. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from florida (mrs. cammack), my good friend. mrs. cammack. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong opposition to the inflation expansion act. it feels a little bit like groundhog day here on capitol hill because it was not but about a year ago that we found ourselves debating almost this very same legislation. it was a bad idea then; it is a bad idea now. even bernie sanders is not buying this bill and has said that it will not do much to reduce inflation. the only difference here really is the price tag from a year ago-- $745 billion in new spending. that is not cheap. do you know what we could do with that? you could give every single working mom in america a check for $96,000. you could give hardworking american seniors, who are, many of them, [[page h7655]] now retired and having to go back to work, and they are on fixed incomes, you could give them $14,000. you could give every homeless veteran in america a check for $5.6 million with this bill. instead, we are going to double the size of the irs and target hardworking families who make $400,000 or less. we know it to be a fact. stop denying it. the senate democrats refused and rejected the amendment that would have protected families making $400,000 or less. reject this bill. put americans first. it is time to vote hell no. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. allred), a distinguished member of the transportation and infrastructure committee. mr. allred. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of the inflation reduction act. for too long, congress has refused to act while seniors like my mom, who is a breast cancer survivor, endured price gouging on their medicines while on medicare. today, democrats in congress are changing that. we are going to stand up to big pharma and let medicare negotiate lower prices and cap out- of-pocket costs at $2,000, as well as capping the cost of insulin. for too long, congress has refused to address the climate crisis and invest in clean energy. today, democrats in congress are changing that. through the largest-ever investment to fight climate change, this bill will cut emissions by 40 percent by 2030. it unleashes american and, yes, texas-made clean energy while creating 9 million jobs. thanks to president biden, and democrats in congress, this historic legislation will impact our nation for generations to come, all while reducing the deficit without raising taxes on folks making less than $400,000 a year. it is a big deal, and i cannot wait to vote ``yes'' for it. i encourage my colleagues to do the same. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. graves), my good friend. mr. graves of louisiana. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, let us be clear. everybody in this chamber supports lowering prescription drug costs, lowering these outrageous costs that all of our constituents are paying across the country. we all support clean, affordable energy and access to those resources. we all support lowering inflation. the difference is, where the credibility gap exists, is that the very problems, the very crisis that our country is experiencing today, were actually caused by the biden administration's policies. we went from, in my hometown, $1.80 a gallon for gasoline to, recently, i paid $4.20. we have seen a tripling of natural gas costs. their own policies have caused this. nearly a quarter of all americans today cannot even afford to pay their electricity bills. the biden administration policies have caused record inflation, making americans unable to even afford grocery costs. the biden administration policies have resulted in higher emissions, not lower emissions, as compared to the previous administration. biden administration policies resulted in this president going to countries like saudi arabia and asking them for energy while telling americans that we cannot produce. mr. speaker, i cannot help but reminisce over jack abramoff, a disgraced lobbyist, convicted, who created problems and then charged clients to fix them. the difference between this bill and jack abramoff is that jack abramoff actually fixed problems for his clients. this bill is a disaster. there is a credibility gap. they have caused problems, and now we are being asked to trust them to fix them, and we simply cannot. oppose this legislation. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. carter), a distinguished member of the transportation and infrastructure committee. mr. carter of louisiana. mr. speaker, far too many things in life just are not fair. however, one thing should, frankly, always be fair, and that is taxes. what should always be fair is access to insulin, access to clean energy, and relief from the raging energy costs that we see across our country. this historic inflation reduction act is fully paid for by requiring the biggest corporations and the ultrawealthy to pay their fair share. it does so without any new taxes on small businesses or those making under $400,000. i said ``$400,000.'' we can achieve this goal by strengthening irs enforcement against wealthy tax cheats and closing tax loopholes exploited by the wealthiest few, 150 massive corporations. in opposing these provisions, my republican colleagues are, sadly, aligning themselves with megacorporations and the ultrawealthy and turning their backs on the american people. i am proud that, with this bill, democrats are once again putting people over politics, fighting for the american people. i urge full support for this measure. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i include in the record analysis from the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation, which confirms that the bill increases taxes by $10.6 billion on individuals making under $200,000 in 2023 and increases taxes by $32.6 billion across all incomes.

effects of spending under subtitle c estimated by congressional budget office. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the good gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. meuser). mr. meuser. mr. speaker, the american people are sick and tired of runaway government promises of how excessive spending, tax increases, and green new deal special interest investments are somehow going to make their lives better and reduce inflation. yet, we are here today in this chamber to raise taxes on the american people, hire 87,000 new irs auditors forever more, mr. speaker, and pass over a half trillion dollars in new government spending, all in the name of the inflation reduction act. mr. speaker, is this some sort of joke? do we actually think that the american people believe that? well, they do not. by the way, regarding the $400,000 less will not get taxed, if a pass- through business makes $400k and the partners pay themselves $100,000 each, they will fall under the audit initiative by the irs. as well, the projections for irs hiring do not count only taxing those over $400k, so the whole thing was made up to make it sound better than it is. mr. speaker, i urge a ``no'' vote. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from nevada (mr. horsford), a distinguished member of the budget committee. mr. horsford. mr. speaker, i will cast my vote today to lower the cost of prescription drugs, tackle the climate crisis, and make big corporations pay their fair share in taxes while putting people over politics. mr. speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle love to rant about fiscal responsibility, but the facts are clear: every time a republican president and congressional majority collude for their corporate friends and the rich elite, our deficits soar. so, it is up to democrats to clean up that mess. this inflation reduction act is a historic downpayment on deficit reduction of approximately $300 billion to fight inflation. for years, nevadans have seen their cost of living rise, while my republican colleagues across the aisle have focused on giving away tax cuts for the wealthy. well, today, we vote for seniors, in my district and across america, who want one thing from congress right now, and that is to lower prescription drug prices. today, we will cast our votes to pass the inflation reduction act because it includes an important provision to cap out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 per senior and to cap insulin costs at $35 a month for seniors and individuals with disabilities. finally, the inflation reduction act includes a historic step to combat the climate crisis, including $4 billion to states like nevada to combat the effects of the two-decades-long western drought. mr. speaker, i urge this body to pass this legislation for the people, putting people over politics. [[page h7658]] mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i would like to point out to the gentleman from nevada that since joe biden has taken the oath of office, his reckless spending has led to an inflation crisis that has cost his families in nevada $9,700 per family. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the great gentleman from ohio (mr. carey). mr. carey. mr. speaker, americans are in the midst of a recession and the worst inflation in over 40 years, yet my friends across the aisle are set to pass a $745 billion spending bill that will raise taxes, fund the green new deal initiatives, and hire 87,000 irs agents to target americans--all this while doing nothing to reduce inflation and adding over $146 billion in debt. now, they say it will not raise taxes on people making less than $400,000, but the joint committee on taxation has said at least half of all new tax revenue raised will come from those earning under $400,000. probably the biggest thing for me is the 87,000 new irs agents. to folks back in ohio, i just want to put this in a way that you can understand. that is 10,000 more people than live in the city of parma. that is 17,000 more people that live in the city of canton, 23,000 more than in youngstown. this is not the inflation reduction act. this is the audit america act. {time} 1300 mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i want to respond one more time to these claims about 87,000 new irs agents. the irs has never made any announcement about plans to hire any number of agents. the washington post fact-checker has actually given that claim three pinocchios. again, these are republicans making it up to scare the american people. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from virginia (ms. spanberger), a distinguished member of the committee on agriculture. ms. spanberger. mr. speaker, today, i am so proud to rise in support of the inflation reduction act. as chair of the subcommittee on conservation and forestry, i am excited that this bill includes dedicated funding to further the role of virginia's crop and livestock producers in our work to protect our planet. farmers are the original conservationists, and their expertise cannot be ignored if we are going to meet our shared climate goals while also bringing greater investments to rural america, strengthening our farmers' bottom lines, and lowering the cost of inputs. we can make investments in our nation's producers by investing in existing voluntary conservation programs at usda, and that is what this legislation does. i am proud that the conservation provisions in this bill reflect multiple pieces of legislation that i have championed to make possible, including my bipartisan reap improvement act. these provisions include stronger investments in the rural energy for america program, or reap, and support our conservation workforce and our natural resources conservation service. these are smart investments for the bottom lines of our farmers. mr. smith of missouri. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. yarmuth. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new york (mr. jones), a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary. mr. jones. mr. speaker, i am so proud to be standing here today in this chamber as we make history for the american people. democrats fought so hard for so long to get to this moment. even when faced with what many described as insurmountable odds, we kept at it. we never gave up. we never relented in our advocacy. we said we wanted to get back to the negotiating table and that we wanted to start with climate. now, we will make the biggest climate investment this nation has ever seen, while creating millions of good-paying jobs. the stakes of the climate crisis could not be higher, especially for low-income communities and communities of color around the country, who are always the hardest hit. this legislation is also for my grandmother, alice jones, who worked well past the age of retirement just to pay for the high cost of prescription drugs and medical procedures not fully covered by medicare, as we know. today, we will also lower prescription drug prices for our seniors. this is why i ran for congress. this is government working for the people. this is democrats delivering on our promises. mr. smith of missouri. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. obernolte). mr. obernolte. madam speaker, new data from the department of labor released this week indicates that inflation in america remains at a 40- year high. numerous studies, including one by the san francisco branch of our federal reserve bank, indicate that the reason why americans disproportionately are suffering from this inflation is reckless levels of deficit spending by our federal government. only the united states congress could respond to the situation with a bill that increases federal spending by over $700 billion at the same time it increases taxes on americans. to add insult to injury, our own congressional budget office, as well as the university of pennsylvania wharton school of business, and hundreds of economists, tell us that this bill, the so-called inflation reduction act, will not actually reduce inflation at all. we need to get our fiscal house in order and solve the reckless spending that is causing this inflation instead of taking action that makes the situation even worse. i urge a ``no'' vote. mr. yarmuth. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from north carolina (ms. ross), a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary. ms. ross. madam speaker, i rise to support the inflation reduction act. this bill is a monumental achievement that will move america forward, making important advances in everything from healthcare costs to energy prices to tax fairness. coming from north carolina, a state battered with increasing regularity by catastrophic storms, i am especially proud that this act represents the most significant investment to combat climate change in u.s. history. i am also pleased that this bill includes a measure that i have championed, which will end the prior moratorium on offshore wind. the trump administration basically banned north carolina from taking advantage of industrial-scale offshore wind. our utilities support it, it is good for our economy, and it is good for our environment. this is an important, game-changing bill. mr. smith of missouri. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from georgia (mr. clyde), who definitely has experience with the irs. mr. clyde. madam speaker, despite the white house's politically motivated propaganda that claims our economy is in a transition with zero percent inflation, the reality is we are facing an economic recession and continue to battle 40-year high inflation. as millions of americans struggle to buy groceries, fill up their gas tanks, afford rent, and pay utility bills, democrats are ramming through their tax-and-spend bill that will only make life worse. now, i know the left cannot quite grasp the basics of high school biology, but it appears that they also need a lesson on the fundamentals of economics and basic math. but i do not think they are interested in their much-needed schooling because their actions are intentional. time and time again, the left proves their priorities lie with big government socialism, not the american people. through increased irs audits, they are willing to demolish any small business, worker, or family that gets in their way. madam speaker, i urge all my colleagues to reject fueling inflation and reject tax hikes during a recession by voting ``no'' on democrats' build back broke bill. mr. yarmuth. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of missouri. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. roy). mr. roy. madam speaker, my democratic colleagues own this bill. let us be clear: tax increases for the average american, check. $80 billion to the internal revenue service to go after those americans, to hire agents, jobs already posted, check. [[page h7659]] increased electricity prices, increased gas prices, tilted windmills with your unicorn energy policies, check. increased government and corporate control of healthcare, check. i hear my colleagues talking about, ``oh, we are going to go after pharma.'' well, what did the cdc say yesterday? do not worry about all of those mandates, do not worry about all of those vaccines, and do not worry about all the quarantines. sorry, pox on us. but my colleagues now today are going to dump hundreds of billions of dollars into corporate america, screwing over the american people every single day with tax audits, increased energy prices, and increased taxes. congratulations. take that to the polls. mr. yarmuth. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of missouri. madam speaker, may i inquire as to how much time is remaining? the speaker pro tempore (ms. underwood). the gentleman from missouri has 1 minute remaining. mr. smith of missouri. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. the solution to the inflation crisis that the democrats have set forward is to spend hundreds of billions of more dollars and to tax all hardworking americans once again. you cannot spend your way out of inflation, and you cannot tax your way out of recession. but that is the recipe that the one-party, democrat rule in washington, d.c., has suggested for the hardworking americans who are barely surviving to put food on their table, clothes on their backs, and gasoline in their cars. i will point out to the chairman that his president's budget outlined an additional $80 billion for the irs. highlighted in that budget he wanted 87,000 irs agents. that is where the number is coming from, from your president, who provided a budget. i know in the budget committee, we have never had a hearing on budget for the last 3\1/2\ years. that is probably why you did not know 87,000 auditors were in the president's budget. madam speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. yarmuth. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, i want to remind my republican colleagues and the american people, once again, what republicans will be voting against today. they will be voting against cutting prescription drug prices for their constituents. they will be voting against combating inflation and lowering energy costs. they will be voting against the largest federal investment in dealing with climate crisis in the history of this country. i cannot believe that i still heard from the other side today the hoax comment, that climate change is a hoax. you would think that as we watch what is going on in the world, while i watch what is going on in my state, when my citizens in eastern kentucky were devastated by historic floods, when my citizens in western kentucky were devastated by historic tornadoes, all of which scientists have said were exacerbated by climate change, that there are still people who deny that climate change exists. but for the first time in this country, we will show true leadership to the world, that we are taking action, and we are going to lead the world in combating climate change. the gentleman from texas said democrats own this bill. yes, we do. proud of it. i do not know one member of the democratic caucus who is not thrilled to death today that we are doing what we are doing, because the vast majority of the american people support what we are doing. the vast majority of the american people want us to cap out-of- pocket expenses for seniors for their medications at $2,000. republicans say no. they are going to vote against that. they are going to vote against a cap of a $35 copay for insulin. tens of millions of americans will benefit from that. we know that five former secretaries of the treasury from both democratic and republican administrations, 126 of our nation's top economists, including seven nobel laureates, support the inflation reduction act. on other side, we have big pharma, corporate lobbyists, tax cheats, and congressional republicans. this debate has made clearer than ever that democrats are working to make life better for the american people while republicans just do not care. it is as simple as it is harsh. this legislation is important, historic, and a significant win for american families and for the planet. i will be voting ``yes'' on the inflation reduction act, and soon we will be sending it to president biden's desk to be signed into law. i know he will be proud to do that as well. madam speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. neal) and the gentleman from texas (mr. brady) each will control 30 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. as we begin the proceeding here on the ways and means portion of the legislation, i want to begin by calling attention to the untimely and tragic loss of our colleague, jackie walorski, and two members of her staff. jackie was a force on the committee, as well as the ranking member of the subcommittee on worker and family support. she led with deep commitment to children and families and was well regarded as a member of the community, a real humanitarian. you could not miss her bright smile or her booming laugh. she embodied what it meant to serve. when she called me ``mr. chairman,'' as she always did in the hallway, loudly, with a booming voice, i know she meant it. we were all lucky to have had her as a colleague and even luckier to be able to call her a friend. the families and loved ones of congresswoman walorski, emma thomson, and zachery potts remain in our thoughts and prayers. may they rest in peace, as valued members of the ways and means family. madam speaker, i rise in full support of the inflation reduction act. i look forward, as i have in the past, to this moment, reciting the wisdom that is often referenced by me, because the words come from another son of massachusetts, mr. webster. over the speaker's rostrum that adorns this marvelous institution, which i love, the quote is simple: ``let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, and promote all its great interests and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.'' the inflation reduction act is something worthy of being remembered. this is substantive and transformative legislation, a reminder to all that in the legislative life and its rhythms, we generally pursue perfection but accept the possible. part of that is what we are marking at this moment. this is a historic win for family pocketbooks, for americans' health, and for the future of climate security. we fund these gains by ensuring that large, profitable companies pay their fair share, just like all members of the american family are asked to do. {time} 1315 the inflation reduction act will lower costs. for the first time, medicare will negotiate drug prices, and there will be a cap on what comes out of seniors' pockets for their lifesaving prescriptions. no more rationing or forgoing necessary medicines. we are lowering healthcare costs for millions of low-income and middle-income americans by extending the affordable care act's premium tax credit enhancements through 2025. let me give you a statistic that is compelling. madam speaker, 100 percent of the children in massachusetts have health insurance, and 97 percent of the adults in massachusetts have health insurance. it polls extraordinarily well in terms of its success ratios because we decided--labor, business, democrat, and republican--to make it work, and we did. these enhanced premium credits, first enacted by the american rescue plan, have made way for record-low uninsured rates that have put hundreds of dollars back into the pockets of low- and middle-income americans. this legislation will also make the largest investment in tackling climate [[page h7660]] change that our nation has ever witnessed. the investments in clean energy, energy efficiency, and clean manufacturing will generate 9 million good-paying jobs. these historic wins are achieved with sensible and responsible multiyear investments in the irs. i have been a member of the ways and means committee, madam speaker, for 30 years. let me give our friends an interesting statistic about the american family. we have the highest voluntary compliance rate in the world. eighty-six percent of the american people pay their taxes. this idea that we are creating 87,000 armed representatives of the federal government to go out and harass the american people is nonsensical. retirements alone are going to require a substantive investment. the irs has fewer than 20 percent of the employees that it once did. what is important to remember here is this: we want to make sure with this investment in the irs that we continue to have a high voluntary compliance rate and also to invest in the necessary technology that will allow the modeling to make sure compliance remains with us, as well. these are historical investments and achievements, and they also are going to continue our quest on the democratic side here for an element of tax fairness that will hold people at the very top as responsible as the other side likes to hold people who receive the eitc tax credit in terms of their request for audits. we do this simply by asking the most powerful among us to pay their fair share. this is what a full and fair tax administration is about. the american people have been through an unthinkable hardship over the last 2\1/2\ years, but they entrusted joe biden and congressional democrats to keep them safe and to rebuild our economy. here is a fact: on march 11, 2020, dr. fauci gave his warning. he warned us of what was coming. in april 2020, america had lost 22 million jobs. here we are, 2 years later, in the biden administration, and every job has been returned. there are 10.6 million jobs that go unanswered right now in the american economy. we have bounced back faster than we imagined. not only have all these jobs been returned, but for 51 straight days, gasoline prices have fallen. that is an issue about supply and demand, by the way. it is about international events, including the russian invasion of ukraine and supply chains across the world. those chains that i have just referenced have been shored up, and retailers are starting to realistically address some speculation as it relates to price. democrats should not be asked to do this alone, but we are being asked to do it today alone. we are going to hear a lot of washington talk from folks on the other side that want to address the politics of the situation rather than cap the cost of insulin for their constituents. they want to protect the pocketbooks of those who would raise prescription drug prices unnecessarily and cut costs for workers and their families, which we intend to do. you are going to hear a lot of spin on this bill that has received a lot of endorsements, even from bipartisan former treasury secretaries, but that is because the opponents are out of options. the inflation reduction act sets our nation on a healthier, fairer, and more prosperous path. we have heard the calls of the american people, and with the inflation reduction act, we continue to win this moment for them in its totality. madam speaker, i urge our colleagues to support this legislation, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, i join chairman neal in expressing our heartbreak and sorrow in losing congresswoman jackie walorski, our colleague, as well as zachery and emma. she was so proud of her team walorski folks. the truth of the matter is, jackie lit up every room she was in with her passion and her brilliance and her friendship and warmness. there is no question she could do everything. she was all in on everything and worked hard to find common ground wherever she could. last week was a shocking week and a week to mourn. this week is a time to celebrate jackie, her legacy, and her life. sadly, this massive senate bill, drawn in secret, stuffed with government checks to the wealthy and favored interests, and rushed through congress is a hoax on the american people. it fails to reduce inflation, fails to reduce the budget deficit, and fails to reduce the world's temperature. who in their right mind raises taxes in a recession? the answer is only president biden and his supporters in congress who bungled this economic recovery think that is a good idea. you remember them. they told you they would defeat covid, that inflation was a rich person's problem, that their $2 trillion spending spree last spring would strengthen the economy. instead, what did their promises deliver? the worst inflation in 40 years, a recession, and a crippling worker shortage that continues to hammer main street businesses. today, we have a shrinking economy, shrinking paychecks, and a shrinking workforce. families are skipping meals, running up credit card debt to pay for daily essentials, delaying retirement, and struggling to afford gas just to drive to work. yet, democrats today insist inflation does not even exist. they say it is zero. the truth is, most americans have lost confidence in president biden's failed handling of the economy. by contrast, the majority of the jobs in the covid recovery came under president trump, and under republican leadership, paychecks grew twice as fast as prices. the economy was surging, not shrinking like it is today, and 600,000 more americans were working than today under this unpopular white house. why would you trust the same democrats responsible for this cruel economy with another of their misguided spending bills? while other countries are lowering taxes to fight inflation, democrats imposed over $350 billion in taxes that land on local manufacturers that build right here in america. it will kill jobs, slow the economy, and raise prices even higher. small businesses, which hire nearly half of all workers in america, get hammered with $50 billion in new taxes. senior citizens and savers will bear the impact of $74 billion in new taxes that punish companies from investing in their stock value. all these taxes will hurt the economy, drive inflation further, and harm workers' paychecks, according to the independent tax foundation. democrats promise that no american will ``see a penny'' of tax hikes, yet congress' own budget office debunks that claim, confirming the largest burden of higher taxes will come from middle-class families starting next year. president biden is violating his own pledge not to raise taxes on middle-class americans. he is denying that truth. yesterday, house democrats insisted there are no new irs agents funded in this bill. read their lips: no new irs agents. they say it is all fearmongering, and they are just hiring replacements. unfortunately, the fact is the irs budget already budgets for those who are leaving through attrition, and the treasury department itself outlines the next decade of adding 87,000 new irs agents. that is what this bill unleashes. in fact, the congressional budget office reports ``audit rates will increase for every income level,'' that almost 90 percent of unreported tax income comes from who? the middle class. how will democrats collect $204 billion in more taxes? with thousands of new agents targeting what i would call walmart shoppers. you know them. they are real, hardworking american families. they are my constituents. they are my neighbors in my district. they are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling with inflation and higher gas prices. they will be hit with over 700,000 new audits, thanks to a skyrocketing surge in irs agents. maybe that is why democrats blocked any language in the senate that protects walmart shoppers and other value-shopping families against [[page h7661]] these new irs audits. but, man, this bill, they love the wealthy. if the green new deal and corporate welfare had a baby, it would look like this. nearly one-quarter of a trillion dollars in green new deal subsidies, government handouts, go to the wealthy and to the biggest, most successful businesses in america. look at this: a single working mom will pay higher taxes so they can be sent in a government check to wealthy investors and massive corporations. a yardman will send his taxes in a government check to the very well-to-do family whose lawn he is cutting so they can splurge on an $80,000 luxury electric vehicle. incredibly, to fund all these government handouts, every senate democrat and the vice president chose to impose higher taxes on small businesses so that millionaires and billionaires would be protected from higher state and local taxes. everyone facing devastating diseases like cancer, alzheimer's, als, and parkinson's will pay a deadly price. this crazy bill increases the cost of healthcare and medicines and kills new lifesaving cures while providing obamacare subsidies for the wealthy and those choosing not to return to work, making the worker shortage harsher. congress' nonpartisan scorekeeper, the penn wharton school of business, and the university of chicago all confirm the government price-fixing scheme could be a death sentence for patients, raising the costs of new drugs, crushing innovation, and killing hundreds of cures. higher taxes, harassing irs audits on our walmart shoppers, no relief from inflation, all as america battles a recession. let me ask again: do you really trust the same president and democrats who drove this economy into recession and drove prices sky high with yet another spending spree? madam speaker, i strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the very accomplished gentleman from connecticut (mr. larson). mr. larson of connecticut. madam speaker, i start by echoing the sentiments that both the chairman and the ranking member had about jackie walorski and how deeply we all feel for her and her family and the staff members who were lost. i congratulate mr. neal and also members of this committee, most notably mr. thompson and mr. blumenauer, as well, for their work on climate change and for their work throughout this period of putting forward consequential legislation. i say ``consequential'' in the time i am allotted because i want to talk and focus specifically on some of these claims. i hope the american people are listening. you do not bring about change by appealing to the sum total of the fears of the american people. you bring about change aspirationally and by doing something constructive and putting forward legislation as opposed to putting forward the collective fears of a nation and hoping that you might be able to exploit those fears for political gain. the myth that there are 87,000 irs agents, even trump's former person rejects that. it is nonsense, as mr. neal has pointed out. what matters to people is when you help them directly, like rod yearwood in west hartford, connecticut, who is paying $1,400 a month for his insurance, but now, under this bill, is paying $20 a month. the real savings he gets from that allows him to provide for a college education for his children. aspiration. {time} 1330 mr. brady. madam speaker, i include in the record page 16 of the department of the treasury's tax compliance plan, which shows the agency intends to hire 87,000 new irs employees. restoring irs resources the first step in the president's efforts to restore irs enforcement capability is a sustained, multi-year commitment to rebuilding the irs. this involves spending nearly $80 billion on irs priorities over the course of the decade including hiring new specialized enforcement staff, modernizing antiquated information technology, and investing in meaningful taxpayer service--including the implementation of the newly expanded credits aimed at providing support to american families. importantly, the additional resources will go toward enforcement against those with the highest incomes, and audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for those earning less than $400,000 in actual income. the president's proposal includes two components: a dedicated stream of mandatory funds ($72.5 billion over a decade) and a program integrity allocation ($6.7 billion over a decade). these mechanisms provide for a sustained, multi- year commitment to revitalizing the irs that will give the agency the certainty it needs to rebuild. the irs proposal includes year-by-year estimates of the additional resources that will be directed toward the agency as well as the specific activities that these resources would support. the design ensures that the irs is able to absorb and usefully deploy additional resources over the entire 10- year horizon and keeps budget growth manageable at around 10 percent per year. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from oklahoma (mr. hern). mr. hern. i rise today in strong opposition to the bill before us today. never in our history has the federal government responded to a recession by raising taxes on americans. it is simply unthinkable. nearly everything our colleagues across the aisle have said about this bill has been proven false. i have noticed they have stopped calling it the inflation legislation because they know it is not true. they are hailing it as a climate and tax plan. i will give them that because this legislation will raise american taxes and give that money to handpicked socialist green companies. i would not be proud of that if i were them. what this bill will absolutely do is not reduce inflation. in fact, even liberal economists are warning it will do the exact opposite. just today, 56 percent of democrats and 91 percent of independents are now gravely concerned with the direction of our economy. i have received thousands of phone calls, text messages, and emails from my constituents over the last week pleading with me to stop this bill from passing. they understand what half of this chamber does not. when the federal government spends more, american families have less. i find nothing redeemable in this legislation and, therefore, i urge my colleagues to vote a resounding ``no.'' mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from oregon (mr. blumenauer), who has had a profound influence on the renewable energy part of this legislation. mr. blumenauer. madam speaker, i thank the chairman, and i appreciate his leadership and his courtesy. madam speaker, this legislative package is something that refuses to die. it will reduce inflation, lower energy costs, and lower the cost of prescription drugs. but it is not just about inflation, it is about addressing the climate crisis and the crisis of confidence in government. last week, president biden met with some of the foremost experts on the presidency and american democracy to better understand the critical state that we are now in with the future of our democracy and how we avoid its destruction. we have our moment of making american history now. it is our moment for the future of our planet, for our children and grandchildren, and ourselves. i am pleased to have worked for over a decade on these provisions dealing with green energy, investment tax credits, energy efficiency in commercial buildings, and legislation to make polluters pay by reinstating the superfund tax. seniors and working families will see significant savings by allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices and capping the monthly cost of prescriptions, something the republicans made illegal in 2004. and critically, it takes steps to restore the ability of the irs to function, closing the $400 billion tax gap and not making the american public pay for poor customer service because of their mindless attack on this important institution. because the inflation reduction act represents more than the sum of these individual provisions, it is proof that our system works and that the united states has the capacity to solve our most pressing challenges in the years ahead just when we need it most. mr. brady. madam speaker, i include in the record a cbo letter, [[page h7662]] which confirms the affordable care act subsidies will boost inflation and reduce the incentive for people to work. u.s. congress, congressional budget office, washington, dc, august 4, 2022. re economic analysis of budget reconciliation legislation hon. lindsey graham, ranking member, committee on the budget, u.s. senate, washington, dc. dear senator: yesterday, the congressional budget office published a cost estimate for h.r. 5376, the inflation reduction act of 2022, which is the latest version of the reconciliation legislation in the senate.\1\ this letter provides answers to four questions you asked related to that bill and broader economic conditions. is the united states currently in a recession? the u.s. economy shows signs of slowing, but whether the economy is currently in a recession is difficult to say. it is possible that, in retrospect, it will become apparent that the economy moved into recession sometime this year. however, that is not clear from data that were available at the beginning of august. some key metrics indicate a decline in economic activity as the first half of this year progressed, whereas others indicate continued growth, though generally at a slower rate than previously. real gross domestic product (that is, gdp adjusted to remove the effects of inflation) and industrial production have both declined. in particular, real gdp declined by an average of 1.25 percent (at an annual rate) in the first two quarters of 2022. industrial production grew from january to april, was essentially unchanged in may, and then declined in june. other key indicators of economic activity have continued to increase in the first half of 2022, though generally at a slower rate than they had previously. for instance, real gross domestic income (gdi) increased at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the first quarter of 2022 after growing by an average rate of 6.3 percent in the second half of 2021.\2\ (second-quarter data for gdi are not yet available.) real personal income minus transfer payments to people by federal, state, and local governments grew at an average annual rate of 0.5 percent in the first half of 2022 versus 3.1 percent in the second half of 2021. and real personal consumption expenditures grew at an average annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first half of 2022 (with somewhat slower growth in the second quarter than in the first), compared with 2.2 percent in the second half of 2021. one reason for the deceleration in personal consumption expenditures is higher inflation, which has eroded consumers' purchasing power. another reason is that real disposable personal income has declined in the first half of 2022. savings accumulated during the coronavirus pandemic, including from transfer payments, have continued to support consumption. the labor market remains tight, with low unemployment and elevated job vacancies, but both measures have softened in recent months. net gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged 375,000 jobs per month in the second quarter of 2022 compared with 539,000 jobs, on net, added per month in the first quarter and 590,000 jobs, on net, added per month in the second half of 2021. in june 2022, the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent (unchanged since march and near its prepandemic low) and there were about 1.8 job vacancies for every unemployed worker (one of the highest readings in the near 22-year history of this series though down from its highest level of 2.0 in march). how would enacting the bill affect inflation in 2022 and 2023? in calendar year 2022, enacting the bill would have a negligible effect on inflation, in cbo's assessment. in calendar year 2023, inflation would probably be between 0.1 percentage point lower and 0.1 percentage point higher under the bill than it would be under current law, cbo estimates. that range of likely outcomes reflects uncertainty about how various provisions of the bill would affect overall demand and output, the supply of labor, the persistence of disruptions in the supply of goods and services, and how the federal reserve would respond to offset any increase in inflationary pressure. responsiveness to the enhancement of health insurance subsidies established by the affordable care act is the most important factor boosting inflationary pressure, and responsiveness to the new alternative minimum tax on corporations is the most important factor reducing inflationary pressure. the range applies to multiple measures of inflation: the gdp price index, the personal consumption expenditures price index, and the consumer price index for all urban consumers. in its analysis of the inflationary effects of the bill, cbo used an approach similar to that underlying the agency's estimates of the short-term effects of legislation enacted in 2021.\3\ the agency augmented its analysis to account for the effects of supply disruptions and for the amount of tightness or slack in the economy on the inflationary effects of fiscal policy. key inputs into the analysis of inflation were the effects of the bill on overall demand for goods and services. in the short term, changes in fiscal policies affect the economy primarily by influencing the demand for goods and services by consumers, businesses, and governments, which leads to changes in output. factors increasing overall demand push inflation up and those decreasing overall demand push inflation down. to estimate the effects of changes in federal spending and revenues on overall demand and output, cbo considered evidence about the effects of similar policies in the past and used results produced by macroeconomic models.\4\ cbo expects different provisions of the legislation to affect overall demand and output differently.\5\ for example, provisions that directly increase government purchases of goods and services would add to overall demand on a dollar- for-dollar basis. increases in financial support to people, such as through enhanced health insurance subsidies, would boost spending more among lower-income people than among higher-income people, partly because lower-income households typically consume a higher fraction of their additional disposable income than higher-income households do. thus, financial assistance to lower-income households would boost the overall demand for goods and services more than financial assistance to higher-income households would. changes to business taxes that affect after-tax profits on past investments--as opposed to the return on new investments-- would have relatively small effects on overall demand, in cbo's assessment. cbo used its estimates of the bill's net effects on the deficit as the starting point for its analysis of overall effects on demand (see table 1). the enhanced health insurance subsidies and energy-related subsidies were the largest contributors to increases in the deficit. the new alternative minimum tax on corporations was the largest contributor to reductions in the deficit. for each dollar change in the deficit, the increases in subsidies would probably have larger effects on overall demand (boosting it) than the increases in revenues (which would reduce overall demand). those factors could contribute to the effects on output and inflation being positive even when the overall deficit was reduced. table 1--net increases and decreases (-) in the deficit from the inflation reduction act of 2022 [billions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

h.r. 5376, as amended in the nature of a substitute (ern22335) and posted on the website of the senate majority leader on july 27, 2022. components may not sum to totals because of rounding. the budgetary effects in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 informed cbo's analysis of the economic effects in calendar year 2023. the analysis included the effects on the deficit from higher revenues resulting from increased funding for the internal revenue service. under guidelines agreed to by the legislative and executive branches, those effects are not included in the total line from cbo's cost estimate reporting the net effect on the deficit. thus, the effects shown in the memorandum are additional. those revenues constitute a shift in resources from the private sector to the government that would reduce demand and thus reduce inflationary pressure. enacting the bill would also reduce some businesses' incentives to invest through changes in the after-tax return on private investment, pushing down output and inflation. (see the answer to the fourth question in this letter for further discussion.) in addition, enacting the bill would reduce the incentives of some people to work, mainly because of the enhanced health insurance subsidies, pushing down output and pushing up inflation. enacting the bill would affect economic activity and inflation beyond 2023. cbo has not evaluated those effects. what is the highest amount of income that people qualifying for expanded health insurance subsidies would earn? the answer to your question depends on people's age and geographic location, and the number of enrollees in the family. on the basis of nationwide average premiums projected for 2023 under the bill, cbo estimates the following: a 64-year-old would receive a premium tax credit if his or her income did not exceed $163,700 in that year. a 21-year-old would receive a premium tax credit if his or her income did not exceed $54,600. a family of four consisting of individuals ages 50, 50, 21, and 21 would receive a premium tax credit if their household income was no greater than $304,100. a younger family of four, consisting of people ages 24, 24, 5, and 5, would receive a premium tax credit if the household's income was no more than $192,700. premium tax credits are used to lower people's out-of- pocket monthly premium contributions for health insurance obtained through the marketplaces established by the affordable care act. the amount of the credit is calculated as the difference between the benchmark premium for health insurance (that is, the premium for the second-lowest-cost silver plan available in a region) for the individual or family and a specified maximum contribution, expressed as a percentage of modified adjusted gross income. those benchmark premiums are also a function of age, geographic location, and the number of enrollees. for example, the premium for a 64- year-old is three times that for a 21-year-old in most states. the premium tax credit is [[page h7663]] thus correspondingly larger for older people than for younger people. the likelihood that the benchmark premium will exceed a person's maximum contribution--and that the person will therefore receive a premium tax credit--declines at higher income levels. for those whose income is above 400 percent of the federal poverty guideline, or $54,400 for a single person in 2023, their maximum contribution would be 8.5 percent of income through 2025 under the bill. this analysis is based on nationwide average premiums. for people living in states with premiums that are above or below the average, the income at which they would no longer be eligible for a premium tax credit would be higher or lower. what effect would a new alternative minimum tax on corporations have on business investment and gdp? section 10101 of h.r. 5376 would increase taxes on corporations by imposing a new alternative minimum tax equal to 15 percent of income reported on financial statements by certain large corporations--specifically, those whose adjusted financial statement income exceeds $1 billion. the staff of the joint committee on taxation (jct) estimates that the provision would increase federal revenues by $313.1 billion over the 2023-2031 period (with $96.6 billion of that amount being generated in fiscal years 2023 and 2024). jct has projected that approximately 150 corporations would be subject to the new tax each year and that just under half of the revenues would come from the manufacturing sector.\6\ in cbo's assessment, the proposed new corporate minimum tax would reduce the incentive for those large corporations to invest, primarily by limiting the tax benefit of accelerated depreciation and by decreasing the after-tax return on their new investment. according to the generally accepted accounting principles that are used for preparing financial statements, firms must deduct the cost of investments over the full useful life of the asset. in contrast, various provisions of the tax code--including ``bonus'' depreciation--allow firms to deduct investment expenses more quickly, increasing the tax benefit of those deductions and the expected after-tax return on the investments. by setting a new minimum tax, section 10101 would limit the tax benefit of accelerated depreciation for affected corporations and, all else being equal, reduce their business investment. the provision would also affect private investment by increasing federal revenues and, all else being equal, by reducing the federal deficit and the amount of federal debt. less government borrowing would increase the amount of funds available for private investment and put downward pressure on interest rates, which would have a positive effect on business investment, in cbo's view. the net effect on business investment, and hence on gdp, would depend on the relative magnitudes of the direct incentive effect and the indirect effect resulting from the change in the federal budget deficit. additionally, the net effect would depend on overall economic conditions. other provisions of the inflation reduction act would also affect incentives to invest. thus, the legislation's overall impact on business investment and gdp would differ from that of just this provision considered by itself. i hope that this information is useful to you. sincerely, phillip l. swagel, director.

madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. arrington). mr. arrington. madam speaker, the last time my democrat colleagues used reconciliation to jam through a massive partisan spending spree, it was under the pretense of covid recovery. not only did they ``fail to rescue america,'' they destroyed our recovery efforts and sent us spiraling into recession. now, in the aftermath of their self-inflicted economic disaster, my democrat colleagues' response is to run the same play and expect a different result. another false promise under the guise of a grandiose title, the inflation reduction act. nobody in america, madam speaker, believes that this bill will reduce inflation. in fact, it is going to make inflation worse by imposing massive tax hikes on u.s. job creators, strangling domestic oil and gas production, unleashing an army of tens of thousands of irs agents to shake down working families and small businesses, handing out hundreds of billions of dollars in green new deal giveaways that will jeopardize america's energy security, putting america in the same position of weakness as our european allies. mark my words, madam speaker, this bill will further fuel inflation, deepen our recession, cripple our competitiveness, and increase costs at the pump. mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. kind), who is retiring but has made many valued contributions to our nation and committee. mr. kind. madam speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. madam speaker, as a dear friend of jackie walorski, i share in the grief of her passing and her staff's passing. it is very tragic. madam speaker, this inflation reduction act is historic legislation. it puts people over politics by lowering families' kitchen-table costs from prescription drugs to their energy expenses, creates millions of good-paying jobs, delivers the most significant action to combat climate change when mother nature is screaming at us to take action today, and it substantially reduces the deficit by over $300 billion. now, on that last point, madam speaker, not once has a republican-led congress brought a reconciliation bill to the floor that was paid for, let alone reduces the national deficit. in fact, as an example, when they passed their prescription drug bill in 2004, not only did they not pay for it, not one nickel of it was offset. over $400 billion, the largest expansion of entitlement funding since the creation of social security and medicare, but there were no offsets. when we passed the affordable care act a little over 10 years ago, not only did we pay for it, but we also reduced the deficit. just this week, it was announced that health uninsured rates is at an all-time historic low for our country, no less due to that affordable care act. madam speaker, they made that prescription drug bill even worse when they passed it by inserting language in it that specifically made it illegal for us to discuss prices or negotiate prices with the drug companies. this bill changes that today by allowing once and for all some price negotiation with the drug companies to deliver real relief for our seniors. madam speaker, i encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. mr. brady. madam speaker, i include in the record the joint committee on taxation analysis that shows that families earning $75,000 or $100,000 are four times more likely to have a tax hike under this bill than a tax cut. nonpartisan tax scorekeeper: average working family is more likely to be worse off than better off under democrats' tax plan working families will be worse off under democrats' higher taxes, according to a new analysis from the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation. this is another devastating blow for families after the congressional budget office revealed that democrats' supercharged irs expects to grab $20 billion from lower- and middle-income earners. working families at high risk of tax hikes democrats have once again tried to hide the real effects of this bill. new analysis from the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation (jct) shows that the average working family is more likely to be worse-off than better-off under democrats' tax plan. for median-income families earning $50,000-$75,000, households are 33 percent more likely to have a tax hike than a tax cut. it gets worse for every dollar earned--families earning $75,000-$100,000 are four times more likely to have a tax hike than a tax cut, and families earning $100,000-$200,000 are more than ten times more likely to have a tax hike than a tax cut. the bill does nothing--or makes things worse--for regular working families. more than 92 percent of households with incomes under $200,000 get no benefit--or a tax hike--under democrats' bill. what is more, these tax hikes on working families do not include the bill's superfund or methane taxes on american energy, which disproportionately harm middle- and lower- income households through higher prices at the pump and bigger utility bills. [[page h7664]] high-income households enjoy big benefits the jct analysis shows the landscaping company owner and his workers pay more, while the wealthy homeowner gets checks from washington for the solar panels on their roof. that is because the ``winners'' under democrat's tax plan are the earners at the very top. democrat's reckless spending plan includes more than $250 billion in green new deal subsidies that benefit the wealthy the most. the percentage of $1 million-plus households getting a tax cut (19.4 percent) is twice as high as any other income group. the group with the next highest proportion of tax cuts is those earning $500,000-$1 million. over the long term, 72.5 percent of households with income over $1 million will receive a tax cut. more bad news: $10.6 billion in tax hikes on working families next year separate analysis by jct isolates the effects of democrats' tax plan without the obamacare subsidies that flow to a limited number of households in an attempt to bribe them into one-size-fits-all obamacare plans. in 2023, democrats would increase the total tax burden on americans under $200,000 in income by $10.6 billion. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from tennessee (mr. kustoff). mr. kustoff. madam speaker, i thank the ranking member for yielding. madam speaker, i rise today in strong opposition to what the democrats call the inflation reduction act which is really the inflation expansion act. americans are grappling with an economy in recession and the highest inflation that we have seen in 40 years. we are experiencing worker shortages, empty grocery shelves, and higher energy prices. now congressional democrats are doubling down on this out-of-control spending that led to this economic crisis. this package that we are voting on today will raise taxes on hardworking, middle-class families. it will authorize 87,000 new irs agents to target individuals and small businesses. it will reduce lifesaving healthcare innovation by allowing the government to impose price controls on drugs. it will hurt energy producers. and it will certainly worsen inflation. i am voting against this fundamentally flawed and defective package because families, farmers, and small businesses across west tennessee and across the nation need real solutions to these problems, not more taxes and not more government spending. mr. neal. madam speaker, the bill we are considering in the house today, the inflation reduction act, started in the house of representatives as the build back better act. three years ago, all democratic members of the ways and means committee introduced the green act as the committee's consensus legislation for tax priorities relating to climate, clean energy, and energy efficiency. the green act was reintroduced, again with all ways and means democrats, in the 117th congress. the green act formed the base of the climate and energy subtitle of the build back better act, which the ways and means committee marked up in september 2021 and passed out of the house, following significant input from the senate, in november 2021. many provisions of subtitle d of the inflation reduction act remain substantially similar to those that the house developed and passed. as the chairman of the ways and means committee, i wish to offer additional detail on the legislative intent behind certain provisions included in this legislation. this legislation provides long-term extensions of tax credits for renewable technologies such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower by extending section 45 and section 48 and enacting their successor credits under sec. 45y and section 48e. these provisions were drafted with the goal of unleashing clean energy deployment, in line with president biden's pledge of a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030. additionally, this legislation provides enhanced credit amounts for projects additional goals, such as those meeting domestic content requirements or located in energy communities. currently, these renewable energy tax credits often remain out of reach for low-income communities, which disproportionately bear the burden of pollution. the committee believes that our renewable energy deployment should align with president biden's justice40 initiative, which aims to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of federal investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities. to achieve these goals, we must bring all resources to bear across all agencies--the department of the treasury, the department of energy, the environmental protection agency, the white house council on environmental quality, and more. for example, the council on environmental quality has developed a tool to assist federal agencies with best targeting resources towards disadvantaged communities. this goal is closely aligned with a provision that i am proud to have worked with rep. danny davis to include in this legislation. h.r. 5183, provides an enhanced investment tax credit for projects in connection with low-income communities, and is included in new section 45(e) and section 48e(h) in this legislation. it draws on the success in california of a clean energy program that helps hundreds of thousands of low-income residents in multifamily housing enjoy the cost savings and environmental advantages of solar. this program provides allocated bonus credits for projects benefiting low-income residents, including multifamily housing, community solar, and individual low-income residential homeowners. the committee intends that the program prioritize low-income individuals and communities throughout the selection process. low-income individuals can benefit from this legislation in multiple ways, including in the form of lower electricity bills, reduction in locally harmful air pollution, inclusive economic opportunities through training and employment on such projects, and benefits to the community proven through active engagement and outreach to community members. thus, in selecting projects for allocation, the committee intends for the secretary to take into account which projects demonstrate the greatest health and economic benefits for disadvantaged individuals (including benefits related to the ability to withstand extreme weather events); the greatest employment and wages for such individuals; and the greatest engagement with and outreach to such individuals, including through partnerships with local governments, community-based organizations, and indian tribal governments. additionally, this legislation is designed to provide maximum flexibility to the secretary in designing an efficient application and allocation process to meet the needs of low-income residents. specifically, the legislation is intended to allow residential rooftop providers to identify potential customers in qualifying census tracts and submit applications to serve these customers up-front, before these businesses have contractually engaged these customers. my understanding is that these businesses will need to know if they have received a credit allocation before they can offer the benefits of the credit to these customers so that businesses can provide customers accurate pricing information and cost savings to low-income customers. this legislation also makes several important additions to the property eligible under the section 48 investment tax credit and its successor credit, section 48e. the first is the addition of energy storage technologies. this provision originated as h.r. 1684, the energy storage tax incentive and deployment, as advanced by representatives mike doyle and earl blumenauer, and included in the green act and the build back better act. it is the committee's intent that the technologies included in h.r. 1684, such as pumped hydropower, are considered energy storage technologies for this legislation. pumped-storage hydroelectric facilities are sometimes called water batteries. electricity is used to pump water from a lower to an upper reservoir. when needed, this water is then released and run through turbines to convert the stored energy back into electricity. the definition of energy storage technologies includes ``property . . . which receives, stores, and delivers energy for conversion to electricity'' under new section 48(c)(6)(a)(i). thus, it is the committee's intent such property not only include the two reservoirs as well as the pipe and pump to move the water uphill, but also the turbines and step-up transformer to convert the stored energy back into electricity. additionally, relating to the coordination of the credit for energy storage technologies and the section 45 production tax credit, the committee intends that a credit is allowed for energy storage technology under section 48 regardless of whether it is part of a facility for which a credit under section 45 is or has been allowed. the second is the addition of electrochromatic glass, also known as dynamic glass, to section 48(a)(3)(a)(ii). it is the committee's intent that the basis for such property should include the cost of the glass itself including the devices, the wiring and other components necessary for the glass to change its light transmittance properties, as well as the window frame and the capitalized costs for the installation of these and any other related components. additionally, this legislation creates new section 45w, the credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles, to incentivize clean vehicles and mobile machinery. in including mobile [[page h7665]] machinery, the committee intends to incentivize cleaner farm equipment, construction equipment, and other equipment. as the secretary develops regulations or other guidance to carry out the purposes of this section, the committee believes it is appropriate to consider industry standards when applying rules in the section that reference vehicles. for example, the secretary may look established methods of determining equipment weight for purposes of determining credit limits based upon gross vehicle weights and may allow, as a substitute, other commonly used identification or serial numbers when administering the vehicle identification number requirements. this legislation is historic, and i look forward to seeing the impact these, and the many other clean energy incentives contained in this bill, have on our carbon reduction goals in the coming years. mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pascrell), who is always pleased to let us know what he is thinking. mr. pascrell. madam speaker, i thank the chairman for yielding. madam speaker, the american people put democrats in charge to raise our nation from its knees--unless we have short memories. we are putting people over powerful interests. we are rebuilding our economy for working families. we are providing historically low healthcare premiums for nearly 12 million americans, including over 20,000 in my own district of new jersey. we are making the single largest investment in clean energy to secure a livable future. our planet is at the precipice of catastrophe. so we are combating climate change and creating 9 million jobs in the process. not bad, madam speaker, not bad. our bill includes legislation i happen to champion to expand zero- emission nuclear energy and offshore wind, where new jersey leads the way. i worked on a bipartisan basis on those two issues, and there is nothing said today about that by my friends on the other side. for years, republicans sabotaged the irs. the record is clear. they safeguarded loopholes to help a privileged few pay a pittance in taxes. and that ends today. five years ago, republicans passed a $2 trillion tax scam for the rich and the corporate tycoons. today, we are closing the tax gap and providing tax fairness. democrats are making prescription drugs affordable. democrats are lowering healthcare costs. god bless our great country. mr. brady. madam speaker, i include in the record a letter from the congressional budget office, which confirms this bill will actually increase the cost of new drugs. u.s. congress, congressional budget office, washington, dc, august 4, 2022. re additional information about prescription drug legislation hon. jason smith, ranking member, committee on the budget, u.s. house of representatives, washington, dc. dear congressman: this letter provides additional information that you and your colleagues requested about subtitle i of the reconciliation recommendations of the senate committee on finance regarding prescription drug legislation. you asked about how provisions involving inflation rebates and the negotiation of drug prices would affect launch prices for new drugs and the introduction of new generic drugs. you also asked how a provision to stabilize premiums as a part of the redesign of medicare's benefits would affect the federal budget and premiums. effect of the inflation-rebate and negotiation provisions on launch prices the congressional budget office projects that the inflation-rebate and negotiation provisions would increase the launch prices for drugs that are not yet on the market relative to what such prices would be otherwise. that effect would primarily be driven by the inflation-rebate provisions (sections 129101 and 129102), which would begin to apply to prices within 12 months of a given drug's entering the market. under those provisions, manufacturers would have an incentive to launch new drugs at a higher price to offset slower growth in prices over time. the negotiation provision (section 129001) would have less of an impact on launch prices, cbo expects: although the ceiling for a drug's negotiated price is based on its price from a prior year, negotiation could not occur until drugs were on the market for a number of years--at least 7 for small-molecule drugs and 11 for biologics. higher launch prices would primarily affect spending for drugs in the medicaid program, cbo projects, because an increase in that program's basic rebate brought about by the higher launch prices would only partly offset those prices. higher launch prices would also tend to affect spending for drugs covered by part b of the medicare program because that program's payments for those drugs are based on the average sales prices. over time, slower price growth would attenuate the effect of higher launch prices. in the commercial and medicare part d segments of the market, spending would be less affected by higher launch prices, cbo estimates, because manufacturers would have more flexibility to manage rebates to maximize their revenues in those sectors. effect of the negotiation provision on the introduction of new generic drugs cbo has not analyzed the effects of the negotiation provision on the introduction of new generic drugs. in projecting the effects of the negotiation provision, cbo estimated the share of spending that would be subject to negotiation each year and the average reduction in prices that would stem from the negotiations. but the agency did not analyze how the provision would affect prices or spending on specific drugs, nor did it quantify any impact on the introduction of new generic drugs. effects of the premium-stabilization provision under the premium-stabilization provision (section 129201), the federal government would subsidize any growth in beneficiaries' base premiums for medicare part d exceeding 6 percent from one year to the next over the 2024-2029 period. the provision subsequently would lower the base premium percentage (the percentage of the average cost of standard part d coverage that is used to calculate beneficiaries' premiums) to ensure that premiums did not grow by more than 6 percent between 2029 and 2030. that subsidy and subsequent reduction in premiums would increase federal spending by roughly $40 billion over the 2024-2031 period, cbo estimates. beneficiaries' spending on premiums would be lower under the premium-stabilization provision than it would be without it. that estimate is an average effect among the possible paths of premiums that cbo considered when modeling the uncertainty of future outcomes. under some of those paths, premiums would grow by less than 6 percent a year, and the provision would have no cost; under others, premiums would grow faster, and the provision would generate costs. i hope this information is useful to you and your colleagues. please contact me if you have further questions. sincerely, phillip l. swagel, director. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from arizona (mr. schweikert), my colleague on the committee on ways and means. mr. schweikert. madam speaker, for everyone here, this is a subsidy bill. and this is the classic difference between the left and the right. they are functionally subsidizing. we on the right actually want to change the market. we want competition. so i am going to pull out one very simple example. in here, we have $2.5 billion of subsidies for our ports to get greener and more efficient. but then the democrats slip in language that says human- operated, meaning you are not going to take on the unions, you are not actually going to make it more efficient, you are not going to actually embrace disruption and technology. we keep coming to the floor and talking about things that would make our ports greener, faster, more efficient, feed the supply chain--these electric rail cars, except you functionally just made them not happen. this is a subsidy for those unions, those folks who right checks to the left. you claim you are making the environment better and cleaner, but then you build the very barriers in the language that stop those good things from happening. mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. danny k. davis), one of the most talented members of the committee. mr. danny k. davis of illinois. madam speaker, i associate myself with the remarks made by my colleagues relative to our tragic loss of representative walorski who was the ranking member of the subcommittee that i chair. madam speaker, i rise in strong support of the inflation reduction act of 2022. this is the most transformative piece of legislation that i have seen. it lowers family healthcare costs, reduces drug and energy costs, makes the largest investment in addressing climate change in the history of this country, and cuts carbon emissions by 40 percent. [[page h7666]] this bill would create millions of good-paying, union jobs and stimulate economic growth and development across the nation. it incentivizes manufacturing and reduces our reliance upon foreign-made products. this bill does what we have been trying to do for years, and that is, it empowers medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs. millions of seniors and disabled individuals will benefit from this provision alone, not to mention what the monthly cap on the price of insulin would do for millions of others. madam speaker, this bill would cut the deficit and lower inflation, will not cost the average taxpayer one additional cent, unless they earn $400,000 annually or more. one feature of this bill that i am especially proud of is the enhanced tax credit to bring solar and wind energy to low-income communities. this tax credit will assist these communities. madam speaker, this is a great bill, and i urge its passage. mr. brady. madam speaker, i include in the record a congressional budget office report from this morning, while we were on the house floor, which confirms irs audits will generate tens of billions of dollars for middle-class families making less than $400,000. cbo has received a number of questions regarding our estimate of an amendment offered by senator crapo during the floor debate on h.r. 5376 last weekend. that amendment, #5404, would limit the use of additional funds for the internal revenue service. if the amendment had been adopted none of the additional funds could have been used to audit taxpayers with taxable incomes below $400,000. cbo did not complete a formal cost estimate in advance of consideration of the amendment but the agency did provide the following information to the senate budget committee: cbo estimates that the amendment 5404 would have the following effects: no effect on outlays in the one or ten year budget windows; would reduce outlays in the five year budget window. no effect on revenues in the one year budget window; would reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the provisions of section 10301 in the five and ten year budget windows. no effect on outlays after 2031 but would decrease the ``non-scorable'' revenue resulting from the provisions of section 10301 after 2031. cbo has not completed a point estimate of this amendment but the preliminary assessment indicates that amendment 5404 would reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the provisions of section 10301 by at least $20 billion over the fy2022-fy2031 period. thanks, leigh angres, director of legislative affairs, congressional budget office. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. kelly), my colleague from the committee on ways and means. {time} 1345 mr. kelly of pennsylvania. madam speaker, i thank my friend from texas, and i hate to see him leave because he has been so productive. madam speaker, it is interesting. we had the talk and hear it going back and forth about what the irs is not going to do. i would just tell my fellow citizens--and i am not going to talk to the other side because we should not be doing that anyway. there is something wrong whenever we look at the money that is being spent to hire agents for enforcement. i would tell my fellow citizens: be afraid. be very afraid. if the events of this week do not shake you to the bottom as to what this government can do to you whenever it chooses to do it and however it chooses to do it, understand that this agency, the irs, is the most feared agency in the united states government. it is incredible the power that it wields. it is incredible that it is going to increase the number of enforcement officers. they are not coming in to help with the processing because all of us in congress, including my friends on the other side, have been doing the work of the irs for the irs. they have not been back to work full time for 2\1/2\ years. madam speaker, i urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to vote ``no'' on this monstrosity that does not do anything about inflation but continues to harass hardworking american taxpayers. mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, this is misinformation about the irs. they need the funding to better serve the american people. the idea that, all of a sudden, there is an army of irs agents that is coming after the american family does not stand up under the magnifying glass of critical analysis. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from new york (mr. higgins), a really capable member of the ways and means committee. mr. higgins of new york. madam speaker, the 1970 clean air act was passed by a democratic-led congress and a republican president after millions of americans demanded change. five decades later, a new generation of americans is calling on congress to act on our nation's biggest challenges. the inflation reduction act is not just a good climate bill; it is also a major achievement. to address the climate crisis, it makes a $369 billion investment toward decarbonizing our nation. the bill addresses environmental justice. everyone should benefit from a cleaner environment, especially those who are vulnerable to disease because of where they live. the bill finally helps medicare negotiate a better deal on drug prices. this provision will save lives and help seniors enjoy their retirement without fear of poverty due to the cost of their medications. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which is vital to our nation's future. mr. brady. madam speaker, i include in the record the following report from 2020 from a group that tracks government spending, which details how the irs is currently armed with 4,600 guns and 5 million rounds of ammunition. that is not fear-mongering; these are the facts. irs has 4,600 guns and five milion rounds of ammo: will dem bill grow arsenal? the irs has 4,600 guns and five million rounds of ammunition according to a report from openthebooks published in 2020. with democrats on the verge of passing $80 billion in additional funding to facilitate the hiring of 87,000 new agents, how much will this arsenal grow? the democrats' push to increase the size and power of the irs has significant criminal justice and basic due process ramifications. an openthebooks report titled the militarization of u.s. executive agencies shows that, even without the proposed $80 billion increase in funding, the irs criminal investigation division (irs-ci) is already heavily armed at the expense of the american taxpayer. the current 4,600-gun stockpile includes: 3,282 pistols 621 shotguns 539 rifles 15 fully automatic firearms 4 revolvers according to the government accountability office the ammunition breakdown is as follows: pistol and revolver rounds: 3,151,500 rifle rounds: 1,472,050 shotgun rounds: 367,750 fully automatic firearm rounds: 56,000 when openthebooks directly asked the irs for an accounting of its gun locker, the agency responded, ``we do not have one [an inventory], but could create one for you, if important.'' there are seven reasons to be concerned about the irs having more power, more money, and more guns: 1. irs fails to ensure armed agents receive required firearms training in order to carry or use an irs-owned weapon, agents must: engage in handgun firing training at least once each quarter, shoot at least the minimum of 75 percentage points on the firearms qualifying test using the issued handgun during two nonconsecutive quarters, participate in biannual firearms building entry exercises, participate in an annual briefing on firearms safety and security policies and irs-ci's directives and procedures regarding the safe handling and storage of firearms, and participate in a briefing each quarter regarding the policy of discharging a firearm at a moving vehicle. irs-ci's national criminal investigation training academy (ncita) is responsible for implementing the formalized firearms training and qualification program nationwide. this includes developing the firearm qualification requirements they are expected to meet and the training special agents will undergo. despite these requirements, ci agents have regularly failed to stay up to date on training or report incidents, endangering the taxpayers they are supposed to protect. according to reports from the treasury inspector general for tax administration (tigta), the irs has repeatedly failed to ensure that procedures relating to firearms are properly followed: ``there is no national-level review of firearms training records to ensure that all special agents meet the qualification requirements.'' special agents are required to surrender their weapons when they fail to participate [[page h7667]] in this training, however this often does not happen. as noted by the inspector general: ``however, there is currently little consequence for special agents who fail to meet the training requirements listed on the checklist.'' the inspector general noted the irs failed to secure the firearms of those who did not meet their requirements: ``controls did not ensure that ci personnel properly secured firearms when special agents failed to meet the biannual standard qualification requirement. ci was only able to provide evidence that firearms were surrendered in nine of the 27 instances when special agents did not qualify. the criminal investigation management information system was only updated to reflect the custody change in four of those nine instances. the inspector general noted that the irs lapses torpedo its ability to effectively try cases: ``court decisions in the past have held law enforcement entities liable because their law enforcement agents did not have training that reflected the environment that they would likely encounter, such as training involving moving targets and low-light conditions. other court decisions underscored the importance of properly documenting firearms training. one decision dismissed the claims against a law enforcement entity that maintained thorough records that showed the law enforcement personnel had been trained. another decision upheld a jury's conclusion that undocumented police training did not constitute adequate training.'' the irs failure to conduct proper internal oversight of its weapons could have grave consequences for the public. as noted by the inspector general: ``if there is insufficient oversight, special agents in possession of firearms who are not properly trained and qualified could endanger other special agents and the public.'' 2. irs agents accidentally fire their weapons more often than they intentionally fire them a tigta report found that special agents at the irs criminal investigation division (irs-ci) accidentally fired their weapons more often than they intentionally fired them: ``according to documentation provided by all 26 ci field offices, the ncita, and the tigta oi, there were a total of eight firearm discharges classified as intentional use of force incidents and 11 discharges classified as accidental during fys 2009 through 2011.'' 3. irs conceals details of accidental gun discharges the agency's lackadaisical approach to firearm safety has led to easily preventable accidents. the inspector general cryptically references irs accidental discharges that caused ``property damage or personal injury'': ``in three of the four accidental discharges that were not reported, the accidental discharges may have resulted in property damage or personal injury.'' the details of these incidents are--for some reason-- redacted in the report: irs-ci management is required to be notified when a special agent discharges their weapon. ci must report all accidental discharge incidents externally to the tigta oi and internally to the ncita and the director of field operations. despite these directives, ci did not always properly disclose accidental discharges: ``we found that four accidental discharges were not properly reported. this included two that were not reported to both to the tigta oi and the ncita. one that was not reported to the tigta oi, and one that was not reported internally to the ncita.'' 4. irs agents do not always undergo remedial training after discharges due to agent negligence compounding their mistakes, agents did not always provide remedial training when an accidental discharge occurred. even when they did undergo training, the standards remained wildly inconsistent. the inspector general found that: ``two of the four use of force coordinators stated that they may require the special agent to participate in some type of remedial training, one stated that the special agent would be counseled, and one stated that there would be no additional training required.'' 5. irs has a history of violating basic due process rights in a 2017 report, the irs-ci was shown to have regularly violated taxpayers' rights and skirted or ignored due process requirements when investigating taxpayers for allegedly violating the existing $10,000 currency transaction reporting requirements tigta found that only 8 percent of investigations uncovered violations of tax law. in many cases, irs-ci had not considered reasonable explanations from those investigated, property owners were not adequately informed of their rights nor informed of seizure of their property, and outcomes in cases lacked consistency, violating the eighth amendment to the constitution. 6. irs has appalling evidence storage habits the irs criminal investigation division (irs-ci) was repeatedly found to leave critical evidence sitting around in break rooms, hallways and stacked outside cubicles, according to a report by the treasury inspector general for tax administration (tigta). in addition, the report found that ci offices did not maintain an evidence access control log to record access to areas where evidence is stored: during our walkthroughs at the ci offices, we observed that some sites had evidence placed in hallways. stacked outside cubicles, and in break rooms. in addition, seven of the nine offices did not keep grand jury material in a separate, secure area. the grand jury material was intermingled with non-grand jury evidence and other case file information. the agency's careless approach to evidence storage has grave ramifications, as noted by the inspector general: in order for a seized item to be admissible as evidence, it is necessary to prove that the item is in the same condition as when it was seized. if evidence is not stored properly, evidence may have been inappropriately disclosed, lost, tampered with, or stolen. in addition, the chain of custody could be called into question, which could result in the item being deemed inadmissible in court. the report suggests the irs is an outlier in terms of its sloppy handling of evidence, compared to other federal law enforcement agencies: in addition, we interviewed representatives from two other federal law enforcement agencies to gain an understanding of how they maintained their chain of custody. it was apparent from these interviews that both federal agencies have an extensive chain of custody process. for example, each agency limits access to the locked evidence room, which is maintained by an evidence custodian. if evidence needs to be removed from the room, an agent must gain access through the evidence custodian and a record of that access is maintained. this process helps ensure that evidence does not become lost or misplaced and helps keep the chain of custody from being broken. each irs-ci special agent has the authority to investigate, inquire, and receive information. of the investigative techniques available to agents, one of the most frequently used is the authority to conduct searches and issue search and seizure warrants. the federal government is responsible for properly maintaining the chain of custody for any seized items. ci agents must be able to prove it is the same item that was seized and that the item is in the same condition as when it was seized in order for that seized item to be admissible as evidence. grand jury-related evidence must be kept separate from other non-grand jury evidence. despite these clear directives, the ci has routinely ignored protocol, violating the rights of the taxpayers they are supposed to protect. 7. irs has conducted many armed raids on innocent americans in the late 1990s, the irs came under scrutiny for the harsh tactics it used to enforce the tax code. with tens of billion in new funding, it is not hard to see how these abuses could return. a 1998 article by washington post noted many small business owners were harassed by the irs, only for the agency to find no evidence of wrongdoing. ``an oklahoma tax-return preparer, a texas oilman and a virginia restaurateur told lawmakers how raiding parties of armed agents from the irs criminal investigation division barged into their homes or offices, frightened their employees and families--and ultimately came up empty- handed.'' ``two of the men said they later found that former employees had precipitated the raids, and that the irs had done little or no checking on their informants' credibility. the third witness said he never could determine why he was targeted.'' one man described over a dozen armed irs officials raiding his offices, seizing business documents, and harassing clients and employees: ``richard gardner, whose company prepares 4,500 to 6,000 tax returns each year, said that one morning in 1995, he was called out of a meeting. he found 15 irs agents and a half- dozen u.s. marshals in his lobby, ``all armed and wearing those jackets that say in bright letters irs' or u.s. marshal' on the back.'' ``they seized his client records, computers, personal papers and other files, he said, and held them for two years while the irs investigation continued. gardner was able to buy new computers and continue in business, but the damage to his business was extensive. he said irs agents went to clients and demanded they wear hidden microphones when meeting with gardner; they hauled his wife before a grand jury; and his employees were told they would be able to buy his business cheaply because he would be out of business soon.'' these were not isolated cases. a 1998 article by the new york times described ``military style raids'' by irs agents against taxpayers who were accused of nonviolent behavior the senate finance committee held a series of irs oversight hearings in 1998. among many witnesses to abuses carried out by armed irs agents, a virginia restaurant owner testified the following on april 29, 1998: ``armed agents, accompanied by drug-sniffing dogs, stormed my restaurants during breakfast, ordered patrons out of the restaurant, and began interrogating my employees. the irs impounded my records, my cash registers, and my computers.'' [[page h7668]] ``when the raid occurred at my home, the front door was torn from the hinges, my dogs were impounded, along with my safe and 12 years of my personal income tax returns and supporting documents.'' giving more money, power and guns to an agency with a terrible firearms safety record and a terrible due process record is alarming to law-abiding americans. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. smucker). mr. smucker. madam speaker, there are so many things wrong with the policies in this bill. it will certainly punish americans' pocketbooks through record-high inflation, new taxes, and an army of irs agents. it can get even worse. this drug price setting regime in the bill, which i want to speak about briefly, may very well put american lives at risk. the cbo agreed. fewer drugs will be developed as a result of the policies in this bill. according to a study from the university of chicago, government price controls in the bill will block 342 new cures from reaching market over the coming decades. that means that our constituents and family members who are battling diseases like cancer or alzheimer's may well be left with no hope of finding a cure. the university estimates that blocking these cures will collectively take 330 million years off of americans' lives. that is 1 year per american, which, by the way, is a toll 31 times worse than the covid-19 pandemic. american innovation and ingenuity got this country out of the covid- 19 pandemic. this bill abandons free enterprise in favor of socialism and will cost the taxpayer too many dollars and cancer patients too many years. mr. neal. madam speaker, a reminder that there are, i believe, almost 600,425 medicare beneficiaries who have diabetes in pennsylvania. it is important that the bill that we have caps insulin costs. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from alabama (ms. sewell), a terrific member of the committee. ms. sewell. madam speaker, i rise today in strong support of the inflation reduction act. this transformational legislation will lower healthcare costs for millions of americans and thousands of alabamians by extending aca tax credits for an additional 3 years and reducing the prescription drug costs for our seniors by allowing hhs, for the first time, to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and capping out-of-pocket drug costs to $2,000 per year. this is a big deal for american families and especially the families that i represent in alabama. this bill is also the single largest climate investment in america's history. this bill includes my carbon capture and sequestration expansion act that will extend the 45 credit eligibilities for carbon capture projects to 2023. when i think about all the great things that are in this particular bill, it is truly transformational for the people that i represent and for the american people. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. let us put people first over politics. mr. brady. madam speaker, i include in the record the following joint committee on taxation analysis that shows that american manufacturers are hardest hit by the democrats' made in america tax--$200 billion-- and they will pay over half of that tax. congress of the united states, joint committee on taxation, washington, dc, august 11, 2022. memorandum to: redacted from: thomas a. barthold subject: revenue estimate this memorandum is in response to your request for an estimate of how the burden of the corporate minimum financial statement income tax as contained in section 10101 of an amendment in the nature of a substitute to h.r. 5376. ``an act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title ii of s. con. res. 14'' as passed by the senate on august 7, 2022, would fall across different industrial sectors. business income tax returns ask taxpayers to report the industry in which they are primarily engaged, identifying the industry by the code numbers established under the north american industrial classification system (``naics code''). this is self-reported and the internal revenue service does not verify the accuracy of the classification stated by the taxpayer. the naics code system allows data to be aggregated at different levels of general categorization. two-digit codes are the broadest categorization. for example, code 31 encompasses all manufacturing. as we project that only approximately 150 taxpayers annually will be subject to the proposed book minimum tax, in the accompanying table we generally report results by two-digit reporting to protect the privacy of the tax return data on which we base our analysis. we estimate the corporate minimum financial statement income tax as contained in the amendment in the nature of a substitute to h.r. 5376 as passed by the senate would have the following effect on federal fiscal year budget receipts. fiscal years

mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. murphy). mr. murphy of north carolina. madam speaker, i rise in opposition to this reckless bill today. i want to speak specifically to one issue, and that is medicine. as a practicing physician, i have seen miraculous curative advancements made in medicine over the last 15 years. this partisan package will destroy medical innovation and cripple independent private physicians. up to 342 new lifesaving drugs will be prevented by this bill. we all agree that the cost of medicine is way too high in this country, but instead of attacking the real causes, we are now going to be shifting medicare dollars away from doctors, those who actually take care of patients, and give them to insurance companies and green new deal policies. some physicians will see, on average, a 40 percent reduction in reimbursement. given the constant threats of medicare cuts for physicians, who the hell would want to practice medicine or could afford to practice medicine in this country anymore? this scheme will have long-lasting negative impacts on patients, physicians, and the solvency of medicare, and it will set a dangerous precedent for future medicine to use medicare as a piggy bank to subsidize unrelated policies. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill. [[page h7669]] mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from washington (ms. delbene), who is well known for her work in the renewable energy field. ms. delbene. madam speaker, congresswoman jackie walorski was a friend, and i send my deepest condolences to her family and the families of zackery potts and emma thomson. madam speaker, the inflation reduction act is nothing less than historic and shows our constituents that governance can still work for them. the bill extends the affordable care act insurance subsidies that have saved 13 million americans an average of $800 a year on health coverage. it will enable the u.s. to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030 through investments like my clean hydrogen provision and make it more affordable for families to purchase energy and cost-saving products like electric vehicles and solar panels. these are provisions that the new democrat coalition and i have been calling for from the beginning. for our seniors, the bill will lower the costs of prescription drugs by allowing medicare to negotiate lower prices and will cap out-of-pocket drug spending at $2,000 annually. these are tangible benefits for americans. the legislation is fully paid for by ensuring corporations pay their fair share and providing the irs with the resources it needs after decades of republican-driven budget cuts. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this bill. i remind my colleagues that there are 533,775 medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in north carolina, but the gentleman remains against this bill capping insulin costs and medicare at $35 per month. mr. brady. madam speaker, i include in the record the following letter of opposition, which represents america's independent natural gas and oil production industry, which says this bill will only exacerbate--make worse--our nation's energy crisis. august 11, 2022. hon. nancy pelosi, speaker, house of representatives, washington, dc. hon. kevin mccarthy, republican leader, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear speaker pelosi and leader mccarthy: the undersigned trade associations, representing thousands of businesses across the united states that collectively employ millions of americans, write to express our opposition to the inflation reduction act (ira) as passed by the u.s. senate. further, we write to urge you to reconsider policies within the legislation before proceeding. the united states has experienced its second consecutive quarter of negative gdp growth, and american consumers are facing record high inflation. we share the goal of addressing climate change, as evidenced in the policies we support and in the actions that we take every day. however, the considerable tax increases and new government spending in the ira amount to the wrong policies at the wrong time. we are also facing the most significant global energy crisis since the 1970's, and u.s. energy security--and that of our strategic allies abroad--is being put to the test. further, u.s. energy costs have increased 40 percent over the past twelve months, creating a serious strain on american household incomes. with these current conditions as the backdrop for this legislation, there are several specific policies included in the ira which are particularly troubling and deserve re- consideration. we would like to draw your attention to three such provisions: 1. the ira imposes a new corporate minimum tax, increasing taxes on americans by more than $300 billion over the next 10 years. as president obama noted in 2009, ``the last thing you want to do is raise taxes in the middle of a recession.'' 2. the ira imposes an $11.7 billion tax on crude oil and petroleum products. at a time of record-high energy prices, congress should not add additional costs on american energy companies competing globally. 3. the ira imposes additional constraints on the ability of companies to develop and produce the energy that americans need to fuel our economy and strengthen our energy security. this includes increased fees on domestic production and the establishment of a new $6.3 billion natural gas tax. finally, the ira fails to address permitting reform, which is desperately needed and is essential to effectively deliver affordable, reliable energy to consumers in a growing economy. to date, neither the house nor the senate have introduced comprehensive permitting reform legislation. we urge congress to quickly consider and pass permitting reform without delay. for the above-stated reasons, we express our opposition to the ira and request that you reconsider passage of this legislation. sincerely, american petroleum institute;

[from penn wharton] senate-passed inflation reduction act: estimates of budgetary and macroeconomic effects key points pwbm estimates that the senate-passed inflation reduction act, as written, would reduce cumulative deficits by $264 billion over the 10-year budget window. the act would have no meaningful effect on inflation in the near term but would reduce inflation by around 0.1 percentage points by the middle of the first decade. these point estimates, however, are not statistically different from zero, indicating a low level of confidence that the legislation would have any measurable impact on inflation. relative to current law, the act would slightly reduce gdp in the first decade while slightly increasing gdp by 2050. these estimates include the impact of debt reduction, carbon reduction, and tax incentives on investments and working hours. most, but not all, of the tax increases fall on higher income households. however, future generations, including higher-income households, gain from the improved economy, including a reduction in carbon emissions. introduction on sunday august 7th, the u.s. senate passed the inflation reduction act of 2022 under fy2022 budget reconciliation instructions. pwbm recently analyzed a previous version of the bill. we also compared our analysis against that of the joint tax committee and congressional budget office who use an older economics baseline from july 2021. in this brief, pwbm analyzes the budgetary, macroeconomic, and distributional effects of the final senate passed version. in line with the previously released version of the bill, the act provides for new spending and tax incentives related to the adoption of clean energy technology, both at the industrial and consumer level. it extends a temporary expansion of affordable care act (aca) health insurance subsidies for an additional two years. to offset these deficit-increasing initiatives, the bill imposes new taxes on certain businesses, reduces government outlays on prescription drugs through pricing reforms. it also provides for new irs funding which pwbm estimates would increase revenue collections above new outlays. provision descriptions and estimated budgetary effects the final version of the act makes several key amendments to the version we previously analyzed. first, the new corporate minimum tax no longer restricts the tax benefit of accelerated depreciation, and private equity firms are exempted from the tax. second, the carried interest provision was removed. third, new revenue raising provisions (a tax on stock buybacks and a restriction on pass-through loss deductions) were added. fourth, due to senate rules, drug price inflation caps for private insurance plans were removed. more specifically, the act proposes the following policy changes: extension of expanded aca subsidies. extends the temporary expansion of premium tax credits through 2025. the expansion, which offers eligibility to households above 400 percent of the poverty line, is scheduled to expire at the end of 2022 under current law. climate and energy provisions. includes tax rebates and credits to lower energy costs for households; tax credits, research, loans, and grants to increase domestic manufacturing capacity for wind turbines, solar panels, batteries, and other essential components of clean energy production and storage; tax credits to reduce carbon emissions; programs to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture; a new fee on methane emissions; and more. minimum tax on corporations' book income. creates a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax based on the financial statement income of corporations with at least $1 billion in such income. allows for bonus and accelerated depreciation deductions when calculating taxable book income. tax on share repurchases. imposes a new 1 percent tax on corporations' net repurchase of stock. extension of excess noncorporate losses limitation. extends the limitation on the deduction of pass-through losses through tax year 2028, which under current law is scheduled to expire at the end of 2026. the maximum deductible loss, which is indexed to inflation, is $540,000 for married taxpayers in 2022. prescription drug price reforms. allows medicare to negotiate the price of certain prescription drugs; limits the price growth of certain drugs paid covered under medicare to inflation; repeals the implementation of a ``rebate rule'' scheduled to increase drug-related medicare outlays beginning in 2027; redesigns medicare part d benefit formula and caps out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries. irs funding. appropriates approximately $80 billion over the next decade for irs enforcement activities including the hiring and training of new auditors, it systems modernization, and taxpayer services. table 1 presents pwbm's estimate of conventional budgetary effects over the 10-year budget window defined in the fy2022 reconciliation instructions. we estimate the act would reduce cumulative noninterest deficits by $264 billion from fy2022 through fy2031. estimated effects on inflation we estimate that the inflation reduction act as passed by the senate would have a very modest impact on inflation over the next decade. the act produces some upward pressure on prices in 2023 and 2024, but its effects are too small to meaningfully affect measured the personal consumption expenditures (pce) inflation rate as reported by the bureau of economic analysis. the act would reduce annual inflation by around 0.1 percentage points in about five years, once major deficit-reducing provisions of the legislation are fully implemented, but the act would have no measurable impact on inflation after 2028. all these point estimates are not statistically different from zero, indicating a low level of confidence that the legislation would have a measurable impact on inflation. other macroeconomic effects government spending rises because of the climate-related spending and the extension of the aca subsidies are greater than the savings from prescription drug pricing reforms. however, additional tax revenues are greater than the spending increases, which leads to a decrease in government debt. government debt goes down by 4.1 percent in 2040 and 8 percent in 2050, which crowds-in investment in productive private capital. the provisions which increase taxes on business activity lower the after-tax return to investment, which offsets the positive effects on investment from lower government debt. net of these two effects, private productive capital declines by 0.2 percent in 2031, is unchanged in 2040 and increases by 0.3 percent in 2050. the drop in productive capital in 2031 leads to a 0.1 percent decline in gdp. nonetheless, as government debt declines, private capital increases by 0.3 percent by 2050, and workers become more productive. higher worker productivity is reflected in wages that increase by 0.1 percent in the same year. moreover, the increase in private capital combined with the accumulated productivity increases from the climate and energy effects, described in a previous brief, leads to an increase in gdp, which grows 0.1 percent in 2050. distributional tax effects: conventional estimates the inflation reduction act contains a wide array of subsidies, taxes, and pricing reforms, each with varying impacts on households and businesses. for example, some large businesses would face higher tax bills; individuals buying certain health insurance plans would face lower out-of-pocket costs; some households who evade taxes would be made to pay; and pharmaceutical companies would earn lower revenues. though not responsible for remitting taxes assessed on business activity, households bear some of the economic burden of such taxes. shareholders receive lower after-tax returns, and workers earn lower wages with fewer productivity-enhancing investments. distributional analysis traditionally focuses on the effects of revenue-raising tax provisions since attempting to allocate all spending--including for roads, education, national defense, some transfer programs, and the bill inherited by future payers for current deficits--is challenging and subjective. put differently, distributional analysis typically is not intended to be a holistic incidence. instead, distributional analysis attempts to estimate answers the narrower question: for a given set of spending benefits [[page h7671]] and change in debt, who finances the costs under the explicitly stated revenue provisions in the bill? in the case of this act, the revenue is raised from the corporate minimum tax as well as the tax on share repurchases. conventional distributional analysis measures the long-run incidence of tax increases imposed at a single point in time. pwbm assumes that 75 percent of corporate income taxes are borne by owners of capital with the remainder borne by labor--magnitudes consistent with empirical research and scorekeeping convention. we apply this incidence assumption when analyzing the corporate minimum tax provision. however, for the stock buyback tax, we assume that shareholders bear 100 percent of the burden because it is assessed on a discretionary balance sheet transaction rather than on income from economic production. we find that all income groups would bear some of the additional burden of the 2023 revenue-raising business tax changes. average burden ranges from $5 for the lowest quintile, to $55 for the middle quintile, to $61,520 for the top 0.1 percent of tax units. at lower incomes, the tax incidence largely reflects lower wages over time relative to baseline, whereas at high income the tax incidence mostly reflects more immediate changes in the value of financial assets. distributional effects: dynamic estimates pwbm's dynamic distribution metric shows how benefits and costs accrue across generations when accounting for macroeconomic effects, including the increase in productivity from lowering carbon emissions relative to baseline. while this analysis is less granular than conventional distributional analysis, the dynamic ``equivalent variation'' measure captures important dynamics like lifetime income trajectories, the ``insurance value'' of means-tested benefits and changes in wages and returns to capital investments. table 4 reports the equivalent variation for households at different ages (relative to the year 2022) and incomes. each value shown in table 1 corresponds to the one-time benefit that the corresponding household receives from the legislation. for example, the value of -$700 for a household age 40 in the bottom income quintile indicates that this household is worse off by $700 under this legislation, including at age 40 and the remainder of his or her lifetime. put differently, this household is indifferent between the adoption of the inflation reduction act and making a one-time payment of $700 that avoids the adoption of the act. however, a household in the bottom quintile who is born in 20 years (-20 age in 2022) would be $1,900 better off. notice two main effects that vary by both income and generation: first, current workers and retirees prefer current law over the provisions in the inflation reduction act. people alive today bear the burden of business tax increases in the form of lower investment returns and lower wages in the near term. however, future generations gain from the adoption of the act, including positive gains to capital formation from reducing the debt as well as the increase in total factor productivity from reducing carbon emissions relative to baseline. second, current higher-income households bear a substantially larger share of the tax burden while future higher-income households also gain the most from the improved economy. in the long run, the inflation reduction act leads to lower government debt, higher wages, higher total factor productivity and higher gdp. although older workers and retirees prefer current law, this growth leads to significant gains for younger households in all income brackets. as lower government debt crowds in additional productive private capital, wages increase. in addition, these younger workers begin to benefit from the accumulating productivity benefits from climate investments. therefore, workers in the future will receive higher wages and income, which is reflected in larger equivalent variations for younger cohorts of workers. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from tennessee (mr. rose). mr. rose. madam speaker, tennesseans are hurting from the skyrocketing cost of living everywhere they turn. now, it seems as if the united states has entered into a spending-induced recession caused by the irresponsible fiscal policies of president biden and congressional democrats. instead of focusing on passing meaningful and impactful legislation to help lower the cost of living, we are voting on a bill that spends hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars. the bill will do nothing to help ease the pain my neighbors in tennessee are experiencing and, in fact, is likely to increase inflation even more and push prices on everything even higher. it gives a tax break to wealthy americans who can already afford to purchase expensive electric cars. it also increases taxes amidst a recession, which will only make it worse, and it allows the irs to hire an army of 87,000 new federal agents to go after the middle class. madam speaker, i will be voting ``no,'' and i urge my colleagues to do so as well. {time} 1400 mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from south carolina (mr. clyburn), the majority whip of the democratic caucus, whose district i have visited. mr. clyburn. madam speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding the time. madam speaker, i rise today in full support of the inflation reduction act. there are few days during a congressional career that feel truly historic. for me this is one of them. we have passed other historic legislation to help our economy overcome the pandemic, create jobs, repair and invest in our infrastructure, and bolster critical supply chains. passage of the inflation reduction act, however, will lead to the transformative change democrats in congress have been working with president biden to achieve for the past year and a half. the inflation reduction act will check inflation by reducing the deficit by $300 billion over the next decade. it achieves that by ensuring tax fairness that requires corporations to pay a minimum tax of 15 percent and protecting families making less than $400,000 a year from paying even one penny more in taxes. in addition, the inflation reduction act will assist families by extending subsidies for the purchase of health insurance through the affordable care act. seniors on medicare will benefit from the government's ability to negotiate prescription drug prices and by capping out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 per year. having experienced my late wife's 30-year battle with diabetes, i am especially pleased this bill would cap insulin costs at $35 per month for those on medicare. this is a giant step forward, but we will continue working to overcome the republican opposition that blocks extending the same lifesaving measures to those on private insurance. finally, this bill will cut climate pollution by 40 percent by 2030. it does so by building a new, clean energy economy that invests in a healthy future for all our citizens, creating more than 9 million new jobs. this legislation creates a nuclear production tax credit for existing reactors, ensuring that my home state of south carolina continues to be a leader in clean energy generation while also making electricity affordable and accessible. it also puts $60 billion toward environmental justice to help communities, especially communities of color, address the legacy of pollution in their neighborhoods. i believe today we are demonstrating what we democrats mean when we say we are putting people over politics, while our republican colleagues continue to put their politics over the people's health and well-being. madam speaker, i am proud to stand with the people of america and help with this bill. mr. brady. madam speaker, i would note that every democrat in congress, in the house and senate, strongly opposed providing prescription drugs for seniors in medicare part d, and then-leader pelosi at the time said, it would end medicare as we know it to help seniors with these lifesaving medicines. madam speaker, i include in the record the following study from the university of chicago which shows the democrats' drug pricing scheme and controls could kill up to 342 cures, many of them lifesaving cures, in the next two decades alone. [from university of chicago, sept. 2021] the evidence base on the impact of price controls on medical innovation (by tomas j. philipson and troy durie) executive summary this issue brief reviews the evidence on the impact of price controls on biopharmaceutical innovation and calibrates what this evidence implies for recent price control proposals in the us. a large academic literature estimates the effect of future drug revenues on r&d spending with a mid-range effect of a 1 percent reduction in revenue leading to a 1.5 percent reduction in r&d activity. using the range of such effects found in the literature we find the proposed price controls of us bill hr3, the lower drug costs now act, would lead to a 29 to 60 percent reduction in r&d from 2021 to 2039 which translates into 167 to 342 fewer new drug approvals [[page h7672]] during that period. the mid-range effect of the evidence implies a 44.6 percent decline in r&d and 254 fewer new drug approvals. as a benchmark on the large size of the adverse health effects this implies, we conservatively find the loss in life from the price controls the next 10 years is 20 times larger than the loss from covid-19 to date in the us. we argue this is a conservatively low estimate of the impact of such proposals even though it is as much as a ten times larger reduction in new drugs compared to a recent cbo analysis. section 1: introduction a national debate has emerged again about the effect of price controls on pharmaceutical innovation. many proponents of price controls for pharmaceutical drugs argue that they do not impact innovation while opponents argue they will lead to fewer new drugs. this issue brief attempts to provide insight into the likely effects of recent price control proposals by analyzing how the debate can be informed by basic economics and the prevailing empirical evidence. while the united states has less stringent price regulations when compared to other nations, the biden administration has recently announced plans to lower drug prices through policies similar to those outlined in a recent bill referred to as the lower drug costs now act (h.r. 3) that passed the house of representatives in december 2019 and was reintroduced in april 2021. this proposal would create price controls for the government's highest expenditure drugs and then apply price controls to firms conducting private sector transactions. this issue brief reviews the evidence on how sensitive innovation is to changes in revenues and applies the evidence to estimate the effect of proposed price controls. section 2: evidence base on revenue effects on innovation biopharmaceutical companies routinely project future market size and profits for their products to determine the rate of return on investment (roi) from r&d. a large body of evidence suggests that these market practices translate into a predictable positive relationship between realized revenues and r&d spending in the economy in general and for biomedical innovation in particular. a rich academic literature quantifies this relationship between future revenues and pharmaceutical innovation. for assessing evidence related to revenue effects on r&d, it is important to recognize that global profits drive innovation and that revenues from different countries have different effects on those global profits because of different profit margins across countries. expected earnings, not revenues, drive r&d investments. therefore, decreases in us revenue will have larger effects on global profits than revenue losses in price controlled markets in europe due to higher profit margins in the us. goldman and lakdawalla (2018) find that pharmaceutical profits in the united states accounts for 64 to 78 percent of global profits, similar to an estimate from the council of economic advisers (cea) (2018). consequently, the evidence finds that studies focusing on us revenue losses show larger r&d effects than those studying revenue losses in europe. in particular, a set of papers looks at the expansion of the medicare prescription drug benefit, medicare part d, which provides the most relevant evidence for assessing the revenue effects of medicare policy changes. they find that companies recognized this expansion and increased innovation in drugs treating diseases prevalent in the elderly population more so than innovation in non-elderly diseases (blume-kohout and sood 2013). quantifying that relationship, a 1 percent increase in market size due to medicare part d leads to a 2.8 percent increase in new drug approvals. another often cited paper finds a 1 percent increase in potential market size leads to a 4-6 percent increase in the entry of new drugs (acemoglu and linn 2004) in the us. though other studies have found lower effects in europe of the relationship between potential market size and the number of new treatments, a clear strong positive relationship exists (dubois et al. 2015). other studies show that a 1 percent increase in price leads to a 0.22-1.33 percent increase in innovation. another extensive literature illustrates how companies change their investments in lower quality drugs due to price controls and other regulations that decrease how much can be charged for high-quality drugs. we synthesized the evidence base by computing the average r&d elasticity with respect to revenue estimated from 10 different studies looking at the effect of a price change, expected market, and overall revenue on r&d. table 1 illustrates the elasticities used from each paper, and the average elasticity across these 10 studies is 1.54. note: acemoglu and linn (2004) find an elasticity range of 4-6 based on if all approved including generics are included or not. we take the midpoint of this range. abbott and vernon (2005) find a price cut of 40 to 50 percent lowers r&d by 30 to 60 percent. taking the midpoint of these numbers gives a 45 percent price cut leads to a 45 percent decrease in r&d, or an elasticity of 1. to assess the impact on the number of new drugs from reductions in r&d spending, a common approach is to divide the reduction in r&d spending by an estimate of the costs of bringing a drug to market. this is a useful approach and implies a proportional reduction in new drugs to the reduction in r&d spending regardless of the particular cost per drug. in other words, using this methodology, a 10 percent reduction in r&d spending leads to 10 percent fewer drugs regardless of the cost per drug estimate used. the elasticity of r&d spending with respect to revenue in this case therefore also represents the elasticity of new drugs to revenue. despite the evidence, there is some debate among law makers concerning whether revenue or price controls affect innovation at all. however, the evidence is consistent with common market practices of biopharmaceutical innovation--a positive relationship between investment and earnings. such market practices include the use of net present value (npv) calculations to determine a new drug's roi. biopharmaceutical companies determine the demand for new drug therapies by analyzing the prevalence of disease, insurance coverage of the population affected by the disease, and reimbursement by payers managing patients' care. the pharmaceutical industry spent more than $91 billion on r&d in 2020. in obtaining such r&d funding, companies have relied on venture capital funding, licensing agreements, or mergers and acquisitions as well as their own revenue. all rely on roi assessments to evaluate r&d investments. indeed, markets routinely assess the enterprise value of firms by estimating the present value of expected cash flows across all business lines and projects. section 3: calibration of the impact on innovation of proposed us price controls this section evaluates what the evidence implies for the innovation effects of proposed us price controls. we calibrate that the price controls implemented in the united states would lead to a 29.2 to 60.0 percent reduction in r&d from 2021 to 2039. this equates to $952.2 billion to $2.0 trillion in lost r&d spending and 167 to 342 fewer new drug approvals during this period. this means annual new drug approvals will be 11.7 to 24.0 percent lower per year from 2021 to 2029 and 45.0 to 92.4 percent lower from 2030 to 2039. we discuss how these findings, as well as findings from other studies, differ from cbo (2019), which finds only 37 fewer new drug approvals over this time period, which is 550.2 to 1,024 percent lower than our estimates. our estimates are conservative as the entire evidence base is considered and not only the evidence base for the more r&d sensitive us market. it should be noted, however, that making comparisons to cbo estimates is made more difficult due to the highly non- transparent discussion of their underlying analysis, which makes third-party replication of their results impossible. this ``black-box'' nature of analysis is often the case with government reports and raises larger issues with the difficulty for private parties and taxpayers--who funded the analysis--being able to assess their accuracy. in contrast, we believe the presentation of the evidence discussed above, and the innovation effects they directly imply, is highly transparent as it simply documents the findings of the studies and their implied effects. 3.1 the proposed us price controls the united states has fewer restrictions on price than other countries, but the biden administration has announced their goal to lower drug prices through greater price regulation, as set forth in a recent bill referred to as h.r. 3. this proposal would change the way certain single-source brand drugs are priced for medicare beneficiaries by requiring drug manufacturers to ``negotiate'' drug prices with the secretary of health and human services. a prohibitive excise tax of 65 to 95 percent will be applied to a company's annual gross sales if they refuse to negotiate, making the requirement largely equivalent to mandatory price controls. drug prices set by the secretary may not exceed the prices in specified countries by more than 20 percent and price increases would be capped at the rate of inflation (cbo 2021). in addition, these price controls would also be extended to private transactions by employer-based plans as stated on august 12, 2021 by president biden and as implied by the proposed legislation. private payers can choose the lower prices negotiated by the government, which they presumably will. 3.2 cbo's estimated effects and alternative estimated effects of the proposed price controls cbo (2019) previously estimated that a drop in future revenues due to h.r. 3 would lead to 8 fewer drugs from 2020 to 2029, which would then expand to 30 fewer drugs from 2030 to 2039). in august 2021, cbo (2021b) updated its estimated impact of price negotiations to be 2 fewer drugs in the first decade (0.5 percent), 23 fewer in the second decade (5 percent), and 34 fewer drugs in the third decade (8 percent). since the development process takes about a decade, the long run effects of the bill will be larger than its short-run effects. to align these estimates with our time period of 2021-2039, we lower their estimate to 7 fewer drugs from 2021 to 2029 and keep the estimate of 30 fewer drugs from 2030 to 2039. consistent with our analysis, other analysts' assessments of cbo's 2019 analysis of h.r. 3 conclude that cbo (2019) likely underestimates the impact of h.r. 3. charles river associates (2021) finds the cbo study underestimates the company revenue impact by assuming companies will be able to set their price at the high end of the allowed price [[page h7673]] range, and that companies will be able to increase their non- u.s. price. both assumptions may not be true due to uncertainty around behavioral responses in negotiations. further, for the loss-of-revenue impact on r&d, cbo extrapolates price control effects from smaller markets, and they do not account for the larger impact on targeted disease groups most impacted by the policy like rare diseases and oncology. cbo's analysis relies on dubois et al. (2015) to estimate the effect of h.r. 3 on r&d, but cra notes that this estimated effect is smaller than most of the other literature, too dependent on specific assumptions, and may not be as relevant to a policy of h.r. 3's magnitude. other analysts' estimates of the impact of the price controls introduced in h.r. 3 show a considerably larger impact on global revenues and r&d than assumed by cbo. stengel et al. (2020) estimate drug manufacturer revenues would fall 34 to 44 percent, which would equate to about $1.3 to $1.7 trillion in total lost global revenues from 2020- 2029. vital transformation (2021) estimates annual earnings would fall 56 percent, or on average $102 billion a year, starting in the year 2024. this fall in earnings when fitted to past data would have lowered new approved drug therapies in their sample from 68 new drugs to 7 new drugs, an 89.7 percent decline from 2010 to 2019. 3.3 effects of the proposed price controls implied by the evidence base in light of the reported shortcomings in the cbo (2019) report, we used the broader evidence base discussed in this issue brief to assess the effect h.r. 3's proposed price controls would have on innovation. we create a range of the estimated drop in global drug manufacturer revenues by taking the cbo's lower estimate of 19 percent and the midpoint revenue effect of alternative studies, 39 percent, from stengel et al. (2020). as discussed earlier, a conservatively low estimate of the elasticity of revenue on either r&d or the introduction of new drugs is 1.5 based on current evidence. we apply this elasticity to the 19 to 39 percent decline in revenues to derive a percentage reduction in r&d. this percentage reduction is thereafter used to calibrate the reduction in absolute r&d spending or number of approved drugs which is applied to the cbo baseline trend in absolute values. in other words, the reduction in r&d spending and the number of new drug approvals during 2021 to 2039 is obtained by determining how much would be lost in each of those measures with the number of approved drugs being compared to cbos baseline trends given the percent reduction in r&d. we create our own trend for r&d spending by taking a time series from phrma's 2021 membership survey showing pharmaceutical r&d spending from 2000-2019 and calculated the compound annual growth rate to get a trend for expected r&d spending through 2039. we then applied the impact on r&d to each year and summed these values to get a total. for new drug approvals, we use the 30 new drug approvals baseline from cbo (2019) and applied the impact on r&d for each year and summed. table 2 illustrates our main findings. using the average elasticity on the 19 to 39 percent drop in global revenues, innovation through r&d is expected to drop 29 to 60 percent. using the middle of our range, this would equate to lost r&d spending of up to $1.5 trillion. we find that this drop in spending will lead to 167 to 342 fewer new drug approvals. our estimates are therefore 550.2 percent to 1024.0 percent larger than cbo (2019)'s estimated 37 fewer new drug approvals, adjusted to our time period. cbo (2019) points out that lower r&d spending will take time to be reflected in new drug approvals due to the long development process, so the reduction in revenue results in 7 fewer new drug approval, 18.9 percent of their total estimate, in the first 9 years and 30 more in the following decade, 81.l percent of their total estimate. we assume this breakdown as well, so new drug approvals will fall by 32 to 65 approvals from 2021 to 2029 and 135 to 277 approvals from 2030 to 2039. these significant drops in new drug approvals will lead to delays in needed drug therapies, resulting in worse health outcomes for patients. the failure to discover and get new drug approvals leads to worse health outcomes. cea (2019) did an early analysis of h.r. 3 finding 375 million to 100 million life years lost due to this policy's impact on r&d spending through 2029. for comparison, using death data through september 22, 2021, sars-cov-2 has directly reduced health outcomes by 7.5 million life years. the 7.5 million life years lost is only just over 10 percent as large as the midpoint of cea (2019)'s estimate due to h.r. 3. we calculate this loss in life years by applying life expectancy estimates conditional on age from cdc to the age distribution of deaths from sars-cov-2 from cdc updated through september 22, 2021. then we multiply the life expectancy at each age grouping by the number of deaths and sum to get 7.5 million life years lost. a prior study shows how every $2,000 spent on pharmaceutical research and development increases population health by one statistical life-year (lichtenberg 2002). when applied to our r&d spending estimates, this would lead to 159.3 million to 326.9 million life years lost by 2029 which increases to 476.1 million to 977.2 million by 2039. this amounts to the direct negative health effects of sars-cov-2 to be only 3.1 percent as large as our midpoint estimate by 2029 and 1.0 percent as large by 2039. price controls have significant health costs to the u.s. population. our analysis likely underestimates true innovation effects, which, if considered fully could make our findings even further away from the cbo estimates. this is because the average r&d elasticity of 1.5 used included studies of non- u.s. markets with lower earnings effects than u.s. markets. given that the u.s. has higher margins, price controls are expected to have a larger impact on earnings. thus, only using the larger estimated elasticities from u.s. markets, which would double the elasticity of 1.5, would yield proportionally larger differences between the evidence base and the cbo estimates. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from florida (mr. rutherford). mr. rutherford. madam speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. madam speaker, i rise today in strong opposition to this reckless spending bill, which, contrary to its name, will do absolutely nothing to address inflation. in fact, the bill before us today will further threaten the prosperity of hardworking, middle-class taxpayers. the same leaders who drove this economy into a recession are back. but this time, it is another failed plan to raise taxes, build more bureaucracy, and create a government slush fund with taxpayer dollars. we need to call this bill what it is. it is a $700-billion debacle that will drive up costs for everyone, double the size of the irs, attack medical innovation, as you have already heard, and use $350 billion to implement the green new deal all while giving handouts to the wealthy. hardworking americans across the country are facing the reality of rising prices and a nationwide recession. they deserve leaders who are focusing on the lives of everyday americans, not politicians who pander to the president and his failed policies. madam speaker, i urge a ``no'' vote on this egregious bill. mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. brendan f. boyle). mr. brendan f. boyle of pennsylvania. madam speaker, the word ``historic'' is probably overused at times. really, it is a day like today when the word ``historic'' is warranted. for decades, politicians of both parties talked about giving medicare the ability to negotiate prescription drugs to bring down the costs for seniors. today, in this bill, we are doing it. for decades, politicians talked about capping the amount of money seniors paid every year on prescription drugs. some in my district in philadelphia pay $5,000 a year, $10,000 a year. this bill caps it at no more than $2,000 a year. again, for decades, politicians talked about the need to address climate change and to make a large investment, so that we can finally tackle this existential challenge for america and for the world. here in this bill we are doing it: the largest single investment to address climate change in our nation's history. i know that on social media and on tv, it tends to be the performative politics that get most of the attention, that helps breed cynicism within our constituents. it is legislation like this that makes a difference in people's lives. this is why we are here as lawmakers: to do the people's business. mr. brady. madam speaker, i insert in the record the following analysis which shows the top 10 manufacturing industries hit hardest by the democrats' made-in-america manufacturing

h7674]] mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ohio (mr. davidson). mr. davidson. madam speaker, this bill will not reduce inflation. it will pull us deeper into the current recession and take america further in the wrong direction. it is simply more government and less freedom. in the past year, inflation has exceeded 13 percent, and real wages have effectively fallen by 4.5 percent. the federal reserve and big government combined to fuel inflation, and now people are being crushed by these high prices. you cannot spend your way out of inflation. but that is exactly what this bill tries to do with $745 billion in new spending. it raises taxes in a recession. and it gives more than six times the agency's current annual budget for the irs. it is going to more than double audits on families. instead of addressing the 32 percent increase in energy prices by increasing domestic production, this bill spends billions on green new deal pet projects like a $27 billion epa-run climate bank and a $250- billion federally run department of energy loan program. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues, please oppose this bill. mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. beyer), who has had a profound influence on this legislation and knows it inside and out. mr. beyer. madam speaker, today we protect the world for future generations. madam speaker, the inflation reduction act will do untold good for the nation and for the american people. this is our generation's signature contribution to american history, our social security act, or civil rights act, or even the bill of rights. the act will lower healthcare costs, reduce prescription drug prices, and create jobs. we have emphatically put people over politics. much like a proposal i introduced with senators elizabeth warren and angus king, it will actually reduce the deficit by preventing tax avoidance for the biggest corporations in this country, requiring them to shoulder their fair burden of the tax responsibility. most importantly, congress is finally taking the sweeping, ambitious action we desperately need to prevent the worst effects of the climate crisis. we are passing the most important environmental bill in history. i am privileged to serve on chairman neal's brilliant and enlightened ways and means committee. i am proud of the diverse tax credit provisions i partnered with my distinguished members and friends. these are the parts of the act which will have enormous climate consequences: they will accelerate the adoption of zero emission mid-size trucks, vans, and other commercial vehicles. they will scale up direct air capture technology to remove carbon pollution directly from the atmosphere. they will incentivize the reduction of emissions from commercial buildings. these provisions and the bill as a whole will create huge numbers of good-paying jobs. then there is the big picture. this bill will put us on a path to reduce our target emissions and actually help save the planet. madam speaker, i thank my colleagues for their support. mr. brady. madam speaker, i include in the record the following editorial from the wall street journal, which shows this bill will only reduce global temperatures by, at best, 0.028 degrees fahrenheit throughout this century and as little as 0.0009 degrees over the entire century. [from the wall street journal] tilting at climate windmills nearly all of washington--democrats, the press, lobbyists-- is taking a victory lap with senate passage of the schumer- manchin tax, climate and drug price control bill. the climate lobby is especially thrilled, claiming a historic victory that will reduce temperatures, hold back the rising sea, and save the planet. or, maybe not. our contributor bjorn lomborg looked at the rhodium group estimate for co2 emissions reductions from schumer-manchin policies. he then plugged them into the united nations climate model to measure the impact on global temperature by 2100. he finds the bill will reduce the estimated global temperature rise at the end of this century by all of 0.028 degrees fahrenheit in the optimistic case. in the pessimistic case, the temperature difference will be 0.0009 degrees fahrenheit. in other words, the climate provisions in this ballyhooed legislation will have no notable impact on the climate. this is not surprising. no matter what the u.s. does to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, it will be dwarfed by what the rest of the world does. china, india and africa are not about to stop burning fossil fuels as they develop, and china is sprinting ahead to build huge new coal capacity despite its pledge to start reducing emissions after 2030. barring a breakthrough in battery or other technology, carbon emissions will continue to increase. no one knows how much the earth's temperature will warm, though even the u.n. model has modified its estimates from the apocalyptic predictions of some years ago. schumer-manchin will not reduce inflation, will not reduce the budget deficit, and it will not reduce the world's temperature. what it will do is transfer some $369 billion from taxpayers and drug companies to the pockets of green energy businesses and investors. it will tighten the hold that politicians have on the allocation of capital, as they pick winners and losers with their grants and tax credits. everyone will get a nice warm feeling as they pretend they are cooling the climate. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from new york (ms. malliotakis). ms. malliotakis. madam speaker, at a time when the country is facing a 40-year high rate of inflation, americans are struggling, the economy is contracting, and we are in a recession, they are jamming through a $750-billion bill with a slush fund that will only further fuel inflation, lead to higher energy costs, and drive up manufacturing costs as a supply chain crisis persists. what a lousy idea to raise taxes during a recession. this will not just hit businesses, but families earning as little as $50,000, and that is exactly why this bill is doubling the irs by 87,000 agents. this is a level that is: more than the population of biden's entire hometown of scranton, pennsylvania. more than the fans that can fill the metlife stadium where the giants play. three times the staff at the pentagon. four times the border patrol agents when we have a border crisis; and eight times the drug enforcement agents when fentanyl is taking record lives of young americans. this bill does not include one cop as crime is skyrocketing in cities like mine. this congress is disconnected with the real problems that americans face. to call this the inflation reduction act is a lie. mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. schneider), who is a very valued member of the ways and means committee. mr. schneider. madam speaker, i proudly rise today in support of the inflation reduction act. this historic bill will lower the cost of energy and healthcare for millions of americans. just as important, it makes the largest ever investment in tackling the climate crisis, helping us cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030. these historic investments will improve the lives of hardworking americans, all while reducing our deficit by $300 billion. this bill will allow the hhs secretary to negotiate the prices of some of the most expensive drugs. it caps the price of insulin at $35 for americans on medicare. it also includes expanded coverage for low- income medicare beneficiaries, which i have championed for years. on climate change, i am particularly proud that this bill includes my legislation, the sustainable skies act, that will help dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, which today accounts for 2 percent of the world's annual emissions. the bill also tackles the high energy costs that americans face with investments in consumer home energy, from rooftop solar panels to electric hvac systems. let me repeat: this bill is entirely and responsibly paid for and then some. again, our deficit will be cut by more than $300 billion by the action congress is taking today. madam speaker, americans have been hard hit by a once-in-a-century pandemic and then by the consequent effects of global inflation and supply chain crises. and every year the impacts of climate change become more severe and more costly. americans need relief. [[page h7675]] madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to vote for the inflation reduction act and give our fellow citizens the relief they deserve. mr. brady. madam speaker, i include in the record the following article by americans for tax reform, which debunks the inflation reduction act by describing the top five budget gimmicks in this bill, showing over $330 billion in fake savings, more than the so-called deficit reduction in the bill. 5 gimmicks in democrats' reconciliation bill democrats' reconciliation bill, improperly named the ``inflation reduction act,'' contains numerous gimmicks designed to deceive voters and circumvent congressional rules. this bill uses several budget gimmicks: a short extension of obamacare subsidies, a repeal of the ``rebate rule'' that never has nor never will go into effect, and supersizing the internal revenue service (irs) to ``solve'' an overstated tax gap, this bill attempts to circumvent the byrd rule by erroneously calling a mandate ``a tax.'' the bill would also violate president biden's tax pledge to not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. 1. the obamacare subsidies in this bill are only extended until 2025, despite expectations that they will be extended again. in the american rescue plan (arp), president biden and congressional democrats expanded obamacare subsidies-- specifically the advanced refundable premium tax credit--by increasing benefits for households at every income level and expanding them to households earning more than 400 percent of the federal poverty level. because these enhanced benefits are set to expire later this year, democrats are attempting to extend them through 2025 in this legislation. once these expanded subsidies have been in place for five years total, it will be extremely difficult to get rid of them. given the high likelihood--and expectation--that these subsidies will be extended once they are set to expire again, the three-year extension is a clear gimmick. if the expanded subsidies were extended indefinitely, the 10-year budget deficit reduction falls from $248 billion to $89 billion, according to the penn wharton budget model. 2. the bill repeals the ``rebate rule,'' despite the fact that it was never going into effect. under the trump administration, the hhs released the rebate rule which sought to lower drug prices by altering payments from drugmakers to pharmacy benefit managers. the trump administration never went through with this rule nor has the biden administration taken it back up again (to be clear, they never will). even so, democrats claim the repeal would reduce the deficit by $120 billion. clearly, it would not. already, between the likely extension of obamacare subsidies and this rebate rule, the bill does not actually reduce the deficit at all. 3. the irs would be supersized to solve an overstated ``tax gap.'' the joint committee on taxation estimates that $80 billion in additional funding to the irs would increase tax revenue by $125 billion. while increasing tax enforcement would certainly raise more money from unsuspecting small businesses, the left has assumed that this can and will be done through increased enforcement on the wealthy. in reality, wealthy individuals and large corporations are almost always tax compliant. the wealthy and large corporations already have armies of lawyers and accountants that ensure they legally take advantage of the plethora of credits and deductions offered by the tax code. further, the irs already audits the largest corporations at high rates. it does not matter how much more the agency receives in funding-- they will not find violations in the law that do not exist. thus, the irs will not find much more revenue from their big targets. additional funding will instead be used for invasive, time- consuming, and non-fruitful audits of middle-class americans and small businesses. the irs previously announced a goal to increase small business audits by 50 percent. as previously reported by cnbc, experts say a fattened-up irs would go after small businesses that necessarily depend on cash transactions. 4. the bill implements price controls through a 95 percent tax, the bill would give the health and human services secretary the authority to ``negotiate'' the price of prescription drugs on behalf of medicare. by ``negotiation,'' democrats mean drug manufacturers will pay a 95 percent excise tax on prescription drug profits unless they accept price controls set by the department of health and human services (hhs). in 2023, the secretary would be able to determine the prices of 10 prescription drugs. the determined price would go into effect in 2026. the number of drugs the hhs secretary could set prices for would then increase to 15 in 2028 and 20 in 2029. that tax itself is forecasted to raise zero revenue. neither the jct analysis nor any independent analyses estimate that any company would pay this exorbitant tax. a 95 percent ``tax'' on revenue is just a stick to enforce a mandate for government price controls. this is a way to circumvent the byrd rule, which requires that all the provisions in a reconciliation bill directly change federal spending or revenue. while a tax is obviously protected under this rule, it is not clear that mandates of this kind are. 5. the reconciliation bill raises taxes on those making less than $400,000, violating president biden's tax pledge. throughout the ten-year window, the jct estimates that nearly every single income group will see their taxes raised. those americans making less than $200,000 will see their taxes raised by nearly $17 billion. for those making between $200,000 and $500,000 (as the jct does not cut off brackets at $400,000), their taxes would increase by another $14 billion. senate finance ranking member mike crapo (r-idaho) rightly points out that at least half of all new tax revenue raised by this bill would come from those earning under $400,000. clearly, this tax hike violates president biden's pledge not to raise one penny of taxes on any american earning less than $400,000 per year. if biden and harris want to keep their pledge, they must veto the bill or instruct democrats to change the bill. mr. brady. i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from tennessee (mr. fleischmann). {time} 1415 mr. fleischmann. madam speaker, the dying ember that is the democratic majority in both houses once again seeks to burn the american people. $80 billion for the irs, and they champion it. i will stand with the hardworking american people of this nation. democrats, you can have the irs. raising taxes at a time of recession, at a time of economic gloom, i will stand with the hardworking entrepreneurs of america any time over raising taxes. madam speaker, the american people know better. the american people deserve better. the american people will get better in november. i urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the very capable gentlewoman from new york (ms. velazquez). ms. velazquez. madam speaker, i rise in strong support of this historic legislation. the climate crisis is the single-most important issue facing our future, the future we will all share, democrats and republicans. i understand this is a down payment on climate action and more needs to be done, but let us focus on what this bill does. it lowers the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs. it lowers energy costs and delivers the largest-ever climate action by investing in domestic energy production and manufacturing while reducing carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030. it lowers the deficit and helps fight inflation by making a historic payment on deficit reduction of $300 billion. we do this by making the biggest corporations and ultrawealthy pay their fair share in taxes. enough with the fear-mongering by the other side. let us get this done on behalf of hardworking families across america. mr. brady. madam speaker, i include the following polling reality study in the record, which shows that once americans learn the details of the so-called medicare negotiation, which is price setting, that their choices and access to lifesaving cures will be limited, public support for negotiation plummets. analysis: americans do not support surrendering innovation for democrats' drug price controls democrats are selling their socialist drug pricing scheme as a way to lower prices, but americans oppose it once they learn that this kills cures and life-improving treatments. what they are not telling you is this: their drug price control scheme will kill innovation, mean fewer new treatments and cures, and a loss of jobs in the biopharma industry. once americans learn about these consequences they reject it outright. furthermore, this is not a ``negotiation''-- democrats' proposal has washington dictate prices under threat of exorbitantly higher taxes on medical innovators. key takeaways: the vast majority of americans oppose government negotiation if it results in fewer new medicines being developed in the future a 50-state morning consult/phrma poll shows two thirds of americans oppose price controls if they put the government in [[page h7676]] charge and take away power from doctors to prescribe medicines that best meet the needs of patients. the kaiser family foundation also finds that democrats' price control scheme drops in popularity the moment respondents see that it could lead to less research and development of new drugs or limit access to newer prescription drugs. a march 2022 ipsos/phrma poll reveals only 14 percent of americans support washington price controls if they limit their access to newer prescription medicines. even if it ``only'' delays access, only 15 percent support the proposal then. the same poll shows that seniors are even more skeptical-- 10 percent support the price controls when they learn of how it delays people's access to new medicines. numerous studies show the proposal would kill new treatments, including a university of chicago study that shows the number going up to 342 democrats' price-fixing scheme would kill up to 342 cures, according to a study by the university of chicago, yet they claim it is merely a ``negotiating'' approach that would lower the price of drugs. a new study from vital transformation finds that if drug price controls under consideration in the senate had been enacted during the last decade, only six of 110 currently approved therapies would have made it to patients. loss of innovation = a death sentence for patients. looking at cms drug utilization data from 2016 to 2020 of the types of drugs expected to be most impacted by democrats' price fixing, even the most conservative estimates of innovation lost from these policies could have left over 42 million patients without the medicine they needed. surrendering in the fight against cancer: the council of state bio associations writes that socialist drug price controls will get in the way of the fight against cancer: ``in oncology alone, the university of chicago found that price controls would reduce overall annual cancer r&d spending by about $18.1 billion, or 31.8 percent.'' they continue: ``the specter of government price setting threatens to undermine a sector that has created over 1.8 million jobs across all 50 states and that represents a large portion of our nation's gross domestic product (gdp)-- generating an economic output of approximately $2.6 trillion annually.'' limiting patients' access to low-cost medicines: back in march, medical innovators wrote to congress that ``the untested approach in the house-passed build back better act (h.r. 5376) does not address these challenges and could in fact harm future savings from generic and biosimilar medicines. the build back better act's approach to direct negotiations in medicare and inflation-based penalties, as passed by the house, would alter the incentive for generic and biosimilar manufacturers to develop new medicines [. . .] and is misguided and would limit patients' access to low-cost medicines.'' the bipartisan solution that works: the lower costs, more cures act (h.r. 19) lowers costs for all prescription drugs every provision in h.r. 19 is bipartisan. it will lower health care costs and ensure america leads in health care innovation for more cures and treatments. it gives patients more drug price transparency and ensures public disclosure of drug costs and discounts. it increases low-cost options by bringing more generic and biosimilar competition to the marketplace fast. it caps seniors' out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $50 per month. it allows high deductible health insurance plans to cover insulin before the deductible kicks in. a new large-scale survey of 20,000 americans covering all 50 states and 435 congressional districts shows a majority of americans find health care coverage costs unreasonable and a priority health care issue for policymakers to address today. the survey also shows that a majority of voters in every state and district oppose medicare ``negotiation'' once they learn the policy could harm access and innovation. here are the key findings from the survey: a majority of americans in every state and the district of columbia oppose government ``negotiation'' as a way to address health care costs if it could: take away power from doctors to prescribe the medicines that best meet the needs of their patients, and instead put the government in charge of those decisions--on average 66% oppose. limit people's access to newer prescription drugs--on average 64% oppose. reduce access to medicines for seniors and people with disabilities--on average 62% oppose. americans concerned with rising health care costs believe congress should prioritize reducing the overall cost of coverage: 30% of americans, on average, are concerned with out-of- pocket costs not covered by insurance and 29% are concerned with the cost of health insurance premiums. 66% of americans, on average, believe congress should focus on reducing the overall cost of health care coverage, (23% of americans want them to focus on prescription drug costs, and 13% do not know enough to say). 66% of americans from all states and congressional districts, on average, find their out-of-pocket health care costs ``unreasonable.'' americans are clear in their opposition to so-called medicare ``negotiation'' policies. they want congress to focus on patient-centered solutions that address the real health care issues they face, like rising out-of-pocket costs and health insurance premiums, while preserving access, innovation and choice. learn how at phrma.org/betterway. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert). mr. gohmert. madam speaker, this is the bill, 728 pages, that we got from the senate this week. has anybody read it? come on. that is over a billion dollars average per page. that am not gold; that is fool's gold. look, more irs agents, as art laffer said years ago, that is not going to increase the amount of revenue to the government, and, in fact, when you say it is going after the ultrarich, what happens is the ultrarich are the only ones that can avoid paying taxes. they can hire attorneys, accountants. they can move, change their business structure. it comes right back to the middle class every time. these same policies are the reasons that the average black household in the 8 years of obama lost 30 percent of their net worth. we keep hearing from the other side that there is this runaway inflation, and this ugly bill is going to stop it. well, our president said it is zero percent inflation. somebody is lying. we will find out who. mr. neal. i will be the first to acknowledge that, madam speaker. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. brady. madam speaker, on behalf of many diabetes patients, i include the following article in the record, which includes a quote from my fellow texan, representative lloyd doggett, where he accurately states that the insulin caps policy included in this bill ``does not lower the price of insulin by one penny,'' but, rather, shifts costs to others. insulin copay cap passes house hurdle, but senate looks for a broader bill (by michael mcauliff) the chances of passing election-year legislation to help people afford insulin--which weeks ago seemed mired in political fighting--are looking brighter as a bipartisan effort to tackle the issue takes root in the senate. that effort is still in the early stages, but it is moving forward with the support of senate majority leader chuck schumer, who tapped sens. susan collins (r-maine) and jeanne shaheen (d-n.h.) to craft a compromise that members of both parties could accept. adding pressure to the senate's efforts was a vote by the house on march 31 to pass a different bill that caps out-of-pocket insulin costs for many patients with insurance at $35 a month. collins said in an interview march 30 that the two senators had come up with an outline based on a bill they worked on three years ago that goes beyond capping what diabetes patients pay and aims to bring down the prices drugmakers charge. ``it tackles the broader issue of the high list price for insulin, and the conflicts of interests that occur in the chain from manufacturer to the consumer buying it at the pharmacy counter,'' collins said. the idea of reducing patients' out-of-pocket insulin costs is immensely popular, and more than half of the public sees it as a ``top priority'' for congress, according to a kff poll out last week. it had been a key selling point of president joe biden's build back better plan, but when that legislation stalled, biden and schumer gave sen. raphael warnock (d-ga.) an open lane to promote a stand-alone measure identical to the house bill that caps insulin costs at $35 a month for people with private insurance and medicare coverage. the political climate, however, presented roadblocks. the odds that a bill sponsored by a democrat facing a tough reelection in the fall could get enough republicans in the senate on board seemed slim, and even some democrats were nervous about stripping the insulin provisions from a possible revised version of the build back better bill. so schumer embraced a different option from collins and shaheen that would include a cap on out-of-pocket costs and possibly draw more votes. insulin prices have spiked dramatically since the early 2000s, with americans paying 10 times what people in other developed countries pay. although collins said details are still being worked out, her legislation would be based on the pair's earlier bill, the insulin price reduction act of 2019, which aimed to roll insulin costs back to what they were in 2006. it would have done that by barring rebate payments for insulin to pharmacy benefit managers--those intermediaries who negotiate price breaks for insurance companies and determine which drugs the insurance plans cover. collins and other critics of pbms believe they inflate prices because they favor higher-priced drugs from which they can extract a larger rebate and therefore more profit, which gives drugmakers extra incentive to raise list prices. [[page h7677]] under that 2019 plan, drug manufacturers who agreed to return to 2006 costs could then raise prices each year only at the rate of medical inflation. the senators estimated the plan would lead to a 75 percent cut in prices from those listed in 2020. ``there is a very complex system which essentially encourages high list prices, because the pharmacy benefit managers frequently receive a percentage of the list price,'' collins said. ``so their incentive is to choose one that is higher-cost. and so we are trying to address that broader issue, as well as looking at the out-of-pocket costs.'' warnock's proposal to cap the cost of insulin is silent on list prices and benefit managers, an omission some democrats complained about even as they voted for the similar bill in the house. they noted that since insurers would likely be forced to absorb the costs no longer paid by patients, the companies would likely raise premiums. ``this bill does not lower the price of insulin by one penny,'' said rep. lloyd doggett (d-texas). ``it just shifts the burden of paying for the insulin off of the shoulders of insured insulin users, and shifts it on to the rest of all of us who are paying insurance premiums.'' collins also noted that the uninsured would not benefit from the house cap, which applies to medicare and insurance companies but does not affect drugmakers' prices. ``it does not help someone who is uninsured,'' collins said. ``when you address the high list price, then it is going to help more people.'' collins warned that much could change as lawmakers keep working with various stakeholders on a final bill, including diabetes advocacy groups, the centers for medicare & medicaid services, and the congressional budget office. and as caps on out-of-pocket expenses and list-price changes start interacting, things get complicated, indeed. ``we are talking to cbo, which says it is so complex that they need a new model,'' collins said. the politics also remains tricky. collins and shaheen never got their measure close to the senate floor in 2019 and 2020 when senate minority leader mitch mcconnell was majority leader. they did attract some praise from both sides of the aisle, and conservative north dakota republican sen. kevin cramer was a co-sponsor. while that opens the door to gop support, collins said she was still only at the stage of circulating among her colleagues what she called a discussion draft. republicans in the house who voted against the $35-cap bill panned it as a political stunt, saying democrats should have advanced ideas that had been worked on with republicans. such objections could not block the bill in the house. but in the senate, democrats command only 50 votes, and it would take 60 to pass the legislation. although gop members of the upper chamber might also be opposed to warnock's bill, one of the house sponsors argued that having the house advance a dramatic cut in insulin costs--with the support of only a dozen republicans--would raise the stakes for the senate. ``if 10 republicans stand between americans being able to get access to insulin or not, that is a good question for 10 republican [senators] to have to answer when they go back home,'' rep. dan kildee (d-mich.) said ahead of the house vote. ``so we are gonna pass this bill, and this will put the pressure on the senate to act.'' he and his fellow democratic co-sponsors also signaled their willingness to take a measure that included the shaheen and collins additions. ``any train that is leaving the station that gets folks affordable insulin--i am open to any vehicle,'' kildee said. ``we think this is a solution that would work. how it gets to the president's desk, i am agnostic on that question. any way we can get it there.'' mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ohio (mr. jordan). mr. jordan. madam speaker, who are they going to harass? who are these thousands of irs bureaucrats, leftwing bureaucrats, lois lerners at the irs, who are they going to harass? middle-class families. we know who it is going to be. it is that assistant football coach at the local high school who teaches history and who has this side business. he mows lawns in the summer. he paints houses in the summer. he pays his taxes, but he is going to get harassed. we know how this works. we have seen it before. this bill raises taxes. it creates a whole new bureaucracy to go after taxpayers. such a deal, using your tax money to come after you, the taxpayer. such a deal for the taxpayer. my guess is they will all be working remotely. they will not have to pay the $5 to drive to work like people in our districts do. they will be working remotely, drinking their fancy coffee, going after the guy who is helping kids and has this side business in the summer. that is who this is going to come after, and we all know it. everyone knows it. the country knows it. this is disgusting. i hope you all vote ``no.'' mr. neal. madam speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. brady. madam speaker, on behalf of seniors who rely on generic drugs, i include in the record the following letter from generic and biosimilar manufacturers, which explains the price controls in this democrat bill will reduce competition from lower-cost generic and biosimilar medicines. that means fewer options for patients and worsening drug shortages. the biosimilars council, washington, dc, july 11, 2022. hon. charles e. schumer, majority leader, u.s. senate, washington, dc. dear leader schumer: the association for accessible medicines (aam) and its biosimilars council share in the goal of lowering prescription drug costs for america's patients and seniors. however, in an effort to target high prices on brand-name drugs, the proposed prescription drugs reforms--in particular the medicare negotiations framework--being considered as part of a revised reconciliation package will reduce patient savings from lower-cost generic and biosimilar medicines. even though competition from generic and biosimilar medicines is the only proven solution to consistently lower the cost of prescription drugs, the proposed price setting scheme will reduce competition, harm future savings from generic and biosimilar medicines, and increase costs for employers and patients with private insurance. we thus urge all u.s. senators to oppose the prescription drug reforms under consideration as part of a revised build back better reconciliation package. america's patients rightfully expect congress to address the ever-increasing prices of brandname prescription drugs. high launch prices on new brand biologics, combined with an increasing trend of anti-competitive patent and rebate ploys designed to delay or prevent competition from more affordable biosimilars and generics, are keeping access to medicines out of reach for too many patients. these dynamics are compounded by flawed policies that reward health plans and pharmacy benefit managers (pbms) for the use of high-cost, high-rebate brand drugs and that allow plans and pbms to raise out-of- pocket costs for generics, even as the prices for those same generics are falling. as a result, patients, including medicare's seniors, are missing out on billions of dollars in savings from biosimilars and generic drugs each year. however, the proposed price setting approach fails to adequately address these challenges, while dampening future competition and reducing savings from generic and biosimilar medicines. negotiations framework increases uncertainty for generic and biosimilar developers the proposal increases the risks associated with developing generic and biosimilars without addressing the fundamental barriers to competition from lower-cost medicines, such as abuses of the patent system and brand rebate traps. the proposed timelines for when the secretary can initiate the price setting process will significantly increase the risk to develop new lower-cost generics and biosimilars. although the proposal exempts drugs with generic or biosimilar competition from the price setting process, the bill only does so through unrealistic timelines for that competition to enter the market. for many complex generics and biosimilars, it can take 8-10 years to develop new, more affordable medicines. and it can take many more years to conclude patent litigation and then launch a complex generic or biosimilar medicine. but the new price setting process would not begin until years after a developer commits to developing a lower-cost generic or biosimilar. this means that generic and biosimilar manufacturers will have no way to know whether a brand-name drug will be selected for negotiation or what the negotiated price may be. this dynamic fundamentally changes the ability of generic and biosimilar manufacturers to plan and make investment decisions that can be up to and exceed $250 million per drug. while the revised bill includes a provision that could allow for a temporary delay of the negotiated price if the secretary determines a biosimilar launch was imminent, there are a number of limitations on the provision make it difficult to utilize. by way of example, a biosimilar developer would need to show a ``high likelihood'' of biosimilar competition by a ``clear and convincing'' evidentiary standard. moreover, the narrow two-year window to launch does not appropriately account for how long it takes developers to challenge brand-name patents. large patent estates and time-consuming patent litigation are currently and will continue to prevent biosimilars from being able to launch within two years of receiving fda approval. these dynamics will likely deter manufacturers from making investments in biosimilar and generic medicines in some instances--and will result in less competition and ultimately higher costs for patients. generic and biosimilar medicines savings exceeds potential from negotiations framework after years of high-risk investment, biosimilar developers are poised to deliver tremendous savings to the u.s. health care system, improving access for patients and lowering prescription drug costs. new [[page h7678]] biosimilars are expected to launch for a range of treatments for patients with diabetes, arthritis, macular degeneration, oncology and more. in the next few years, 42 biosimilars are on track to launch. gold-standard data firm iqvia estimates biosimilar savings of $30 billion annually as a result. in comparison, the congressional budget office estimates the negotiations framework saves $18-24 billion per year from 2028 to 2031. thus, more savings is projected from market- based competition than from the build back better proposal and it starts now. in addition, as more complex generics, biosimilars, and interchangeable biologics become available, there is the potential for even greater savings to the u.s. health care system as providers and payers take advantage of the opportunities to increase access and reduce costs for patients. negotiations framework increases costs on employers and patients with private coverage reduced competition from generic and biosimilar medicines impacts all patients, not only medicare beneficiaries. the dampening effect this legislation would have on competition would cause employers and patients with private insurance to lose savings these populations have historically enjoyed from robust generic competition and growing biosimilar competition. instead, there may be fewer new, more affordable generic and biosimilar medicines, leaving the commercial and employer markets captive to the high cost of brand-name drugs. when reviewing a nearly identical proposal in the house- passed build back better act, aam's biosimilars council assessed the potential lost savings to the commercial market for medicines used to treat asthma (xolair) and rheumatoid arthritis (orencia), as examples. for just two products, lost savings would be between $4-$7 billion between 2027-2030. this is lost savings that would otherwise be used to lower patient out of pocket costs and reduce insurance premiums for employers and employees. for these reasons, we must oppose the medicare negotiations framework and its impact on patient access to lower-cost medicines. there are other bipartisan steps to address patent abuse and brand rebate traps that are already under discussion in congress that can meaningfully reduce drugs costs without harming generic and biosimilar savings. we strongly encourage congress to reconsider its approach. sincerely, dan leonard, president and ceo. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from tennessee (mr. burchett). mr. burchett. madam speaker, following jim jordan is like why nobody wanted to follow jimi hendrix at woodstock. it is going to be tough. but you never reduce burdens or inflation by increasing taxes $740 billion. it is estimated that there is a $4,500 increase on the average family under this proposal. instead, you simply create more government that never goes away. this is not an inflation reduction act. it is a woke climate bill that will increase inflation, madam speaker. madam speaker, my democrat friends seem to have forgotten that capitalism is not the enemy; we are. i would also remind my colleagues across the aisle that, in tennessee, we reduced taxes and regulations, and now we have record surpluses. individuals and businesses are moving from your district to mine as fast as they can get there. madam speaker, the ranking member, who i call chairman, will be incredibly missed here in these halls, but also more so out on the baseball field. mr. neal. madam speaker, i am prepared to close. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. brady. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. i include in the record the following list of 586

brady. i include in the record the following letter from dozens of main street businesses opposing the democrats' bill because of the irs' targeting of their business under the bill and tax hikes on small businesses. august 11, 2022. hon. nancy pelosi, speaker of the house, house of representatives, washington, dc. hon. kevin mccarthy, house minority leader, house of representatives, washington, dc. hon. charles schumer, senate majority leader, u.s. senate, washington, dc. hon. mitch mcconnell, senate minority leader, u.s. senate, washington, dc. dear speaker pelosi, leader mccarthy, leader schumer, and leader mcconnell: the undersigned organizations represent millions of main street businesses and employ tens of millions of workers and we oppose the senate-passed inflation reduction act. inflation is at 40-year highs, we have had two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, and we are witnessing a shrinking small business sector, yet the inflation reduction act does nothing to address these immediate issues even as it increases the burden of the tax code shouldered by america's small and family-owned businesses. the biden administration claims the savings in the ira are ``front-loaded'' and will reduce the deficit in the short- term, helping to ease inflationary pressures. that is simply not the case. recent analysis by the congressional budget office, penn-wharton, and others shows the inflation reduction act would increase prices in the short term and do little to bring them down in the long run. at the same time, the bill would give the irs an additional $80 billion in funding, more than half of which would pay for thousands of additional irs agents to conduct millions of additional audits. we support addressing the tax gap and oppose illegal tax evasion, but as former national taxpayer advocate nina olson observed recently, it is wrong and counterproductive to characterize the entire tax gap as willful tax evasion. from experience, we know many, if not most, of these additional audits will be conducted on the owners of family businesses who have fully complied with the tax code. finally, the warner amendment adopted at the last minute presented the senate with a clear choice between wall street and main street, and the senate chose wall street. the amendment extends for two years the section 461(l) cap on losses a business owner is permitted to claim. this $52 billion tax hike on pass-through businesses was adopted with almost no consideration, and the revenues it raises were used to offset the cost of exempting private equity investors from the fifteen-percent corporate minimum tax. the cap on active pass-through less deductions is bad policy at any time, but it is particularly harmful when the economy is weak and an increasing number of businesses are suffering losses. the timing of this amendment's adoption could not have been worse. the inflation reduction act would fail to reduce price pressures even as it raises the cost of the tax code to small and family-owned businesses at a time of economic weakness. we ask that you reject the ira's main street tax hike when it is considered by the full house. sincerely, aahoa; aicc, the independent packaging association; air conditioning contractors of america; american building materials alliance (abma); american hotel and lodging

families and main street businesses have been facing and continue to face historic inflation and, now, a recession. this bill is a hoax on the american people. americans who are suffering the most in president biden's cruel economy will soon know this firsthand. they will know it because inflation will get worse, according to the penn wharton school of business analysis. parents sitting up at night will notice higher taxes, fewer jobs, and lower wages as they pay for the vast majority of any new revenue collected under this bill, according to congress' own nonpartisan scorekeeper. a middle-income single mom with two kids who runs her own business will know it when she comes home from walmart and finds a letter from the irs telling her she is under audit. seniors and loved ones with life-threatening illnesses will arrive at the pharmacy counter and break into a sweat when they see they cannot afford their medicine. families with loved ones newly diagnosed with alzheimer's, or cancer, or als, and desperately seeking treatment will wonder whether the cure for their disease will ever come. the wealthiest and the biggest foreign-owned corporations will do just [[page h7680]] fine. they are getting hundreds of billions of dollars of government handouts under this bill. after all, they get the government checks paid for by the middle-class taxpayers who are getting squeezed. this is a sad day for struggling american families and main street businesses. this economy is cruel enough, but by voting to turn this hoax into law, congress is inflicting one more act of cruelty. madam speaker, i urge opposition to this bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. neal. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. this is a big day, and this is a big deal. we are putting people out front and making good on the promises we have made, lowering drug prices and investing in our climate. a mountain-high pile of legislative achievements have we: the american rescue plan, the chips and science act, and now this achievement for the american people. lyndon johnson was right: ``yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose.'' with the inflation reduction act headed to the president's desk--and give joe biden credit--we stand here assured that tomorrow is ours to win. we have had bold dreams in this congress, and we have delivered big on those dreams. none of this would have been possible without the dedication and expertise of the staff of the ways and means committee, the best in the business. they have worked nonstop for 2 years for the american people, and today, their hard work is on display for the world to witness and await the president's signature. the inflation reduction act sets our nation on a healthier, fairer, and more prosperous path. madam speaker, i urge our colleagues to support this critical legislation, and i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pallone) and the gentleman from kentucky (mr. guthrie) will each control 30 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new jersey. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield myself 3 minutes. madam speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 5376, the inflation reduction act. this is landmark legislation that is going to help reduce costs for american families while finally aggressively tackling the climate crisis. madam speaker, we simply cannot wait any longer to confront the climate crisis. extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more extreme. there are record-high temperatures across the nation this summer. these extreme weather events cost families their loved ones, their homes, and their livelihoods. this bill is the single largest investment in climate action in american history. we heard from the ways and means committee about the tax credits, the investment production tax credits for renewables, for electric vehicles. i want to talk about the provisions from the energy and commerce committee. the bill makes unparalleled investments in climate, clean energy, and environmental justice so that we can slash climate pollution and meet our aggressive climate goals. i want to highlight some of the things: a methane emissions reduction program, a greenhouse gas reduction fund to promote new green technology, investing in manufacturing that is green, reducing industrial emissions; a program for states and government entities to reduce climate pollution, a program for clean heavy-duty vehicles for trucks and school buses to make them less polluting, an appliance and building efficiency rebate to try to deal with emissions from buildings and appliances, an industrial emissions reduction program; environmental and climate justice block grants, and also provisions to deal with ports that are a major source of pollution. all of these are designed, basically, to try to create clean jobs and to reduce energy costs for the average family. we estimate it at about $1,800 a year. it is estimated that this bill will actually reduce the pollution of greenhouse gases into the climate by 40 percent, in terms of what the u.s. has emitted since 2005. it goes very far toward achieving our goals as a nation, toward reducing the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. {time} 1430 in addition to that, the inflation reduction act is also one of the most significant pieces of healthcare legislation moved through congress in over a decade. i want to stress this: it breaks big pharma's monopoly on prescription drug prices. the bill will lower prescription drug costs for seniors by finally empowering medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs. it also caps the amount that seniors pay at $2,000 annually, caps the cost of insulin at $35 a month, and penalizes companies that unfairly hike prices by forcing them to pay a rebate to the federal government if their prices rise more than inflation. this legislation is necessary because, nearly 20 years ago, republicans prevented the federal government from negotiating prices for seniors. so, today, we are finally leveling the playing field to ensure seniors are no longer forced to choose between putting food on their tables and their life savings. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield myself an additional 30 seconds. finally, i want to say that this legislation will also dramatically lower the cost of healthcare for millions of americans by extending enhanced affordable care act marketplace premium subsidies. these enhanced subsidies are making a real difference for families, delivering an average savings of $2,400 a year for a family of four. they are set to expire at the end of the year, but this bill extends them through the end of 2025. madam speaker, this legislation lays the foundation for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all americans. i urge my colleagues to support it, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield myself 5 minutes. madam speaker, i rise today in strong opposition to h.r. 5376, the mislabeled inflation reduction act. this is another reckless tax and spending spree that is not being accurately portrayed to the american people by democrats. washington democrats are trying to convince americans that adding more reckless government spending and raising taxes during a recession will combat inflation. even nonpartisan organizations say this bill will have virtually no impact on inflation and at least half of the expected tax revenue for next year is estimated to come from americans making less than $400,000 a year. americans will see more irs audits because this bill gives the irs the ability to hire an army of new irs agents. people should pay the taxes they owe, but instead of an army of irs agents focusing on auditing low- to middle-income americans, we need to put our resources into hiring more border patrol officers to protect the border and stop the flow of illicit drugs such as fentanyl. more troubling parts of this bill are the healthcare provisions. i strongly disagree with using medicare money to pay for obamacare subsidies for the wealthy. i introduced an amendment to keep medicare savings in medicare, which is already at risk of insolvency in the very near future. unfortunately, house democrats did not even give this amendment a chance to be considered. while democrats praise government price setting, or, as they call it, negotiation, they fail to mention that such policies would lead to at least 15 fewer drugs coming to market, according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office. what are the 15 cures? could it be the cure for alzheimer's? could it be the cure for diabetes? it could be. they also will not mention that the nonpartisan cbo said this bill will lead to higher prices on new drugs. finally, democrats are voting to give secretary becerra a $3 billion slush fund to set drug prices, despite hhs botching the response to the covid-19 pandemic, including politicizing guidance that kept schools closed and young children masked in head start programs. how can anyone support giving billions of dollars in more unrestricted authority to hhs that we know will lead to fewer cures for our loved ones? let me be clear: we absolutely need to address the cost of prescription [[page h7681]] medication. in the energy and commerce committee, there is a bipartisan bill ready to go, h.r. 19, that could achieve this, but the democrats have repeatedly refused to bring the bill to the floor for a vote. our country is also facing an energy crisis created by president biden and washington democrats' war on american energy. despite this, the democrats' solution is to double down on the nearly $400 billion to be spent on far-left green new deal policies and impose billions of dollars of tax increases on energy that will be passed to consumers. unbelievably, even as energy prices are at historically high levels, they have included a new tax on natural gas and revived a tax on petroleum products that will cost consumers tens of billions of dollars. i filed an amendment to exempt our defense bases from this natural gas tax, but again, democrats refused even to consider it. democrats want to create a $27 billion slush fund at the epa for a national climate bank to subsidize the solar energy that is heavily dominated by the chinese communist party and even spend $9 billion in rebates for wealthy americans to green up their homes with new appliances and electric vehicles. to conclude, this legislation not only crushes hope for patients and their families living with devastating diseases that currently lack a treatment or a cure, but it also significantly undermines our economic and national security. i cannot vote for the more appropriately named inflation expansion act. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from delaware (ms. blunt rochester), my neighbor from the state of delaware and a member of the committee on energy and commerce. ms. blunt rochester. madam speaker, today, i rise in support of the inflation reduction act. oh, what a day in america. from lowering prescription drug prices for seniors, to closing tax loopholes on the wealthiest corporations, to making the largest investment in clean energy in history to tackle the climate crisis, the inflation reduction act will help improve the lives of every single american. it will do it all while paying down the deficit. i am particularly proud that the bill includes my climate smart ports provisions with my colleague, ms. barragan, which invests in ports across the nation, like the port of wilmington, allowing them to upgrade their facilities, lower their carbon footprint, and create more good-paying union jobs. madam speaker, in a session of congress that has already seen remarkable landmark legislation passed, the inflation reduction act is the capstone of our efforts to deliver. with this bill, we continue to put people over politics. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. upton), the chair emeritus of the committee on energy and commerce, who is retiring. we are going to miss him. mr. upton. madam speaker, does anyone actually believe this bill is going to reduce inflation? i did not think so. those of you that know me know that i am not afraid to work across the aisle on important legislation that helps americans, whether it was the 21st century cures act, the chips act, the veterans' pact act, or the infrastructure bill. unfortunately, the bill that we are debating right now was not created in that same bipartisan manner. our economy is in a fragile state as we emerge from this pandemic. we have seen decades-high inflation that is crushing main street and squeezing the middle class. now is not the time to raise taxes to the tune of over $16 billion on middle-income folks around the country. the inflation reduction act does nothing to fix the insidious problems at the irs. instead, they are going to throw more than $80 billion to hire more agents who are going to be tasked with hounding taxpayers who report passthrough business income through schedule c and schedule e. these folks are, by and large, middle-income, family-owned small business owners who busted their butts to keep their doors open through the pandemic, and now we are sending the cavalry after them, leading to higher compliance costs and time wasted that will increase costs for all americans. the irs needs to be focused on clearing the backlog of millions of personal and business returns. i have literally helped hundreds of constituents who have been waiting 1 to 2 years for their tax refunds. with respect to inflation, a number of nonpartisan sources, including some previously touted by supporters of this bill, have said that this bill will cause inflation to increase over the first couple of years. the energy sector has seen the brunt of this increase, with gas prices climbing more than $2.30 a gallon and natural gas prices going up close to double. on wednesday, i offered an amendment at the committee on rules that would direct the bill not to go into effect until the secretary of energy can certify that energy prices are below the costs of 2021. madam speaker, i ask my colleagues to vote ``no.'' mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from illinois (mr. casten). mr. casten. madam speaker, last november, our house delegation went to glasgow for the cop26 conference. we told the world that we were back, that we had rejoined the paris climate accord, and that we were committed to building back better and committed to putting science over politics. it felt pretty good. but to be blunt, the world did not believe us. as we sat at that press conference, all of these reporters from europe said: what about the senate? what about the filibuster? what if republicans take over in the midterms? they had heard this song before. they admired our enthusiasm, but as you know, madam speaker, they really did not share it. today, we are going to prove them wrong. we are going to remind them what the united states is capable of. we are about to pass the most impactful climate bill ever. you all should be proud of that. you were here to share this moment with us. we are on the path to reducing co 2 emissions by 40 percent by 2030. that is a really big deal. but it is only a start because 40 percent am not enough. we have reestablished u.s. credibility today, but we still have to establish u.s. leadership. the measure of our success is not what we pass today; it is whether the planet is cooler tomorrow. today, we remind the world and ourselves what we are capable of. i hope we celebrate. but tomorrow, let us get back to work. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. ruiz), a member of the committee on energy and commerce. mr. ruiz. madam speaker, as a doctor, i have taken care of many patients who put their lives and health at risk because they could not afford their medication, patients who either ration their medicine or did not get a prescription filled at all. i will never forget one woman who was so proud to tell me that she was able to make her insulin last longer because she would only take half a dose at a time in order to make it last. this is unacceptable. no one should have to choose between whether to take their medicine and put food on their table or between their health and not being able to pay their bills. that is why i support the inflation reduction act, which will give seniors the relief that they need from skyrocketing drug costs. it ensures that people on medicare with diabetes will not have to pay more than $35 a month for their insulin. it requires the secretary of hhs to negotiate drug prices for expensive medicare drugs, lowering costs for seniors and people with disabilities, and it caps out-of-pocket spending at $2,000 per year for medicare part d. these important steps will help ensure that all seniors have access to lifesaving and health-saving medications, regardless of how much money they have. [[page h7682]] that is not all this bill does. this bill will make transformational investments to combat climate change and reduce our carbon emissions. it will push automakers to make their electric vehicle batteries with domestic materials, like the lithium we are extracting at the southern end of the salton sea in imperial county. with this bill and the lithium in my district, we can power our clean energy future here in america with american materials. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. burgess), my good friend on the committee on energy and commerce. mr. burgess. madam speaker, i thank the gentleman from kentucky for yielding. madam speaker, i include in the record a letter submitted by the members of the house gop doctors caucus. congress of the united states, house of representatives, washington, dc, august 6, 2022. hon. chuck schumer, majority leader, u.s. senate, washington, dc. hon. nancy pelosi, speaker of the house, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear leader schumer and speaker pelosi: we write to express our strong opposition to the government drug price control policies in your reconciliation package. as medical providers and members of congress, we are deeply concerned with the harm these provisions will cause to patients across the country. the gop doctors caucus has continuously worked to ensure that physician practices can stay open to continue treating patients. we have heard directly from providers that the cuts proposed in this bill will jeopardize patient access to care. according to avalere, changes to the medicare part b physician-administered drug reimbursement would lead to an average cut of 39.8 percent for health care providers. the confluence of these cuts, including the 0 percent payment update, the reduction of the 4.5 percent medicare conversion factor, and the adoption of several changes to the evaluation and management (e/m) current procedural terminology codes, threatens the sustainability of medical practices and will lead to physicians closing their doors. it is irresponsible to divert seniors' medicare dollars to pay subsidies to non-medicare insurance companies, yet this plan would do just that. the proposal will take ``savings'' from the drug price controls in the medicare program to pay for expanded health insurance subsidies under the affordable care act (aca). this is money going to insurance companies and their bottom line; this is not money going directly towards care in any way. these expanded subsidies were originally part of the inflation-creating american rescue plan act (arpa). arpa removed the income cap restricting access to premium tax credits, opening the door to taxpayer- funded subsidies for some of the wealthiest americans. some families making more than $500,000 annually now have access to expanded aca subsidies, and they will continue to if this proposal goes through. robbing medicare to enhance the profit for insurance company shareholders and executives does nothing to improve anyone's health. to us, this is unconscionable. if this plan is passed into law, millions of patients could die waiting for new drugs and cures that will no longer be developed in their lifetime. government price controls have consequences. the congressional budget office has conservatively estimated that 15 fewer drugs will be developed over the next 30 years under this bill, another study found that only six out of 11 currently approved therapies would have been brought to the market if this framework were in place. any cure lost is one too many. as members of congress who have been involved in patient care, we understand the real- world impact that this will have on patients. many of us have treated patients with chronic and life-threatening diseases. we have seen expensive surgeries and intensive inpatient care be eliminated by the development of new therapies. this development and innovation will all but go away, leaving patients without hope for improved quality of life and long- term savings. we remain concerned that this proposal will also put the government in control of americans' medical decisions. this is another clear example of a policy crafted by politicians who have never seen a patient. the bill calls for a 95 percent excise tax if drug companies do not accept the price government bureaucrats put in place. top down, ``take it or leave it'' government price negotiation is not a negotiation at all--it is government price fixing. this reconciliation package under consideration applies upward pressure on drug pricing. the bill subjects a company to negotiation once its seven-year exclusivity expires. as a result, companies could introduce drugs into the marketplace with high list prices, causing premium increases for healthier individuals enrolled in employer-sponsored plans. in summary, this reconciliation package will have grave consequences for patients and patient care: this price setting scheme put forth in this bill will endanger patient access to care by cutting provider reimbursement on impacted part b drugs by an average of forty percent. the bill does nothing to address other ongoing medicare provider payment cuts set to begin in 2023. if this plan is passed into law, millions of patients could die waiting for new drugs and cures that will no longer be developed in their lifetime. government price controls have consequences, and one lost cure is one too many. this plan robs medicare to pay subsidies to insurance companies and other non-health related expenditures. as medical providers in congress, we urge you to recognize the danger this proposal will have on patients. we can and should work on a bipartisan basis to lower drug costs without sacrificing the cures and treatments that will provide for a healthier future. sincerely, brad r. wenstrup, d.p.m., member of congress;

we are fighting inflation; and we are saving the planet. this is the largest investment to resolve the climate crisis in our nation's history. it will reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030. when generations look back years from now, they will read that this was a turning point. how many more category 5 hurricanes, how many more massive wildfires, deadly floods, dried-up rivers, and record heat waves do you need? how many more seniors have to get sick or die because they cannot afford their medication? how many more families have to be kicked off their health insurance? how much longer before you all get it? we are not waiting any longer. the republicans' plan is to do nothing. in contrast, we in the democratic majority will lead. today, we will act. today, we will do what is necessary to protect this generation and the next. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i include in the record an editorial from the wall street journal titled, ``tilting at climate windmills,'' which notes that the massive spending bill reduces global temperatures at the most by 0.28 degrees. [from the wall street journal] tilting at climate windmills shumer-manchin will have little effect on the world's temperature (by editorial board) nearly all of washington--democrats, the press, lobbyists-- is taking a victory lap with senate passage of the schumer- manchin tax, climate and drug price control bill. the climate lobby is especially thrilled, claiming a historic victory that will reduce temperatures, hold back the rising sea, and save the planet. or, maybe not. our contributor bjorn lomborg looked at the rhodium group estimate for co2 emissions reductions from schumer-manchin policies. he then plugged them into the united nations climate model to measure the impact on global temperature by 2100. he finds the bill will reduce the estimated global temperature rise at the end of this century by all of 0.028 degrees fahrenheit in the optimistic case. in the pessimistic case, the temperature difference will be 0.0009 degrees fahrenheit. in other words, the climate provisions in this ballyhooed legislation will have no notable impact on the climate. this is not surprising. no matter what the u.s. does to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, it will be dwarfed by what the rest of the world does. china, india and africa are not about to stop burning fossil fuels as they develop, and china is sprinting ahead to build huge new coal capacity despite its pledge to start reducing emissions after 2030. barring a breakthrough in battery or other technology, carbon emissions will continue to increase. no one knows how much the earth's temperature will warm, though even the u.n. model has modified its estimates from the apocalyptic predictions of some years ago. schumer-manchin will not reduce inflation, will not reduce the budget deficit, and it will not reduce the world's temperature. what it will do is transfer some $369 billion from taxpayers and drug companies to the pockets of green energy businesses and investors. it will tighten the hold that politicians have on the allocation of capital, as they pick winners and losers with their grants and tax credits. everyone will get a nice warm feeling as they pretend they are cooling the climate. mr. guthrie. this bill will not do what those on the floor today have said it will do. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from iowa (mrs. miller-meeks). mrs. miller-meeks. madam speaker, i thank representative guthrie for yielding me time. i rise today in opposition to h.r. 5376, the inflation reduction act. as a physician and former director of the iowa department of public health, i am uniquely positioned to understand the true implications of this bill and how this bill will affect both doctors and patients, and rural iowans are no exception. interestingly, i just heard my colleague talk about how families may be kicked off their healthcare, and it does not seem to me that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle cared about that when they passed the affordable care act and premiums rose dramatically. allowing the federal government to set limits on drug pricing will limit competition and drastically reduce innovation within the pharmaceutical industry. innovation also comes even after fda approval to determine if drugs can be used for more than just their initial purpose. additionally, narrowing the drug formulary by drug pricing through medicare and negotiations will end up taking medications that you may already be prescribed and taking successfully, taking them off of the formulary and not being covered. let me also illustrate, when medicare part d went into effect, the fact that there was not a negotiation by medicare allowed generic drugs as low as $4 a medication. that was tremendously helpful to millions of seniors and continues to this day. the united states is the leading developer of new drugs, but without market competition, american companies will lose the incentive to undergo cutting-edge research. what does that mean to the average person? it means fewer cures for rare diseases or debilitating diseases. fewer cures, less treatment for debilitating diseases. inevitably, the united states will become dependent on countries like china for pharmaceutical research and development, and patients will be limited in their options. did not we already see that through the pandemic? additionally, this bill will extend obamacare subsidies enacted in the american rescue plan, which do not have income restrictions. rather than helping those who are most in need, the wealthiest americans will continue to receive the largest average benefit. this enormous spending package is bad for iowans, bad for the economy, bad for hardworking americans, and bad for the future of american innovation. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california (ms. eshoo), who is the chair of our health subcommittee. ms. eshoo. madam speaker, i first thank the chairman of the energy and commerce committee, mr. pallone, for his leadership and all of my colleagues on the committee who have worked so hard. i think today is a hallelujah day, and i say this because two of the greatest challenges facing our country are the following. the climate crisis: this is the single largest investment to take on the climate crisis head-on. i hear from children as young as first graders in my district caring about this issue. two years ago this time, i had 77,000 evacuees from the wildfires in my congressional district. taking on the climate crisis is absolutely essential. seniors, the medicare beneficiaries, we are changing their prescription drug prices today because medicare will be able to directly negotiate and bring the prices down. cap insulin at $35 a month--senate republicans sabotaged that cap on insulin for all americans. i do not know how any politician can go home and brag about that. the out-of-pocket costs for medicare beneficiaries will not exceed $2,000 a year. we are investing in the irs. my constituents have been waiting for too [[page h7684]] long for their refunds. added staff is going to expedite the services that the irs and the american people need from the irs. finally, deficit reduction--yes, america, this is paid for. this is truly a hallelujah day. this is a red, white, and blue bill. it is good for all americans, and it will advance our collective future of america. ms. eshoo. madam speaker, our nation has major challenges that have kept me awake at night. the clarion call from young climate activists concerned they will not have a planet to grow old on. i have heard seniors describe their inability to afford their prescription drugs. today, we change all this by the largest and boldest effort to address climate change in american history. it honors our commitments under the paris agreement by investing $369 billion in tax credits, loans, and grants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030. for seniors, the inflation reduction act reduces prescription drug costs through policies developed by the health subcommittee i chair. over the past three years, we held six hearings focused on this challenge. the hearings brought forward the fact that our nation has been held back for 20 years by a law that prohibits medicare from negotiating directly with drug companies. not anymore. the bill also ensures medicare beneficiaries will not pay more than $2,000 annually for prescription drugs, and no more than $35 for insulin every month. this legislation also lowers health care premiums by strengthening the affordable care act to save an average of $800 per year for 13 million people. finally, the entire legislation is paid for by making billion-dollar companies pay their fair share and lowers the federal deficit by more than $300 billion. throughout my service in congress, my top priorities have been to grow our economy, make health care more affordable, and address climate change. today's transformative legislation meets these challenges, and i urge my colleagues to vote for it. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. castor), who chairs the select committee on the climate crisis. ms. castor of florida. madam speaker, as chair of the select committee on the climate crisis and as a mom, i am proud to say the inflation reduction act is a big climate deal. this is the largest investment in clean energy and climate solutions ever in u.s. history, and it comes at a crucial time. we must urgently slash climate pollution to avoid the worst impacts and to lower costs, create good-paying jobs, and build safer, more resilient communities. today, i am optimistic that america will lead the world in solving the climate crisis, and i thank the young people all across this country who pushed us to take this historic step. the inflation reduction act is also good news for floridians, as democrats will lower the costs of prescription drugs, empower medicare to negotiate drug prices, institute a $2,000 cap, and much more. it is a big deal for the 2.8 million floridians who purchase high- quality health coverage under the affordable care act. with these tax credits, those policies will be more affordable. yes, this is good news indeed, a true people over politics moment for all of our neighbors, their health, their pocketbooks, and the obligation we have to our kids to provide a livable planet. i thank speaker pelosi for her vision for the select committee on the climate crisis, and i also thank chairman frank pallone and my colleagues for their inspiring work. madam speaker, i urge a ``yes'' vote. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. this bill drives a massive build-out of unreliable wind and solar power, not nuclear, not natural gas, and not baseload power. i include in the record a report from the north american electric reliability corporation, the authority on electric reliability, which underscores the risk of blackouts from the oversupply of weather- dependent energy. [from north american electric reliability corporation, may 2022] 2022 summer reliability assessment key findings nerc's annual sra covers the upcoming four-month (june- september) summer period. this assessment provides an evaluation of generation resource and transmission system adequacy and energy sufficiency to meet projected summer peak demands and operating reserves this assessment identifies potential reliability issues of interest and regional topics of concern. while the scope of this seasonal assessment is focused on the upcoming summer, the key findings are consistent with risks and issues that nerc has highlighted in the 2021 long-term reliability assessment and other earlier reliability assessments and reports. the following findings are nerc and the ero enterprise's independent evaluation of electricity generation and transmission capacity and potential operational concerns that may need to be addressed for the 2022 summer. summer resource adequacy assessment and energy risk analysis midcontinent iso (miso) faces a capacity shortfall in its north and central areas, resulting in high risk of energy emergencies during peak summer conditions. capacity shortfall projections reported in the 2021 ltra and as far back as the 2018 ltra have continued load serving entities in 4 of 11 zones entered the annual planning resource auction (pra) in april 2022 without enough owned or contracted capacity to cover their requirements. across miso, peak demand projections have increased by 1.7 percent since last summer due in part to a return to normal demand patterns that have been altered in prior years by the pandemic. however, more impactful is the drop in capacity in the most recent pra: miso will have 3,200 mw (2.3 percent) less generation capacity than in the summer of 2021. system operators in miso are more likely to need operating mitigations, such as load modifying resources or non-firm imports, to meet reserve requirements under normal peak summer conditions. more extreme temperatures, higher generation outages, or low wind conditions expose the miso north and central areas to higher risk of temporary operator-initiated load shedding to maintain system reliability. at the start of the summer, a key transmission line connecting miso's northern and southern areas will be out of service. restoration continues on a 4-mile section of 500 kv transmission line that was damaged by a tornado during severe storms on december 10, 2021. the transmission outage affects 1,000 mw of firm transfers between the midwestern and southern miso system that includes parts of arkansas, louisiana, and mississippi. the transmission line is expected to be restored at the end of june 2022. anticipated resource capacity in saskatchewan will be strained to meet peak demand projections, which have risen by over 7.5 percent since 2021. saskpower is projected to remain above their planning reserve margin threshold and have sufficient operating reserves for normal peak conditions. however, external assistance is expected to be needed in extreme conditions that cause above-normal generator outages or demand. drought conditions create heightened reliability risk for the summer. drought exists or threatens wide areas of north america, resulting in unique challenges to area electricity supplies and potential impacts on demand: energy output from hydro generators throughout most of the western united states is being affected by widespread drought and below-normal snowpack. dry hydrological conditions threaten the availability of hydroelectricity for transfers throughout the western interconnection. some assessment areas, including wecc's california-mexico (ca/mx) and southwest reserve sharing group (srsg), depend on substantial electricity imports to meet demand on hot summer evenings and other times when variable energy resource (e.g., wind, solar) output is diminishing. in the event of wide-area extreme heat event, all u.s. assessment areas in the western interconnection are at risk of energy emergencies due to the limited supply of electricity available for transfer. extreme drought across much of texas can produce weather conditions that are favorable to prolonged, wide-area heat events and extreme peak electricity demand. resource additions to the ercot system in recent years-predominantly solar and some wind--have raised anticipated reserve margins above reference margin levels and ease concerns of capacity shortfalls for normal peak demand. however, extreme heat increases peak demand and can be accompanied by weather patterns that lead to increased forced outages or reduced energy output from resources of all types. a combination of extreme peak demand, low wind, and high outage rates from thermal generators could require system operators to use emergency procedures, up to and including temporary manual load shedding. as drought conditions continue over the missouri river basin, output from thermal generators that use the missouri river for cooling in southwest power pool (spp) may be affected in summer months. low water levels in the river can impact generators with once-through cooling and lead to reduced output capacity. energy output from hydro generators on the river can also be affected by drought conservation measures implemented in the reservoir system. outages and reduced output from thermal and hydro generation could lead to energy shortfalls at peak demand. periods of above normal wind [[page h7685]] generator output may give some relief, however, this energy is not assured. system operators could require emergency procedures to meet peak demand during periods of high generator unavailability. all other areas have sufficient resources to manage normal summer peak demand and are at low risk of energy shortfalls from more extreme demand or generation outage conditions. anticipated reserve margins meet or surpass the reference margin level, indicating that planned resources in these areas are adequate to manage the risk of a capacity deficiency under normal conditions. furthermore, based on risk scenario analysis in these areas, resources and energy appear adequate. other reliability issues for summer supply chain issues and commissioning challenges on new resource and transmission projects are a concern in areas where completion is needed for reliability during summer peak periods. assessment areas report that some generation and transmission projects are being impacted by product unavailability, shipping delays, and labor shortages. at the time of this assessment publication, wecc-ca/mx, and wecc- srsg have sizeable amounts of generation capacity in development and included in their resource projections for summer. in texas (ercot), transmission expansion projects are underway to alleviate transmission constraints and maintain system stability as the bps is adapted to rapid growth in new generation; delays or cancellations of transmission projects can cause transmission system congestion during peak conditions and affect the ability to serve load in localized areas. should project delays emerge, affected generator owners (gos) and transmission owners must communicate changes to balancing authorities (bas), transmission operators, and reliability coordinators, so that impacts are understood and steps are taken to reduce risks of capacity deficiencies or energy shortfalls. coal-fired gos are having difficulty obtaining fuel and non-fuel consumables as supply chains are stressed. no specific bps reliability impacts are currently foreseen; however, coal stockpiles at power plants are relatively low compared to historical levels. some owners and operators report challenges in arranging replenishment due to mine closures, rail shipping limitations, and increased coal exports. some gos have implemented controls to maintain sufficient stocks for peak months while bas and reliability coordinators are continuing to conduct fuel surveys and monitoring the situation. the electricity and other critical infrastructure sectors face cyber security threats from russia and other potential actors amid heightened geopolitical tensions in addition to ongoing cyber risks. russian attackers may be planning or attempting malicious cyber activity to gain access and disrupt the electric grid in north america in retaliation for support to ukraine. the electricity infrastructure sharing and analysis center (e-isac) continues to exchange information with its members and has posted communications and guidance from government partners and other advisories on its portal. e-isac members are encouraged to check in regularly to receive updates and to actively share information regarding threats and other malicious activities with the e-isac to enable broader communication with other sector participants and government partners. unexpected tripping of solar photovoltaic (pv) resources during grid disturbances continues to be a reliability concern. in may and june 2021, the texas interconnection experienced widespread solar pv loss events like those previously observed in the california area. similarly, four additional solar pv loss events occurred between june and august 2021 in california. mr. guthrie. this bill does not do what democrats say it will do. madam speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. scalise), the republican whip. mr. scalise. madam speaker, i thank my friend from kentucky (mr. guthrie) for yielding. i rise in strong opposition to this bill that will absolutely increase the deficit. it will absolutely increase inflation, and this bill will absolutely increase energy costs. in fact, they have a multibillion-dollar new tax on energy. i have not heard one person in america saying they want to pay more money for gasoline, yet they are putting billions in new taxes on energy, so you will not only be paying more for gasoline, but you will be paying more for utility bills for your household, which are already skyrocketing because of president biden and speaker pelosi's radical, far-left spending they have already done the last year and a half. but it does not end there. $250 billion in cuts to medicare drugs--that is right. for seniors, this bill cuts $250 billion out of medicare drug spending to help people in higher income brackets be eligible for more obamacare subsidies, so a massive wealth transfer away from seniors to higher- income people to get subsidies for obamacare. then let us talk about these 87,000 irs agents. you think of just about any nfl stadium in america filled completely with new irs agents. that is right, more than doubling the size of the irs to go after lower-income people. they love saying on the other side: do not worry. it is not going to touch them. there is only one problem: it does not stand up to the facts. there was an amendment in the senate, right here, very simple, a one- page amendment to protect people making under $400,000 from new audits by the irs. this amendment was voted down on a party-line vote because they want that army of 87,000 irs agents going after lower-income people. in fact, the smoking gun came out this morning. they do not have a full cbo report on this bill. you heard the old adage that you have to pass the bill to find out what is in it. that is what they are doing today. that is why they are rushing this bill through today. it does not even have a review from the congressional budget office. but just a few hours ago, we got this. it was a confirmation that the irs agents will be getting about $20 billion in new taxes from people making less than $400,000. that is right. the cbo just confirmed it a few hours ago. president biden made that promise multiple times: if you make under $400,000, do not worry; your taxes do not go up. this bill breaks president biden's promise. it is confirmed by the cbo. there was an amendment to stop it from happening, and every democrat voted against it. they would not allow us to bring that amendment here on the floor because they are ramming it through because they do not want people to know what is inside of this bill. $700-plus billion in new taxes--budget gimmicks that say, for the new taxes over 10 years, they are only going to account for 3 years of spending, which means if you account for the full 10 years, it increases the deficit. of course, during inflation times and this crisis we are facing economically, this bill will increase inflation and gas prices. let us reject the bill and go back to the drawing board. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from new york (ms. clarke), a member of the energy and commerce committee. ms. clarke of new york. madam speaker, i thank the chairman for yielding. i rise today in support of h.r. 5376, the inflation reduction act of 2022. this monumental generational investment in our nation's future will lower prescription drug prices and energy costs, extend healthcare coverage for millions of americans, and deliver a vital down payment of resources in our stand against the climate crisis, all while creating millions of well-paying jobs across america. moreover, it makes good on our promise to always fight for this country's most vulnerable communities, now and forever. the journey to today has been challenging, to say the least, but i am at long last elated to know that the change americans need and demand is finally here. thanks to the hard work and ceaseless resolve of president joe biden, my democratic colleagues on the senate side, and every individual who took seriously their duty to fight tooth and nail to better the lives of every american in our care, our pursuit of progress has never been stronger. for communities of color, our seniors, pregnant and postpartum people, individuals and families living on low wages, and everyone else who has long borne the brunt of too many hardships to list, this legislation represents the initial steps they have long and desperately awaited. {time} 1500 the inflation reduction act will prevent thousands of premature deaths by improving air quality in densely populated communities with high environmental justice needs. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. latta), a member of the committee on energy and commerce. [[page h7686]] mr. latta. madam speaker, i rise in opposition to h.r. 5367, a bill the democrats claim will reduce inflation when, in reality, it will do the exact opposite. american families are struggling to keep the lights on at home. far too many people in this country are worrying about the costs associated with putting food on their table and gas in their tanks. and yet, the majority has decided now is the time to double down on their tax-and- spend policies with american taxpayers footing the bill. it is also concerning that this bill promotes anti-american energy policies. it will put aside $250 billion at the department of energy to subsidize the rush to green energy. this is picking winners and losers in the energy market and will scare away investments in baseload power sources. american small businesses need access to more reliable energy, not less. if the grid becomes too reliant on intermittent green energy sources, we will begin to see manufacturers shutter their operations. although it is hard to see how this bill could be salvaged, i did offer an amendment to try to prevent this outcome. my amendment would have required the secretary of energy to certify that the bill would not negatively impact electric grid reliability before funding could be used. considering the devastating consequences that would result for american families and businesses, it makes perfect sense that the government should do its due diligence in examining all possible outcomes. unfortunately, the majority chose not to consider my amendment on the house floor today. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation because it will increase taxes on american families, institute price controls that will block innovation and medical cures, promote irresponsible spending on green new deal carve-outs and provide significant risks to the electric grid. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from oregon (mr. schrader), a member of the committee on energy and commerce. mr. schrader. madam speaker, i rise today in complete support of h.r. 5376, the inflation reduction act. during my time in congress, i have dedicated my service to improving our healthcare system and working to lower the cost of prescription drugs. i am ecstatic that the bill before us today includes my and representative peters drug price reduction framework that will finally rein in the cost of prescription drugs for our seniors and protect pharmaceutical innovation, contrary to what the other side will tell you. the medicare drug cost reductions will be transformative. the bill will allow medicare to finally negotiate drug prices and the practice of raising prices in the medicare program beyond the rising inflation and provide lasting financial relief to our most vulnerable seniors by establishing a $2,000 out-of-pocket maximum for spending on prescription drugs. the prescription drug cost portions of this bill will also preserve scientific creativity and the innovation ecosystem that has been essential to the domestic job-preserving development of life changing and lifesaving treatments and cures. and the close to $300 billion in deficit reduction from this portion of the bill will be huge for the overall viability of our troubled medicare system going forward. this will be the biggest improvement to medicare since the inception of part d almost 20 years ago. i am proud to have been a leading advocate to deliver relief on the high cost of prescription drugs. madam speaker, i thank my colleagues in both chambers who worked with me directly to get this across the finish line. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from florida (mr. bilirakis), my good friend. mr. bilirakis. madam speaker, i thank my good friend from the great state of kentucky as well. madam speaker, i rise today in strong opposition to the inflation, recession, irs army act. as the american people struggle to put food on their tables and gas in their cars, democrats bring us here today to raise americans' taxes and destabilize our prescription drug market. my colleagues across the aisle want everyone to believe that this bill will drive down the cost of drugs, but they fail to mention that this policy will severely stifle innovation, unfortunately. as a proud advocate for individuals suffering with cancer, rare diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as als, alzheimer's, and parkinson's, i am committed to seeing cures come to market. but policies like this one will heartlessly jeopardize the likelihood of these breakthroughs. i would like to see my democratic colleagues work with us on the productive policy solutions found in the lower costs, more cures act, which would drive down the cost of drugs for the american people but would not destroy the innovative research and development that is uniquely american. sadly, it seems more thought was put into targeting average americans with an irs army and over 1 million new audits than in helping them find cures for their life-threatening ailments, unfortunately. floridians deserve better. and the american people deserve better than this bogus piece of legislation that will raise taxes and reduce the number of cures and treatments coming to market. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from michigan (mrs. dingell), a member from the committee on energy and commerce. mrs. dingell. madam speaker, i rise in strong support of the inflation reduction act. this landmark package is finally on the house floor after over a year of hard work and rolling up our sleeves. this bill will serve all americans by bringing down energy and health costs, reversing inflation, reducing the deficit, cleaning up our environment, and sparking a new, clean energy economy. it is responsibly paid for, and middle-class families will not see any increased taxes. this is a defining moment for tackling the climate crisis. this bold legislation represents the single largest investment in clean energy, environmental justice, and climate actions in american history, including the greenhouse gas reduction fund and increased investments in both the atvm loan program, and the domestic manufacturing conversion grant program, based on legislation i helped write. the automotive industry is fully committed to going electric. while this legislation may pose some challenges in the short term, it will strengthen the long-term trajectory of the automotive industry, our domestic supply chains, and american manufacturing. it is bringing jobs home, strengthening our supply chain, and reducing our dependency on foreign manufacturing. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. johnson), my good friend, mr. johnson of ohio. madam speaker, i rise today to highlight my amendment that the minority refuses to even bring to a vote. my amendment is simple. it would amend this so-called inflation reduction act by striking from the bill the methane emissions reduction program, which is a fancy term for what could be more accurately described as attacks on american natural gas. in my district in eastern and southeastern ohio, oil and gas workers get up every day to produce our valuable natural resources that are used to generate electricity, power manufacturing, heat and cool our homes, cook our food, and more recently, to use our american natural gas to rescue our european allies who now find themselves under vladimir putin's tyrannical thumb. this methane tax jeopardizes all of this, and it represents yet another attack by the majority on american fossil fuels that have brought more people out of poverty around the world than any other energy source around the planet. when i talk to producers in my district, i give them a lot of credit. these companies, without being asked, are quite literally innovating every day. they use state-of-the-art technology to capture as much of their methane [[page h7687]] emissions as possible, and they are proud to do it. and what is their reward? well, they get a new tax anyway. it is also worth noting that the epa is already working on rulemaking for regulating methane emissions, and the authors of this bill knew that-- all to appease the radical environmentalist left. madam speaker, i want to be clear that this is not, ``a methane reduction program.'' it is a massive tax on american producers, american businesses, and american workers. it is a tax on job creators in ohio. it is a tax on hardworking americans trying to heat and cool our homes, and a tax on feeding our families, and a tax on the american way of life. we should strike this provision from the bill. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from minnesota (ms. craig), a member of the committee on energy and commerce. ms. craig. madam speaker, today is the day that we deliver on many of our promises to the american people. we are going to lower the cost of healthcare for millions of americans. we are going to invest in american energy independence and reduce carbon emissions. we are going to do this in a responsible way, as we reduce the deficit in the process. the inflation reduction act takes historic strides to make healthcare more affordable by capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month for those on medicare. capping out-of-pocket drug costs for our nation's seniors at $2,000 a year, and empowering medicare to negotiate drug prices for our seniors. we also extend the aca tax credit, ensuring that we continue along the path of these historic rates of uninsured in our nation. we are going to make the largest investment in clean energy in our nation's history, reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent this decade, and invest in biofuels infrastructure for minnesota's family farmers. madam speaker, i say to my colleagues, today, the will of our constituents will prevail over special interests--at least on this side of the aisle. madam speaker, this legislation will make a real difference in reducing costs for working families. i am proud to support it, and i encourage my colleagues to do the same. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from washington state (ms. schrier). ms. schrier. madam speaker, i am so excited to vote today for this climate and healthcare bill, and here is why: this bill is the answer to the questions that my constituents have been asking since day one. here is what i am hearing: dr. schrier, you have diabetes, too. i cannot afford my insulin. i am having to ration at the end of the month. will not you do something about it? well, here is the answer: $35-a-month insulin. dr. schrier, i am a senior. i have a fixed income. i cannot afford these high drug prices. why cannot medicare negotiate them? well, here is your answer: medicare getting the power to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs. also: dr. schrier, i am a senior. there are too many out-of-pocket costs for me. this caps them at $2,000. and finally, right now, we have fires burning in washington state. and i have farmers who have seen reduced crop yields because of extreme heat. they say: dr. schrier, cannot you do something about climate? and here is the answer: the biggest investment in climate solutions that we have ever had. this bill brings relief. it brings financial relief to families who are feeling the high inflation in gas prices. and you know how it does it? by finally making sure that the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share of taxes, and it does it without raising tax on middle-class families. madam speaker, i am so excited about this bill because it answers the requests of the people i represent, and that is why i am so excited to vote for it today. {time} 1515 mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. pfluger). mr. pfluger. madam speaker, i rise to speak against this so-called inflation reduction act, a piece of legislation that weakens america, weakens our businesses, increases the cost of energy for all americans and our families, and funds a new 87,000-person army of irs agents that are coming after low- and middle-income families. here is a pretty good rule of thumb for this legislation. if you are one of biden's chosen green new deal companies, you are probably going to get a handout from american taxpayers. but for small, independent american energy producers in districts like mine, the permian basin, your reward for keeping the lights on is a new, poorly conceived natural gas tax that will raise the cost of everything and give china an edge on our american manufacturers. in fact, i offered an amendment to strike this provision, but democrats voted it down in the rules committee, voting against u.s. energy and voting for foreign energy. the democrat response is tax credits for the rich, a slush fund for loans to their favorite green companies, and more regulatory red tape to drive up energy costs for all of us. families have to decide whether to fill up their tanks or to pay for everyday essentials at grocery stores because of high gas prices due to president biden's policies. the crowning achievement of this legislation will not be inflation reduction. it will be making america more dependent on our adversaries, more dependent on our adversaries for energy, dependent on china for medical manufacturing and supply chain issues, and dependent on china for critical minerals. if the democrats' goal is to reduce baseload, reliable power sources and increase our dependency on foreign nations, they are succeeding. if their goal is to create regulatory red tape to drive up energy costs for main street businesses and families, once again, they are succeeding. if their goal is to help american families and small businesses, this piece of legislation is a fail. america asked for relief, and instead, democrats will deliver new and higher taxes that will be enforced by an 87,000-person irs army. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to vote for america and against this bill. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from texas (mrs. fletcher), a member of the energy and commerce committee. mrs. fletcher. madam speaker, today is a historic day. today, we will vote on the question of whether to allow medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs and cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors; lower the cost of healthcare; implement smart energy policy to reduce emissions, fight climate change, and spur energy innovation; invest in american manufacturing; and reduce our deficit spending by $300 billion. we answer these questions ``yes'' by voting for the inflation reduction act. as the representative of the energy capital of the world, where we lead in energy technology and investment, i want to respond to some of the things that we have just heard. i am particularly proud of the work that we have done here to ensure that the historic methane emissions reduction program will actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make it possible for energy companies of all sizes to reduce their emissions through a grant program, and ensure that the united states remains the global leader in energy production and in energy innovation and technology. we do this by voting together for this historic bill today. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. garamendi). mr. garamendi. madam speaker, the historic inflation reduction act lowers everyday costs americans are struggling to afford by cutting the price of prescription drugs, by making the largest-ever investment in climate action, and by reducing inflation--all of this without raising taxes on middle-class americans and also paying down the national debt. for too long, the price of lifesaving prescription drugs has bankrupted [[page h7688]] american families. no more. this bill caps out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 and allows medicare finally to directly negotiate the price of drugs. similarly, we must address the increasing costs americans are bearing at the hands of climate change. this bill's $369 billion investment in climate action will unleash a renaissance in clean energy technology, creating millions of new, high-paying manufacturing jobs, and build the next generation of american energy and transportation. madam speaker, i support this legislation, and i call upon my colleagues, democrats and republicans, to pass this legislation. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i include in the record a bloomberg news story reporting how power costs are already forcing u.s. factories to shut down, featuring an aluminum mill in my district, in hawesville, kentucky. this underscores the risk to our nation's competitiveness that these policies bring about, and this bill will not do what those on the floor say that it will do. [from bloomberg news, july 7, 2022] the us industrial complex is starting to buckle from high power costs (by joe deaux and naureen s malik) it was only a matter of time, really. europe's fertilizer plants, steel mills, and chemical manufacturers were the first to succumb. massive paper mills, soybean processors, and electronics factories in asia went dark. now soaring natural gas and electricity prices are starting to hit the us industrial complex. on june 22, 600 workers at the second-largest aluminum mill in america, accounting for 20 percent of us supply, learned they were losing their jobs because the plant cannot afford an electricity tab that is tripled in a matter of months. century aluminum co. says it will idle the hawesville, kentucky, mill for as long as a year, taking out the biggest of its three us sites. a shutdown like this can take a month as workers carefully swirl the molten metal into storage so it does not solidify in pipes and vessels and turn the entire facility into a useless brick. restarting takes another six to nine months. for this reason, owners do not halt operations unless they have exhausted all other options. it is the most poignant signal yet of what is to come-but not the only one. at least two steel mills have begun suspending some operations to cut energy costs, according to one industry executive, who asked not to be identified because the information is not public. in may, a group of factories across the us midwest warned federal energy regulators that some were on the verge of closing for the summer or longer because of what they described as ``unjust and unreasonable'' electricity costs. they asked to be wholly absolved of some power fees-a request that, if granted, would be unprecedented. it is no wonder. by the beginning of june, natural gas prices had tripled what they were a year earlier, threatening households and businesses alike with some of the biggest utility bills they have ever seen. this summer, electricity rates for industrial customers are set to hit their highest levels ever, based on us government forecasts. because us plants and factories depend on both electricity and gas, this could very well be the moment the rug's pulled out from under american industry. manufacturing overtime hours have already declined for three straight months, the longest downward stretch since 2015, and a measure of us manufacturing activity weakened in june to a two-year low as new orders contracted. a week after century's announcement, the nation's largest aluminum producer alcoa corp. said it is closing a third of its production at a mill in indiana because of ``operational challenges.'' these headwinds could eventually threaten what some see as a longer-term boom in us manufacturing as corporations look to reduce their dependence on china. executives are highlighting plans to relocate production at a greater clip this year than they even did in the first six months of the pandemic, but energy and labor costs will pose challenges for any company looking to build a new operation in the us. manufacturing is not the bellwether of the us economy it once was. the plants that 70 years ago employed more than a third of the nation's labor force now account for about 8 percent of nonfarm workers. an industrial downturn on its own will not tip us into a recession, but it could if combined with weakness in other sectors. while the might of american industry has significantly weakened over the years, it still accounts for more than a tenth of us gross domestic product- and for that reason holds an outsize place in the hearts of politicians whose factory visits are a perennial staple of campaigns. plants will try to operate more efficiently to lower their utility bills, but there are limits to how much they can save. in a lot of regions, industrial users are not just paying for the power they use; they are also paying for what is known as capacity, essentially an insurance policy that keeps enough power on the grid for the most extreme of demand days. (think hot summer days when everyone's air conditioners are blasting.) and with wholesale energy prices near the highest levels since 2008 and aging power plants shutting, those insurance premiums are growing exponentially, particularly in the middle of the country where much of the country's industrial operations lie. one potential bright spot, or an indication of how desperate industrial companies are becoming: some are partnering with startups to explore alternative energy sources: nature energy says it expects to start building facilities this year to collect and convert cow dung and crop waste into renewable natural gas. power edison, which is proposing to stack massive batteries on barges that can be shipped around to customers in need, is attracting more attention. as katie coleman, an attorney for texas association of manufacturers, puts it, her members have three big cost drivers: taxes, electricity, and labor. those three vary in proportion over time, she says, ``but right now, electricity is an even larger factor than normal.'' some companies with multiple factories are trying to decide which plants to keep running this summer based on how cheap they can get their electricity, she says, and some may decide which to permanently close. such is the case for century, which will keep operations running in iceland where power is incredibly cheap because of local renewable energy resources. there is a lot to blame for this year's surge in us energy prices: russia's invasion of ukraine; the ensuing surge in us natural gas exports to markets overseas; extreme weather brought on by climate change; aging fossil-fuel-fired power plants retiring at a record pace. they are all coinciding with a sharp rebound in post-pandemic demand. one group of manufacturers will say they told us so. the industrial energy consumers of america has been calling on the biden administration for months to limit the amount of gas us energy suppliers send overseas, warning that exports would eventually lead to supply shortages at home. but a measure like that would set a dangerous precedent and threaten the billions of dollar of investments in liquefied natural gas terminals along us shores. shipments overseas have so far remained unfettered. how severe of an industrial downturn we are heading into depends on a lot of variables -chief among them being how long energy prices remain high. milder weather, fewer power plant disruptions, and more solar and wind farm deployments could shift the natural gas market back into an era of lower prices and improve the fortunes of manufacturers. today, we are far from that. michael harris, whose firm unified energy services llc buys fuel for industrial clients, says costs have risen so high that some are having to put millions of dollars of credit on the line to secure power and gas contracts. ``that can be devastating for a corporation,'' he says. ``i do not see any scenario, absent explosions at us lng facilities'' that trap supplies at home, in which gas prices are headed lower in the long term. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. carter). mr. carter of georgia. madam speaker, i rise today in strong opposition to the inflation expansion act, which includes deeply troubling proposals that will kneecap medical innovation and harm patients' access to cures. madam speaker, for 40 years, i was behind the counter. i was the one who had to tell the patient how much their prescription was going to be. i was the one who witnessed the senior citizens trying to make a decision between buying their medication or buying their groceries. i was the one who had to tell the mother how much the antibiotic was going to be and see her in tears trying to find the money to pay for that antibiotic. i know all too well about prescription drug prices. today, i am behind the podium as my democratic colleagues decide whether to mortgage those same patients' health and well-being for a political win. this is immoral, and it must be stopped. the united states leads the world in medical innovation. i have watched it, and i have seen it as terminal illnesses became treatable with a simple pill. i have seen the relief on a patient's face when they heard that a new treatment is available for their once incurable disease. this bill eradicates hope. madam speaker, we need to help lower drug prices and costs for patients, but this legislation goes about it in all the wrong ways. pharmaceutical companies are the drivers of innovation that deliver lifesaving cures to patients. however, this legislation will result in dozens, possibly hundreds, of fewer cures over the next decade. i tried to fix this self-imposed problem in the rules committee on wednesday, but it was rejected. i also introduced an amendment to block the [[page h7689]] federal government from funding radical green lobbying groups, but that was rejected. there is no excuse for the federal government to steal billions of dollars from taxpayers, including $1.5 billion in funding for tree equity, while inflation sits at a 40-year high. medical professionals are sworn to do no harm. it is time congress took the same oath and quit our assault on taxpayers and mostly on patients. madam speaker, i urge a ``no'' vote. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from maryland (mr. mfume). mr. mfume. madam speaker, this is really about people over politics today, and i am glad that people all over the country are watching and listening to this debate. it is not about the wealthy, the well-connected, and the well-off. it is about people who believe, like many of us, that we have gone too far without lowering the cost of medicine for everyday people by reducing and capping costs where they are--the $35 cap on insulin--and finding a way to close the real gap that exists in terms of affordable care and extension of the subsidies and making sure that we are really tackling the climate crisis by providing the things that will allow consumers and homeowners to do what they need to find a way to take advantage of the tax subsidies. most of all, it says to everyone else that this is completely paid for. this is not a tax bill. it is paid for. it is paid for by making sure that the wealthiest and corporations that really get out of paying taxes do not get out of paying taxes anymore. it is not about the wealthy, the well-connected, and the well-off. it is about people all over this country, in baltimore and elsewhere, who want and need this legislation. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from indiana (mr. mrvan). mr. mrvan. madam speaker, i rise today in support of the inflation reduction act, the historic measure that takes action to lower costs for individuals and families in northwest indiana and throughout our nation. of particular importance to me are the provisions that finally address the unfair disadvantage our seniors face when deciding between missing a meal or missing a prescription drug. as a local elected official, i sat at the table with individuals making those choices, and we were able to find solutions. i appreciate more than anything that, under this legislation, medicare will negotiate certain prescription drug prices, limit out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 per month, and, for the first time ever, cap medicare part d out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000. it is to the seniors' advantage to have this passed. this is real progress that provides real relief to seniors, and i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical legislation. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. balderson). mr. balderson. madam speaker, i rise in opposition to h.r. 5376. today, we are voting on a bill that achieves the exact opposite of what its name implies. here is what is in their $745 billion inflation reduction plan. it raises taxes on businesses in the midst of a recession. it forces us into a socialist drug-pricing scheme, leading to fewer lifesaving cures, higher costs, and less hope. it hires 87,000 more irs agents to spy on you. it makes it more expensive to heat your home with a new tax on american natural gas. it wastes $27 billion on the epa climate bank charged with handing out all of your tax dollars to woke energy corporations. they are throwing your hard-earned money at their green new deal dreams while carrying out their misguided threats to eliminate fossil fuels. just look at europe's energy crisis to see the true cost of the rush-to-green agenda. rather than unleashing america's abundant energy resources, this legislation raises taxes on energy production and imposes restrictions on local producers in my district and in ohio. instead of helping bring down prices at the pump for hardworking americans, this bill gives away $7,500 tax credits for the wealthy to buy and upgrade their electric vehicles. what does all of this mean for ohioans? higher prices, energy insecurity, and tax hikes. madam speaker, this bill only makes matters worse. i urge a ``no'' vote on h.r. 5376. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. kim). mr. kim of new jersey. madam speaker, in 2018, i was at a home in a retirement community along the jersey shore. a gentleman pulled me aside and, in a whispered voice, shared with me that he pays over $500 a month for prescription drugs and could not keep up. he resorted to halving his pills. he told me he was a proud man, but i could hear a quiver in his voice because he felt bad that he could not provide for himself and his wife. he said he worked hard for his entire life, but he cannot do this on his own. i told him that it was not his fault, that prices had been skyrocketing, that medicare had not been able to negotiate prices, and that here in the richest, most powerful nation in the world, those who worked hard over the course of their lives are left to fend for themselves, halving their medication. how sad is that? i come to the floor of the house today to say that this stops here. medicare will be able to negotiate, and because of that gentleman and many others i heard from, i decided to help author the provision to cap the out-of-pocket costs for seniors at $2,000 a year, which is about $166 a month. seniors have been waiting too long, and it is time now to get this done. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. madam speaker, may i inquire how much time is remaining on both sides. the speaker pro tempore (ms. houlahan). the gentleman from new jersey has 5 minutes remaining. the gentleman from kentucky has 4 minutes remaining. {time} 1530 mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ohio (mr. ryan). mr. ryan. madam speaker, this is an american bill--apple pie; mom; baseball; and red, white, and blue. this is for the exhausted majority of the people in this country: democrats, republicans, and independents versus the extremists. madam speaker, if you think that this town has been spending too much money and we need to reduce the deficit, we do that by hundreds of billions of dollars. if you think seniors are taking it on the chin, we help them with prescription drugs and $35 insulin payments. if you think we need to increase the production of natural gas, that is in this bill to create jobs here, lower costs here, and export to europe and the rest of the world to knock putin's knees out from under him. the most exciting thing in this bill is we double down on finally having an industrial policy in this country to out-compete china. we are going to build things. on top of the infrastructure bill and the chips act, we are going to build electric vehicles, electric cars, and electric tractors. with batteries, solar, and wind, we are going to rebuild the middle class. while the other side wants to defund the fbi, we want to fund our kids' future here in the united states. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, there is nothing in the bill that increases our production of natural gas. the methane emissions reduction program is a natural gas tax that will impact the entire economy. the natural gas tax will make everything more expensive for american families. the natural gas tax will increase the price of fuel, fertilizer, and food. madam speaker, 180 million americans use natural gas to heat homes and run appliances. about 5\1/2\ million businesses use it to run their workplaces and manufacturing facilities. this bill will give epa sweeping authority to expand the natural gas tax to other sectors, including agriculture. there are no guardrails to prevent the epa from ratcheting up the natural gas tax in years ahead. [[page h7690]] madam speaker, i yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from the state of tennessee (mrs. harshbarger). mrs. harshbarger. madam speaker, i rise today in opposition to the far-left inflation expansion act. this bill is detrimental to americans' wallets and their ability just to keep their heads above water. this bill is littered with economy- crushing measures that cater to climate extremists and socialists. this tax will impact every single part of our lives. it will be more expensive to heat our homes, to buy basic necessities, and it will even de-incentivize manufacturing of thousands upon thousands of goods that we use every day. this bill is chock-full of green new deal slush funds with no accountability and no transparency. we cannot afford to pour billions that we do not have into programs that cut our gas and oil industry off at the knees--an industry that is already suffering greatly under the biden administration. this attack on our refineries could lead to even higher gas prices. i know that is hard to believe, but it is true. it leaves us exposed and more reliant on our enemies. this bill is problematic from start to finish, but as a licensed pharmacist for over 30 years, the most concerning part of this socialist scheme is that the government will now have authority to set pricing on lifesaving medication. and when they set the price, it is going to be out of the reach of the americans who need it the most. the tip of the day is you never want the government in control of pricing anything. this act will directly take away hope from seniors and as many as 100-plus cures will be in jeopardy. there will be no incentive for companies to develop cures for rare and ultra-rare diseases. this bill encourages drug companies to spend less on research and development and more on navigating the politics of it all. americans are already being forced to choose between purchasing groceries or purchasing their prescriptions, and the last thing anyone needs is higher prices for prescriptions and rising insurance premiums. members on the other side of the aisle continue to push an agenda that america does not want. this bill is horrendous. it is an abomination that democrats would go to such lengths--as far as risking the health and the safety of the people they swore an oath to represent--just to push their radical liberal agenda. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to consider the lives that will be negatively impacted by this radical bill and hope to see all the members of the house of representatives make the right decision for america with a ``no'' vote on this far-left inflation expansion act. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield myself 1 minute. madam speaker, i just want to take this opportunity to thank my committee staff who worked so hard on this legislation for so many years. this day would not be possible if it was not for their dedication and constant perseverance: tiffany guarascio, waverly gordon, rick kessler, una lee, jacquelyn bolen, saha khaterzai, rick van buren, tuley wright, caitlin haberman, adam fischer, anthony gutierrez, tyler o'connor, medha surampudy, jacqueline cohen, dustin maghamfar, timia crisp, and brendan larkin. let me just say, madam speaker, i am still waiting for a couple more speakers. i just want to say that i cannot emphasize enough the significance of this legislation in terms of reducing costs for seniors through negotiated prices for medicare, extending the affordable care act, which has made so many people have health insurance who did not have it before, and also addressing climate change, which is really the greatest crisis of our time. there is nothing that could be more significant in this legislation. madam speaker, i would inquire how much time is remaining. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from new jersey has 3 minutes remaining. the gentleman from kentucky has 1 minute remaining. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. guthrie. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. mccarthy), who is one of my good friends here in congress, a great leader, and the republican leader in the house of representatives. mr. mccarthy. madam speaker, today feels like a little deja vu. it feels like we are sitting back--was it february of last year? america is on a brink. the world is warning the majority party if they follow through with more of their spending they could create inflation in america. it was not just on our side of the aisle that warned you. no. the former secretary of the treasury warned you that if you went through with that $2 trillion that inflation would rise and america would be harmed. but nobody listened on the other side. they were proud. they were going to cheer. they were going to get elected. they were going to win based upon this. they went ahead and they passed that bill with one-party control in the house and in the senate, and the president signed it. if you listened to steve rattner, a democratic adviser to obama, he called it the original sin of inflation. listen to the american public. madam speaker, i hope every single member asks their constituents: could they give 1 month's salary up? could they afford to give a month's salary up? i would love it, madam speaker, if the members would come back and tell me anyone who says ``yes'' to that. but the sad part about it, madam speaker, is everybody in america who is paid on a salary just lost more than 1 month because it was deja vu all over again. it was exactly that vote that took more than 1 month's salary from every american that is paid monthly. we have got a president, madam speaker, who thinks that inflation is zero. i guess that is why we are back to where we are again. today the people's house should be working to answer our country's call to address the rising prices of gas, groceries, and just about anything else that americans buy. i have not heard one debate on this floor today about how we are going to lower the gasoline price. i am not sure, but i guess, madam speaker, on the democratic side they think if they raise taxes then somehow that will make the price go down and not up. they have been proven to be wrong. instead, madam speaker, moments from now we will take up this misguided, tone-deaf bill. i believe it is the largest tone-deaf bill i have ever seen in this chamber in 232 years. democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people's money regardless of what we as a country can afford. madam speaker, i almost see glee in their eyes. i know there are not a lot of them here because they can vote by proxy. it is the only chamber in the history of america that has ever allowed that--not even on the senate side, not even during war, and not even during plague, but this body has, and this body continued it. they just extended it. this bill was not debated here. it was not talked about. but a lot of people are going to phone it in. they started this congress with trillions in wasteful spending that caused runaway inflation. their answer was to blame everybody else. now, their answer is just to deny there is inflation and just say it is zero. but today, now they are choosing to end the session by spending half a trillion dollars more of your money, raising taxes on the middle class, and giving hand-outs to their liberal allies. madam speaker, unlike most of the democrats, i have read this bill past the title. the facts about this bill are just astonishing. it sends $27 billion to a fraudulent national climate bank. put that in perspective: that is triple the size of the epa's current annual budget. madam speaker, as i go across the country i look to the gas stations and see people cry about how much it is costing them. you chose to raise it higher but not to give relief to the american public by lowering the gas price. along with that slush fund, it hands out tax credits like candy with no accountability. but when it comes to natural gas, which heats our homes and cooks our food, it raises taxes to fund their socialist scams. madam speaker, your energy prices will now go through the roof. [[page h7691]] madam speaker, i look forward to hearing how every democrat who votes for this bill--be it in person or how they phone it in by proxy-- explain it to their constituents this winter when they are making a choice about whether they pay the energy to heat their homes or they cut back on the gas to fill their tank or they no longer even buy the food at the grocery store because it just comes too high, they have to change. madam speaker, as they continue to raise trillions after trillions, when everybody warns them what they do is wrong, they do not care. they just want to double down on the mistakes they have already made. do not expect drug prices to come down either. this bill would cut treatments and hinder new cures by giving bureaucrats the power to decide what drugs seniors can access. it reduces your options and raises your costs. that is okay because that is their philosophy. they know best. just like they knew best when they thought $2 trillion would help. they called it the american rescue plan. you now have time to see what you have done. explain to me in the american rescue plan when it raised inflation and that took 1 month's salary from the american public, what did it rescue? {time} 1545 who did it help? answer me this question: is america better off today than they were 2 years ago? is the price of gasoline lower? it is? the price of gasoline is lower today than it was 2 years ago? i guess you believe inflation is zero, too. i am not quite sure about your math. is grocery lower than it was 2 years ago? are the car prices lower than it was 2 years ago? are your food prices? i would love a natural debate right here. why do not we have that? because the american people are having a challenge. you know, one of the most successful businesses in america is walmart. when walmart wants to look at where the economy is in america, they do not go hire economists. you know what they do? they just check the data of americans and what they buy. and for those who answered yes, you ought to study it, too. you know what? they just look at four products. they look at hamburger buns, hotdog buns, whole wheat, and white bread. and you know what? if the hamburger buns sales go down and the hot dog buns sales go down and the whole wheat sales go down, but the white bread sales go up, you are in an economic crisis. you know why? because people no longer can make the decision to have hamburgers with hamburger buns. they have to put the white bread there. for all of you who said yes, why do not you get out of washington for a moment and go ask your constituents if they are better off today than they were 2 years ago; because no, gas is not lower. gas is higher. and no, the car prices are higher, and their food prices are higher, and they are going up each and every day. i cannot believe you would say yes. you probably believe the american rescue plan was a good bill. you probably believe it is putin's fault, too. passing this bill today means more expensive bills for americans tomorrow, and everyone who says otherwise is not telling the truth. but of all the bad parts of this 700-page bill, the massive expansion of the irs is the most chilling. madam speaker, i wonder if we could ask the same question and, oh, boy, i imagine america will ask that in just roughly 87 more days. they will not just ask it, they will answer the question, even if it is not asked; if they are better off than they were 2 years ago. but they will probably ask the question: is america better off with 87,000 more irs agents? currently, the irs has almost 80,000 employees. so you are going to smile; you are going to vote for it. a lot of you are going to mail it in because you are just going to vote by proxy. you are going to pass a bill you never debated by people voting by proxy. you are going to double the size of the irs. they have 80,000 employees. you know what the irs also has? 4,600 guns, 5 million rounds of ammunition. why? democrats want to double its already massive size. you are going to spend $80 billion of hard-earned american taxpayer money to hire an army of 87,000 new irs agents. why would you even propose that? because you say, oh, it pays for the bill. madam speaker, i have got plenty of time. i think i will. i appreciate the encouragement because i think america needs the encouragement, because you know what? america actually needs a plan that works. why, if you passed an american rescue plan that caused inflation that we have not seen in 41 years--why, if you went after the fossil fuel of america that raised the price of gasoline that americans have not seen before--why do you keep harming the american public? and you think doing the exact same thing is your answer to save it? but while this bill doubles the number of irs personnel, it does not expand due process protections for the american people. worse, it includes no income floor for who can be audited. some of the same people on the other side of the aisle, madam speaker, who say we are better off than we were 2 years ago, that somehow--i do not know where they get their gas, but they said their gas price is lower. let me know, because i need to fill my tank up. so when you say that you are not going to go after every american to audit, you are not being honest, just like you are not being honest about what you did to cause the pain to this country. and you have no plan to solve it. you simply double down to the exact same thing you did before. based upon the past numbers, we know this would mean 710,000 new audits for people who make under $75,000. so someone who makes under $75,000, you think they need to pay for this. so what you are going to do is not trust them. madam speaker, you say you do not trust the american public, but you are not going to hire all these people for the irs so they could be there to help people fill out their tax returns. no, these people are going to audit them. we are going to double the size, and they are going to go after you. you see, there is a philosophy here, madam speaker. one side of this aisle believes in the american people. one side thinks they know best. even when the gas prices have risen, you think it is lower. i am sorry to tell you, madam speaker, the president even admitted the gas price is higher, but he thought it was a good thing. it was a good thing. because you think everybody can go out and buy a new car. well, we are going to audit you because we need to go after you because we think you are not fair, you are not honest, and we are going to make you pay for something else. just pay for the things we care most about. it costs individuals thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees and compliance costs just to be audited by the irs. imagine what you would do with an extra $10,000 a year. imagine how much better you could have used it than the federal government. and somehow you think it is best. you think it is best. that is how democrats pay for their pet projects. your pocketbook is their plan to fund more inflationary spending. this is just a train wreck just waiting to happen. and with this new power, the irs will snoop around in your bank account, in your venmo, your small business, and then the government will shake you down for every last cent. you know, in light of this week's events, let me ask: do you really trust this administration, the irs, to be fair, to not abuse their power? i hope that i am wrong, but history does not lie. madam speaker, as i travel the country, a lot of people know different names of people who work at the irs, lois lerner, and others. and even when it comes to light, government is powerful, government is big, government can take, as you have proven. you have taken so much from the american public. but now you want to intimidate them. i have watched democrats weaponize the government before, and i do not trust them now. madam speaker, mark my words. long after the headlines of this week [[page h7692]] fade, we will look back on this very day and on this bill as the one that broke the camel's back. i am sure, madam speaker, as the months progress, there will be new blame, there will be new problems. it will be those who own the gas station. you will probably blame the small families that had to buy the natural gas for their price going higher. somehow you will blame putin again, and somehow you will tell the american public, no, your price is not higher; you are actually better off, there is zero inflation, even though you take home less and everything costs more. let me tell you about the future the democrats want for america, the future that we can expect if this bill passes, much like the one before. when wealthy americans are getting tax breaks to buy luxury cars but you cannot afford to even fill up your tank, blame this bill, blame the democrats. when store shelves are empty because more american manufacturers have gone under, blame this bill, blame the democrats. when government agents are knocking at your door and threatening your business, blame this bill, blame the democrats. and when your loved ones are left without the cures they need to fight a rare disease, blame this bill, and blame the democrats. my friends, that is the exact choice for us today. now, i know a few democrats showed up. and, hopefully, all those who are voting by proxy are watching on tv, because they must be home sick, because that is what they said. i hope they spent the time to read it. i do not know if they read the american rescue plan, but they know the damage they have done. america feels it each and every day. madam speaker, i guess the next question would be--it will be interesting to hear the answer from the other side. if you think gas is cheaper than it was 2 years ago, if you think the prices at the grocery store are lower than it was 2 years ago, do you think the border is more secure than it was 2 years ago? someone said yes. madam speaker, i am going to introduce a bill to rename this place fantasyland. i hope when you go home, i hope you take the smirks off, and i hope you actually read your obituaries because fentanyl has now become the number one killer of americans between the ages of 18 and 45. it is not something to smirk about. i am sure you got power; you are in the majority. but you abuse the power, madam speaker. when you abuse power like that, people die. every walk of life, we are seeing it day in and day out. i remember the headline of six college kids down in florida this summer. they were not in a fraternity. they were not in a sorority. they were in the military academy. six of them od'd. four of them took the drug; two did not. two simply gave them mouth to mouth. you think it is important to double the size of the irs, but you are not going to do one thing for the border? i remember right after you took the power, you took over the house, the senate, and the white house, and you decided to change the policies. we watched what has come across the border. i took a trip down there. i remember going, talking to the agents. they were telling me they have never seen anything like this before. i said: what do you mean? they said: we are catching people on the terrorist watch list. i said: what? on the terrorist watch list? really? i did not know there was that many people on the terrorist watch list just from the triangle of central america. no, no, no, no, no. we are catching them from yemen. people come from 160 different countries across this border now. they bring their fentanyl from china. i went and did a press conference, and i talked about that. madam speaker, i thought people from both sides of the aisle would be very concerned about hearing people on the terrorist watch list are coming into america, knowing what has happened in this country before, and we would want to keep it safe. i was shocked. they did not ask me for more information. they just simply called me a liar. {time} 1600 we provided the proof. nobody apologized. that is okay. you do not need to apologize, but i wish you would do something about it. they continued to stay silent. then they fought to even get more information. but i fear to tell you that that is happening each and every day. there is not one new piece of money in here to secure that any more. that will stop as colleges open back up and as college students on the weekend go to their snapchat, think they are buying a xanax, and they do not wake up the next morning. but that is okay because you just gave a break to one of your big donors who makes a lot of money and is going to buy an electric car. it is okay because you feel good about what you are going to do. i guess that is why you do not show up to vote; you just vote by proxy. a vote for this bill is a vote to help the well-connected get further and further ahead while leaving needs of hard-working american families behind. yet, you could be forgiven for not understanding the gravity of today's vote. for such a supposedly historic occasion, few democrats even bothered to show up. look around this chamber, madam speaker. the floor is nearly empty. if democrats really, truthfully want to raise taxes on americans during a recession, that is their choice. that is the power they have. they have proven it time and again, and they will do it. the very least you can do, madam speaker, is show up in person if you are going to vote ``yes.'' show up in person to the american public. for those who chant: ``yes, gasoline is lower than it was 2 years ago; yes, the border is safer than it was 2 years ago,'' do not say it when the cameras are off. do not say it when people cannot see who is saying it. go to the mikes. if you believe it, go to the mikes and say it. better yet, tell your district about it because they know differently. america knows differently. but if you want to vote ``yes,'' you should have the courage and the decency to show up and do that in person. yet, madam speaker, speaker pelosi extended proxy voting again on wednesday, allowing democrats to hide their faces and vote to take your money from the comfort of their summer vacations. ``absolute power corrupts absolutely,'' madam speaker. that is a famous quote. there are lots of lessons people learn. normally, the lesson you learn the most is when you cause the most pain. i guess creating inflation you have not had in 41 years, creating shortages where there is no baby formula, gas prices that we have not seen since jimmy carter was in office, a border that is wide open, a government, madam speaker, that had an attorney general call parents terrorists because--what did they do? they went to a school board meeting. why would they go? why would parents go to a school board meeting? because they wanted to know what was happening in their kids' education, the lost learning of the years of the pandemic. if you question authority, you are going to be called a terrorist. how far would we go to be able to have the rights to do that? we are going to find an organization, a union, that will send us a letter so we can do it. but when the public finds out why, the union pulls their letter back. but the ag does not pull back their power because they have power, they should use it. is that why you want to double the size of the irs? is that why you want to double the size of the irs, to go after americans, to use it? earlier today, we had 80 democrats use a proxy vote. as we approach this final vote on this bill, depending on how long i speak, i expect that number might increase. if you think about it, that is the story of this democrat majority. they will destroy our economy and mortgage your future but cannot be personally bothered to show up, to make the trip to d.c. to do their jobs. what a disgrace. what a disgrace. i will promise the american public that that will all change. if you run for [[page h7693]] office, if you are going to ask them to lend their vote and to lend their voice to go to washington for 2 years to represent them, you are going to show up. and do you know what? the bills are going to be in committee. the bills are going to be read. they are going to be debated on the floor, and you are not going to hide in your vacation home and raise taxes on the american public. i will even go further. we will lower your gas prices. we will make america energy independent. we will not punish natural gas. if you care about the environment, american natural gas is 41 percent cleaner than russian natural gas. we will make an abundance of it. so those people who are living on a $75,000 income who have watched it get dwindled under your leadership, under your american rescue plan that simply took a whole month's salary away from them, and where they had no say, you celebrated it, you cheered it, and then you blamed everybody else for what you created. we will tell you it will cost less. for the parent that wakes up that morning--maybe it is a phone call or maybe their kid is home, who does not wake up because they went out and purchased something that was not fentanyl but it was laced with fentanyl, we will make sure that stops. it is august. right now is normally the time people have barbecues, but now the price is high. now people question whether to even get the hotdog buns. they are going to turn on the tv, they are going to watch an empty chamber, and they are going to read online that 80 democrats took that vacation and voted to raise more taxes, voted to spend more of their money, and looked into the camera and smiled and said: we know best. we want to take more of your money because we have got to hire and double the size of the irs because we want them to knock on your door because we think you are not honest and because we think you can pay more. and if you do not, we have got an ag that will come after you. if you go to that school board meeting, we will look in your eyes, we will take your name down, and we will wonder why you care about your kids' education. madam speaker, that will end, too, because we are going to provide the american public with a parents' bill of rights. we think that parents should have a say in their kids' education. we think that parents should know what is being taught at their children's schools. madam speaker, i even watched, under this leadership, a democrat who voted by proxy who was not even in america. so i wondered: were they in another country to get healthcare? were they sick? no, no, no. they were in france at a wedding when they phoned that vote in. i was not quite sure. do you think at the wedding the member was reading the bill on the phone so that member knew how to vote? i am not sure it came through committee. i do not know how much debate they had on this because the senate did this bill. what a disgrace. madam speaker, i urge all my colleagues to reject this out-of-touch bill, reject the crushing new taxes, reject the ballooning of government, and reject the spending on things that we do not need with money we do not have. madam speaker, i can wait, if you need to continue. but most of all, i urge my colleagues to remember this day. remember this day because it will be the last time the house will operate so recklessly and irresponsibly. a new day is coming with a new plan to put america back on the right track. it will be a commitment to america that there will be fiscal responsibility and there will be energy independence where your gasoline price will be lower and plentiful, that your home heating costs will lower and not rise; and that we will not pick one energy over the other. it will be all of the above so america can be stronger. your border will be secure because fentanyl and terrorists will not be coming across. this border is a national security issue. we will focus on bringing the supply chain from china back to america, which is not what this bill does. this bill takes american taxpayer money and sends it to china. you triple the size of the epa. i imagine china is cheering, because they see their economy is going to rise. their government does not have to vote for a stimulus, because that is exactly what you are doing here. what is even greater, china will look and say: well, can we make sure america can send all that money here? do not worry, the democrats doubled the size of the irs. they will get that money and make sure it comes. in the commitment to america, we believe people show up to go to work and that you earn your paycheck. you do not phone it in. madam speaker, when i handed the gavel to speaker pelosi last year, i said that a house distracted could not govern. today, as this majority jams through yet another partisan spending spree, it is clear to me that an absent house cannot lead. i trust the american people. i know it is the people who will render the ultimate verdict on today's actions. when they do 87 days from now, my democratic colleagues will have only themselves to blame. madam speaker, i am not sure what is happening on your side of the aisle that members actually believe gasoline is less than it was 2 years ago. madam speaker, i am not sure what is happening on your side of the aisle that your colleagues believe the border is more secure than it was 2 years ago. madam speaker, i am not sure what is happening on your side of the aisle that your colleagues believe the price of groceries is less than it was 2 years ago. madam speaker, i am not sure what is happening on the other side of the aisle that your colleagues believe doubling the size of the irs is a positive thing. {time} 1615 yes, i come from a different party, and yes, i have a different philosophy, but we are all americans. madam speaker, you are going inflict this pain on every single american. madam speaker, i am not sure if your side of the aisle thinks this is going to do anything to lower the price of inflation. i do know, madam speaker, one person on the other side of the aisle in the other chamber, bernie sanders, spoke the truth and said it will not. i know on your side of the aisle, madam speaker, not everybody believes the same. the former secretary of the treasury warned you before you did the american rescue plan that it would bring inflation, and he was right. even the current secretary of the treasury finally apologized and said they were wrong. the president said it was going to be transitory. he said it had peaked. he said it was everybody else's fault, but now he says it is zero. madam speaker, i guess i do understand why your side of the aisle now believes all that. i just know america does not. because every day america goes to the grocery store, the price has increased. every week when they fill up their gas tank, the price is higher. every month when they cash their check, it does not go as far. madam speaker, if the border was really more secure than it was 2 years ago, why is the d.c. mayor now asking for the national guard when she would not even ask for it when there were riots in the streets? madam speaker, my colleagues on the other side can lie to me, but they cannot lie to america. eighty-seven days from now it does not matter how you try to answer those questions. the american people will. i remember when we were at this stage once before. we had somebody in the white house that put a sweater on and told us to turn the heater down, that the best days were behind us as americans. i watched another person walk to the podium and say no pastels, fly the bold colors, and go to that shining city on the hill. we know what america is. and we are more than a country. we are an idea, an idea so powerful that we can overcome all the pain that you have caused. it will not be easy. and i will offer this invitation. for all the bad votes you have taken, when the change comes, we will welcome you to correct the mistakes you have made. because you will be in committee. maybe you will learn that gas prices are higher. maybe you will learn that groceries cost more. you will be here to vote so you will [[page h7694]] hear the debate. maybe i cannot blame you for thinking that if you do not have to show up. madam speaker, there are a lot of days on this floor that change the course of history. in the last 2 years, that history has not been bright. inflation, a 41-year-history high. do you understand what that does to the american public? do you understand the pain that it causes? do you understand the choices that people have to make? i heard the story of a young family, their daughter has cancer. for her treatment they have to drive a long way. she was crying one day because she heard her parents talking about making the decision to take out loans they cannot afford to pay for the gasoline that your side of the aisle thinks costs them less but costs them more, the choices they had to make because you titled a bill ``american rescue plan'' that only inflicts pain, and you just doubled down. madam speaker, i would respect the other side of the aisle much greater if they would at least do exactly what secretary yellen did, apologize for your mistake and change course. do not double down. do not make the same mistake three, four times like you are going to do today. at the very least--at the very least, if you are going to vote ``yes,'' do it in person. do it in person. read the bill. put it through committee. madam speaker, i have watched this body take on big issues. we have got some of the biggest issues before us today. you continue to make it just a partisan action, one that even your side of the aisle has warned you against. but somehow you want to celebrate it. madam speaker, in my office in a conference room, i have this painting of washington crossing the delaware. you all know the famous painting. it sits 8 feet by 16 feet. if you study history, you will know that it happened christmas 1776. the artist who painted that famous painting was not even american. he was not there. he had no iphone that day to take a photo. the person who painted the painting is a german immigrant who lived in america but went back to germany. his name is emanuel leutze. do you know why he painted that painting? because he understood america was more than a country, that america was an idea. he wanted germany to have a revolution based upon the values of america, of freedom, of individual rights, of a stand against tyranny, that government would be of the people, by the people, for the people. his talent was art, so he thought he would paint this painting to inspire the germans to have this revolution. now, historians will tell you he gets it incorrect. he puts 13 people in a rowboat. why would he pick the number 13? thirteen colonies. but he only shows you 12 faces. if you look at the painting, he puts washington in a rowboat, but historians will tell you washington probably crossed in a durham boat. if you look at the delaware, it kind of looks like the rhine. but he is german. we will give him a break for that. he puts washington in a ceremonial uniform with his hand on his chest standing up in a rowboat crossing the delaware in the middle of winter. he looks so stoic. if you look at washington in that painting, you would almost say you would follow this man anywhere. you would think he had never lost a battle or a fight. but for the students of history, they understand at that moment in time, washington had never won a battle. we had never won one fight as a country. but that was our first victory, as we surprised the hessians. but what i would like you to see next time is who is in the boat. the second person is wearing a beret. he is scottish. the person directly across from him in the green jacket, he is african american. you come down the boat, and in the middle of the boat, the person who almost looks the strongest, rowing in the red, is a woman. in the very back, the very last person, is a native american. i cannot tell you from a historical point of view if they were in the boat that night. but to this young immigrant who had lived in america, that is who he believed would be in the boat. now, the second to last person in the boat, he has a hand across his face. it is the hand of the 13th person nobody sees. what this artist was saying--emanuel, i believe--here we are, not a country but an idea, having lost every battle before but willing to create a nation. why? to go against the tyranny of a government that will tax you with no say, a government that became so big it can inflict pain upon you, tell you what to do, that we would risk it on our holiest of night. here is a hand. would you get in and join us? that is as true today as it was then. the challenge that we face right now is you are making that government big. you are doubling the size of the irs. you are going against every single reason people were in that boat willing to risk their lives for a government of the people, by the people, for the people, a government that was created in a country that was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that we are all equal, because you think you know what is best. i can only imagine what those individuals would think today, that you would put a bill on the floor that did not go through committee. you put a bill on the floor that would double the size of the irs, that could go after the american public, that has no set on an income, that 710,000 people under the income of $75,000 are now going to be audited because you want them to pay for what you think is best, that you are going to tax, with no limit on income, some family that already lost a month's salary based upon your past actions because of inflation. you are going to make them choose how cold. you are going back to jimmy carter. you are simply telling the american public to put that sweater on, turn that heater down. but to your elite donors, you are going to give them the tax credit from those irs agents so they can go buy a new tesla. that is what you are doing in this bill. but 4 to 6 months from now, you will blame somebody else for it. the good news is, there will be a new congress with a new ability to change all that, that will provide the american public a commitment to america, a new plan to put this country back in the right direction. madam speaker, with whatever happens today--and i can only guess, if you have all the votes in your pocket that people do not have to show up, one or two people can determine the outcome. but, madam speaker, i implore upon you--i do not know what happens in your conference--please allow the american public to come in to simply tell you and explain to you that, no, gas is not lower, groceries do not cost less, and the money does not go as far as it did before. maybe that is why i can only understand, if you truly believe that, that you would vote ``yes.'' for everybody else that is living in the real america, they will vote ``no.'' and 87 days from now, i believe most of america will have the answer to that question, too, with a new congress and a new plan. mr. pallone. madam speaker, may i inquire how much time is remaining? the speaker pro tempore (ms. jacobs of california). the gentleman from new jersey has 3 minutes remaining. the time of the gentleman from kentucky has expired. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i yield myself 1 minute. i will speak briefly before i introduce our two leaders who have done so much on the democratic side to make this bill a possibility today. the republican leader said that we should listen to our constituents. well, we have. yesterday, i was at a senior center in woodbridge, and a woman came up to me and said: you know, congressman pallone, i spend $1,500 a month on prescription drugs. and i was able to say to her: i am going to be in washington tomorrow. i am going to vote on a bill that is going to cap your expenditures at $2,000 a year. then i had another woman in a telehealth meeting earlier in the week who told me that she was so hot, because in new jersey we have had the worst drought and the highest temperatures that we know in years, and she said: i have to go to a cooling center because of the heat, because of my health and the impact on my health. {time} 1630 i was able to say to her: look, it is going to take a while, but tomorrow--this friday--i am going to vote on a bill that is going to address the climate change and the heating and the warming of this planet. [[page h7695]] madam speaker, i want to thank our two leaders for what they have done to bring this about today. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from maryland (mr. hoyer). mr. hoyer. madam speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. today will be the culmination of the meeting of promises that president biden made to the american people resulting in some 7 to 8 million more people voting for president biden than the incumbent president. my colleagues, we have just heard from the leader of the party of: you are on your own. the leader who just spoke voted against the american rescue plan that put money in the pockets of american families, put american children back to school, and resulted in our not wearing masks today by--with some exceptions--putting vaccine in arms. the leader who just spoke voted ``no,'' as did every one of his colleagues. they said ``no'' to money to help families not fall through the cracks, to help them afford their groceries, to help them afford to pay their mortgage, and to send their kids to school. they voted ``no'' to make sure those vaccines were in arms. they voted ``no'' to help small businesses, restaurants, and others be lifted up. the party of: you are on your own, america. and yes, when they came to office, what did they try to do in 2017? repeal healthcare support for the american people. we are doing the opposite. we plead guilty. the leader of the republican party who just spoke voted ``no'' on the infrastructure bill to respond to building roads and bridges and to making sure they are maintained and safe; to respond to broadband to make sure that rural areas are connected, and with airports to make sure we had a grid that made us competitive. the gentleman who just spoke voted ``no.'' as far as the chips bill, the gentleman talked about china. china was lobbying against the chips bill. the minority leader voted ``no'' on the chips bill, which was a bill to make america competitive and create hundreds of thousands of jobs. that was bipartisan in the house by a small degree and in the senate, as well. but the minority leader voted ``no.'' so i must say that i am not shocked that he is voting ``no'' on this bill, which is aimed at helping americans with their healthcare, which is one of the greatest reasons for inflation. i am not surprised that he mischaracterized the reaction on this side of the aisle when he said gas prices were high and have not come down. in fact, in the last 40 days, they have come down 20 percent. the gentleman is shaking his head, no, no, they have not. i do not know where he is buying gas, but they have come down from $5 to $4, and in some cases less than $4. is that too high? yes, it is. should we be concerned about that? yes, we should be. we passed two bills. one was a bill to make sure that we did not have price gouging. no american wants to see price gouging. the minority leader voted ``no'' on that bill. we offered another bill that dealt with food and fuel prices and to try to make sure that we have delivery systems and supply chains that worked. the minority leader and his colleagues voted ``no''--not everyone. we had a bill on this floor that tried to help and is going to help millions of veterans who had been exposed to toxic burn pits--cancer, heart disease, and lung disease. the minority leader, it will not shock you, voted ``no'' to help veterans. we had another bill on the floor to make sure that we could preclude and try to help women who had violent acts committed against them. it may not surprise you that the leader of the party of: you are on your own voted ``no'' on the violence against women act. it is time to say ``yes,'' yes to the people, to focus on people and not on the politics of 87 days from now. that is what this is about: politics pure--well, impure--and simple. it is time for us to say ``yes'' to bringing prices down. now, i want to add just a couple of things, and i want to talk about the four pieces of legislation that are changing america for the better. he wrings his hands about the awful situation that america is in. in january of 2021, before joe biden became president of the united states, unemployment was 6.4 percent. during the course of the trump administration, we had lost 2.8 million jobs; a net loss after 4 years--net loss. over the last 18 months, we have created 9.5 million jobs. that is almost a 12 million-job turnaround, to the best, to the good, to the appreciation of ability of americans to get jobs. and he mentioned something about gas prices. are they high? they are. let me tell you when they were higher. in july of 2008 they were higher. hear me. go check the records. $4.14, which in real dollars today would be $5.62 under george bush. are prices too high? they are. do we want to bring them down? yes, we do. that is why we fought price gouging on food and fuel, both of which the minority leader voted against. as i said, unemployment in january was 6.4 percent. it is now 3.5 percent; halved. is inflation too high? it is. we passed a bill. some people said, well, that is going to cause inflation. what it caused was people did not fall through the cracks. they were able to pay their bills. they were able to send their kids back to school. that is what it did. that is what the american people are going to remember, that the democratic party was there for them and the republican party was not. then we talk about this money that we are going to give to irs, which has been reduced 20 percent under the republican leadership when they were in charge. what did they reduce? enforcement. why? because they did not want their big, fat cat people to be caught not paying their fair share. yes, mr. and mrs. america, you are paying a higher price because some people pay nothing. you do not think that is fair, and we do not think it is fair. and, yes, we want to make sure the rules are followed. in order to have the rules followed, you need referees. and when you have 100-some-odd million taxpayers, you need a number of people to find that out and make sure that you obey the law. yes, we support that. we believe in facts, and we believe in truth. there is a republican leader--no longer a leader--who believed in facts and truth, and liz cheney was fired from her position because she told the truth and confronted a former president who promotes lying. madam speaker, when president biden took office with a democratic congress, we promised the american people results. we are delivering. we promised we would make progress on the issues where progress has been stalled for far too long. we promised, in short, responsible government that gets things done ``for the people.'' people, not politics. we promised responsible government that puts the needs of our people over politics. over the past 18 months, many have questioned whether that would even be possible. our country is too divided, they said, to achieve big goals and enact really consequential legislation that benefits the american people and our economy. madam speaker, 9.5 million new jobs in 18 months. over these same 18 months, however, our democratic majorities and the biden-harris administration have proven those doubters wrong. the legislation we will pass today and send to the president's desk is the fourth leg of a table of support and opportunity democrats have built for the american people. the first leg was the american rescue plan. that law put more than 200 million shots in arms and made it safe again for workers to go back to their jobs, for students and teachers to go back to school, and for entrepreneurs [[page h7696]] to take risks and invest in their businesses. it worked. since then, we have seen record job growth. as i have said, 9.5 million jobs have been created since last january. that is the largest number of jobs created in 18 months in the history of our country and the lowest rate of employment in half a century. only republicans could call that failure, because it was not their success. more americans are working today than at any point in our history. we also cut child poverty in half. perhaps that is not seen as a success by the other side of the aisle. next, we brought democrats and republicans together in a historic effort to enact the bipartisan infrastructure plan, which is already rebuilding roads, bridges, transit systems, seaports, and airports in every corner of our country, after president trump said in 2016 that he was going to do a trillion dollars. in 2017 it did not happen. in 2018 it did not happen. in 2019 it did not happen. the republicans were in charge of the house, senate, and the presidency of the united states. inattention and disrepair. for years, we heard people talking about ``infrastructure weeks.'' do you remember that? the minority leader and others: we are going to have an infrastructure week. it never happened. last november, we put people over politics and got it done. that decision was so successful that even many of the republicans who voted against it are cutting ribbons that will facilitate commerce and improve the lives of their constituents, even though they did not support the bill. one side effect of the pandemic was to magnify the cracks in our economic system and our reliance on the unreliable in our supply chains. any family trying to buy a new car or trying to budget for a new appliance in the last year or two understands what that means. and by the way, on inflation, europe did not have the rescue plan. asia did not have the rescue plan. other nations did not have the rescue plan. guess what, madam speaker? all of them are experiencing inflation, half of them greater inflation than is present in the united states of america. does that mean we have to stop our efforts to reduce it? of course not. is it hurting our people? it is. are empty shelves on grocery stores troubling? they are. {time} 1645 rather than blame one another, perhaps we ought to look at the real villain, and that was the pandemic. earlier this week, president biden signed the chips and science act, the third leg of our table of support and opportunity, into law. that bipartisan legislation will ease inflation by bringing manufacturing and sources of critical components and products back to the united states so that we make them in america, and our workers make it in america. it means that we will not cede the next century of innovation to china or anybody else. china--let me repeat--lobbied against that bill, and almost every republican voted against that bill, just like china wanted. instead, american labor and american innovation will continue to lead the world in research, innovation, and advanced manufacturing and continue to draw the brightest minds from around the world. that also will mean lower costs for american families. the chips and science act was another significant piece of legislation under the make it in america agenda. it is hard to think that somebody would vote against all four of these bills--a promise made to america and a promise that they relied on and they voted for in an election--not a poll, not a survey, and not a focus group--in an election. that is because it gets to the heart of what government is supposed to do: help provide our workers, businesses, and people with the tools and confidence to make it in america. today, we are going to send to president biden the legislation that represents the fourth leg of our table of support and opportunity: the inflation reduction act. as its name suggests, it will further help lower costs for americans. first, it will lower healthcare costs by extending the cost-saving premium tax credits under the affordable care act that we included in the american rescue plan, which has gotten us to 92 percent coverage in america. and, very frankly, it would be higher if there were not states who had refused to provide the medicaid opportunity for citizens who fell in the middle of the income spectrum. we included that, of course, but our republican friends in the united states senate would not agree to it. this bill will provide for quality, affordable healthcare to almost every person in the united states, irrespective of their income. the national uninsured rate has fallen, as i said, to an all-time low of 8 percent, with 5.2 million americans gaining coverage since the start of the biden-harris administration--in large part due to having made those cost-saving premium tax credits more widely available. my understanding is our republican friends are going to vote against this bill. millions of people will be unable to afford their insurance. that is extended by 3 years. next, it brings down the cost of prescription drugs by allowing medicare for the first time ever--but not uniquely because the veterans affairs does that, and it makes sense--to negotiate lower prices from manufacturers. democrats have been working for decades to achieve this goal. as i mentioned at the outset of my remarks, our majority is delivering on that promise. the bill also caps the cost of insulin at $35 a month. it would have been extended to everybody, but our republican friends refuse to support that alternative, so it is only going to apply to medicare at the beginning. we are not going to stop. we also capped the cost at $2,000 a year for seniors on medicare. we want to extend that to the private market as well, and we will work on that. madam speaker, this is a historic achievement that will save lives and allow more seniors to access life-saving and life-sustaining medications. additionally, the inflation reduction act is the largest single investment addressing the climate crisis that any nation has ever made. i do not know how it was at your place, but with temperatures of 95, 96, 97, and 98 degrees and high humidity, we have a climate crisis. the deniers have undermined our ability to respond. this bill responds. it responds consistent with the desires of the american people. it will bring down the cost of energy for americans by investing in developing and deploying cleaner, more sustainable energy technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels. at the same time, we are doing it without raising the deficit. in fact, the legislation reduces the deficit by closing loopholes so the largest corporations with profits over a billion dollars will pay a minimum tax rate of just 15 percent. the rate is 21 percent on corporations, but if they get over a billion dollars, they are going to pay at least 15 percent. why? because we protect their shipping lanes with our navy. we protect their roads that they transport goods across. they get a lot from their taxes, just as we all do. maybe that is why the republicans do not like this bill. that is well below the regular 21 percent tax, as i said. we do it all while ensuring that individuals and families earning less than $400,000 a year will not see a single tax increase. let me repeat that. nobody making less than $400,000 a year will see a tax increase. those four legs: the rescue plan, the infrastructure bill, the chips bill, and now this reduction in inflation act will provide for growth, opportunity, and competitiveness for our economy and for our people. there is, however, another critical piece of legislation that helps keep that table sturdy. let us recap this list of major enactments: getting americans back to work from the pandemic. that is what we did. securing long-overdue infrastructure investments. that is what we did. easing the inflation by helping american companies build more chips, semiconductors, and other critical components here instead of importing [[page h7697]] them from unreliable countries. over 100,000 new jobs. that is what we did. reducing inflation by lowering healthcare prescription drug and energy costs while combating the climate crisis. that is what we did. we will keep on doing it for the american people in the next congress. in addition to all these, the democrat-led house has passed many, many more important bills that have yet to be considered in the senate--blocked by republicans. today, with the inflation reduction act, we will answer any who still doubt whether we can deliver on our promises. today, democrats and this administration are showing that we can and will continue to put people over politics and ensure that our people can make it in america. vote for america. vote for the american people. vote for this bill. mr. pallone. madam speaker, to close the debate, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california (ms. pelosi), the speaker of the house, who has done so much to bring this bill to final passage today. ms. pelosi. madam speaker, i thank you for your tremendous leadership and the other chairs for bringing this legislation to the floor. the hour is growing late, and as a courtesy to my colleagues, i intend to shorten my remarks. for those that i shorten the remarks, i promise to put them in the record if you promise to read them. let me also begin by saying that i associate myself with the remarks of all of my democratic colleagues, and that covers a lot of territory. madam speaker, under the visionary leadership of president biden, democrats have forged historic progress for america's families. first, we enacted our life-saving american rescue plan: to propel us out of the pandemic by putting money in pockets, vaccines in arms, children safely in school, and people back to work. next, we secured the transformative bipartisan infrastructure package to create good-paying union jobs rebuilding our nation. this week, president biden signed the chips and science act, which declares our economic independence, strengthens our national security, and enhances our families' financial future. we also honored the valiant service of our men and women in uniform with the pact act. today, madam speaker, is a day of celebration, a day we take another giant step in our momentous agenda. our inflation reduction act is a robust, cost-cutting package that meets the moment: ensuring that our families thrive and that our planet survives. this is landmark legislation which we send to the president's desk, and it is a resounding victory for america's families starting at their kitchen table. what it means to you--to our constituents, to people out there whom we serve in terms of healthcare--if you are one of medicare's 64 million enrollees, this bill brings down the out-of- pocket costs in prescription drugs. we do this by empowering the secretary of hhs to negotiate lower prices, at long last. we have been fighting for this for years. we do so by capping out-of-pocket prescription drug costs. and you, our constituents, will not pay one more cent for life-saving medication. this includes a $35 cap on insulin copays. we do this by banning drug manufacturers from raising prices faster than inflation, protecting you against predatory price hikes. make no mistake: these measures are a big blow to big pharma, which has had a stranglehold for decades, preventing us from making this move. now we have relaxed that stranglehold a bit--there is more to be done--but we give more leverage and more breathing room to america's families. at the same time, this bill locks in lower premiums that democrats secured first in the rescue package. together, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and healthcare premiums are vital strides in our fight for economic justice. this is particularly important to low- income communities, underserved communities, and communities of color. in doing so, we honor the call of dr. king, who said: ``of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhumane because it often results in physical death.'' the inflation bill is a plan divided into three parts: prescription drugs and healthcare; second, the most consequential climate action in the history of our congress of our country. doing these two things will reduce the deficit. at the same time, this legislation advances president biden's and democrats' relentless commitment to putting justice first. all of these crucial investments are fully paid for by making sure the ultra-rich and biggest corporations pay their fair share. the climate provisions will make a meaningful difference for america's working families. i am going to put that in the record, if you promise to read it, but it is about clean air and clean water for our children. it is about 9 million good-paying union jobs. it is about preventing conflict over resources and habitat. it is about values-- values espoused by pope francis when he said earlier this summer that our planet has reached a ``breaking point'' in the fight against climate crisis. extreme weather continues to wreak havoc across the country and around the world, and it is clear the costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of action. the bill saves the planet while keeping more money in your pockets. for working families, you will save an average of $1,000 a year and lower energy bills. for underserved communities, this bill invests $60 billion in environmental justice initiatives to ensure that everyone enjoys the benefits of a cleaner, green economy. {time} 1700 again, the bill pays down the deficit by $300 billion in the first decade. here is what it means to you: it lowers the deficit and drives down inflation in the long term. these monumental investments for families and healthcare are fully paid for ensuring the biggest corporations and wealthiest pay their fair share. that is an estimate of about $160 billion a year of taxes that are unlawfully not paid. right now families are being harmed by corporate profiteering. but let me just say that i do not want you to take it from me. i want you to take it from a large number of economists--126--including seven nobel prize winners and three former chairs of the council of economic advisers in a letter urging passage of this bill. i want you to hear this, my republican friends, because clearly you do not know this. but now that you do, perhaps you will change your comments. these investments will fight inflation and lower costs for american families while setting the stage for strong, stable, and broadly- shared, long-term economic growth. madam speaker, i include in the record their letter. august 2, 2022. hon. charles schumer, majority leader, u.s. senate, washington, dc. hon. mitch mcconnell, majority leader, u.s. senate, washington, dc. hon. nancy pelosi, speaker, house of representatives, washington, dc. hon. kevin mccarthy, minority leader, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear senate majority leader schumer, senate minority leader mcconnell, speaker pelosi, and house minority leader mccarthy: we write to strongly urge you and your colleagues in congress to swiftly pass the inflation reduction act of 2022. this historic legislation makes crucial investments in energy, health care, and in shoring up the nation's tax system. these investments will fight inflation and lower costs for american families while setting the stage for strong, stable, and broadly-shared long-term economic growth. this legislation represents the single biggest step to date in tackling the climate crisis. it makes key investments to incentivize the transition to cleaner energy sources and greater efficiency. it also invests in the current energy distribution system to make it more resilient, lowers energy costs for families, and helps protect u.s. family budgets against future shocks. this legislation will quickly and noticeably bring down health care costs for families. it allows medicare to negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies, reduces medicare out-of-pocket costs for drugs, and reduces insurance costs for 13 million americans by building on provisions in the affordable care act. [[page h7698]] these investments would be more than fully paid for. the revenue raised to finance them would come exclusively from wealthy individuals and corporations. further, the revenue stems from enhanced tax enforcement and closing some of the most distortionary loopholes in the tax code. this proposal addresses some of the country's biggest challenges at a significant scale. and because it is deficit- reducing, it does so while putting downward pressure on inflation. we strongly recommend congress act decisively to build a stronger economy by passing the inflation reduction act as soon as possible. sincerely, joseph stiglitz, columbia university;

[[page h7699]] health care: prescription drugs this landmark legislation, which we send to the president's desk today, is a resounding victory for america's families--starting at the kitchen table. here's what the inflation reduction act means to you in terms of health care. if you are one of medicare's 64 million enrollees, this bill will bring down your out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. we do so by empowering the hhs secretary to negotiate for lower drug prices--a long-standing house democratic priority. we do so by capping your out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000, so you will not pay one cent more for life-saving medication. this includes a $35 per month cap on insulin co-pays. and we do so by banning drug manufactures from raising prices faster than inflation, protecting you against predatory price hikes. make no mistake: these provisions will strike a big blow to big pharma, while giving families more breathing room in their budgets. health care: aca subsidies at the same time, the inflation reduction act also locks in lower premiums that democrats secured in our rescue package. if you are one of 13 million working americans who has affordable coverage under the aca: you will be able to keep your insurance--and you will continue to save $800 per year on your premium. together, lowering the costs of prescription drugs and health premiums are vital strides in the fight for economic justice. indeed, these benefits will flow heavily to those most in need: vulnerable seniors, underserved communities and communities of color. and in doing so, we honor the call of dr. king, who said: ``of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and inhuman because it often results in physical death.'' ira overview the inflation reduction act is a plan divided into three parts: first--as i just discussed--lowering the cost of prescription drugs and health care premiums second, delivering the most consequential climate action in history and third, dramatically reducing the deficit. at the same time, this legislation advances president biden and democrats' relentless commitment to putting justice first. and all of these crucial investments are fully paid-for by making sure the ultra-rich and biggest corporations pay their fair share. to my house democratic colleagues, make no mistake: this important progress rests on the foundation that we built--with the build back better act last fall and in the last congress. so let us salute the tenacious and tireless leadership of our chairs, members and staff, who helped make this joyous day possible. climate action the climate provisions in the inflation reduction act will also make a meaningful difference for america's working families. our bill cuts carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030--and powers our nation toward a clean energy future. it is about health: clean air and clean water for our children it is about jobs: 9 million good-paying union jobs it is about security: preventing conflict over resources and habitat and it is about values: passing on a healthy planet to future generations as pope francis said earlier this summer, our planet has reached a ``breaking point'' in the fight against the climate crisis. as extreme weather continues to wreak havoc across our country and around the world, it is clear the costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of action. this bill saves the planet, while keeping more money in your pockets. for working families: you will save an average of $1000 per year on your energy bills by the end of the decade. for our farmers: this bill supports you in cultivating a diverse, climate-friendly agriculture system--which will help address food inflation. for underserved communities: this bill invests $60 billion in environmental justice initiatives to ensure everyone will share in the benefits of our transition to a cleaner, greener economy. in doing so, we ensure we not only mitigate a far more catastrophic future--but build a safe, sustainable planet for our children and grandchildren. deficit reduction america's working families will also greatly benefit from the inflation reduction act's historic investment to get our fiscal house in order. this bill pays down the deficit by $300 billion over the first decade. and nonpartisan analysis shows that it will reduce the deficit by nearly $2 trillion over two decades decade. here's what that means to you: slashing the deficit will drive down inflation in the long-term. this builds on the progress democrats have already forged: with our nation on track to slash the deficit by a record $1.5 trillion this year alone. meanwhile, democrats' record of fiscal responsibility stands in sharp contrast to the trump tax scam, which ballooned the deficit by nearly $2 trillion and left working families behind. paying their fair share these monumental investments for our families--in health care, climate action and deficit reduction--are fully paid for by ensuring the biggest corporations and the wealthiest few pay their fair share. right now, families are being harmed by corporate profiteering with impunity: billion-dollar companies paying little-to-no taxes, while jacking up prices and refusing to fairly pay their workers. that is why we are closing loopholes by implementing: a 15 percent corporate minimum tax only on billion-dolar companies; and a 1 percent tax on stock buybacks, which enrich executives and shareholders. we are also taking on ultra-rich tax cheats, ensuring they cannot continue to dodge what they owe to our nation: an estimated $160 billion each year. let me be clear: this bill does not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year, honoring the president's promise to america's families. and despite republicans' desperate falsehoods, this bill does not increase irs audits on america's working families. treasury secretary yellen has directed the irs commissioner not to increase the audit rate for households making under $400,000 a year. and the irs commissioner himself--a republican appointed by trump-- said: ``these resources are absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income americans.'' fighting inflation the provisions in this legislation are a powerful force to fight inflation. it is encouraging that prices at the pump have fallen for nearly sixty days straight--and that the latest data shows 0 percent inflation in july. but democrats know that higher prices still weigh heavy on america's families. and now, we take another strong step to further drive down kitchen table costs. outside support but do not take my word for it. take the word of 126 economists--including seven nobel prize winners, three former chairs of the council of economic advisers and two farmer treasury secretaries. in a letter urging passage of this bill, they wrote: ``these investments will fight inflation and lower costs for american families--while setting the stage for strong, stable, and broadly- shared long-term economic growth.'' public support and proudly, the american people are with us: three-quarters support our action to lower prescription drug costs, two-thirds support our clean energy provisions, 60 percent support billion-dollar companies paying their fair share. gop opposition but sadly, our colleagues across the aisle clearly prefer to keep costs for families sky-high. senate republicans unanimously voted against this bill. and now, house republican leaders are whipping against it. their opposition is unconscionable. how could anyone vote against lowering health care costs on seniors and underserved communities as we continue to fight inflation? how could anyone vote against protecting future generations from rising sea levels, raging wildfires and crippling droughts? how could anyone vote against reducing the deficit or asking billiondollar companies and wealthy tax cheats to pay their fair share? close: people over politics madam speaker, today, every member of this body will be confronted with a basic choice. will you put people over politics--or politics over people? for centuries, members of congress have stood exactly where we stand now, facing this exact same decision, as they constructed the pillars of the american economy and society. social [[page h7700]] security. medicare and medicaid. the affordable care act. today, the congress carries forward this all-american tradition. the inflation reduction act is a package for the people: increasing the leverage of the public interest over the special interest, and expanding the promise of health and financial security, now and for generations to come. so i urge every member to put aside partisan difference--put people over politics--and vote yes on the inflation reduction act, as we send this historic legislation to president biden's desk for his signature. mr. nadler. madam speaker, today, i rise in strong support of the inflation reduction act--landmark legislation that will have a lasting impact on our planet and help lower costs for americans in new york city and across our country. from lowering prescription drug prices and health care costs for working families to including the most significant climate investment in our nation's history, the inflation reduction act includes policies i have long fought for. with this legislation, our nation can finally rise to the seriousness of the moment in our fight against climate change by making the large- scale investments needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030, lower energy costs for families, and create millions of good-paying clean energy jobs across our country. i am thrilled that with this legislation, our government will finally be able to negotiate the prices of some of our nation's costliest prescription drugs--drugs that have been on the market for years and reap billions of dollars in sales from medicare alone. i am proud that the inflation reduction act will bring down health care costs for over 3.7 million new yorkers and will result in enormous savings for taxpayers. with the passage of this bill, democrats are showing american families that our federal government can deliver for the people, not just special corporate interests. i look forward to voting to pass this historic legislation. mr. david scott of georgia. madam speaker, the inflation reduction act of 2022 before us today makes historic investments in climate change mitigation, our critical forestry and conservation programs, rural communities, and energy and biofuels infrastructure. this package makes important investments in our oversubscribed farm bill conservation programs. by expanding participation in these programs and providing increased technical assistance funding, farmers will more readily be able to employ proven conservation practices on their land, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and sequester carbon. i have always believed that agriculture should be the tip of the spear in addressing the harmful effects of climate change. this legislation helps make that a reality. my colleagues may complain about the steps we had to take to ensure this additional funding for our farm bill conservation programs, i would note that our colleagues on the other side have similarly extended the authorization of farm bill authorizations, but in those cases, it was to cut funding from them. in this exercise, we are including additional funding, which will be beneficial as we look to writing the 2023 farm bill. major investments in forestry will also help to combat climate change, reduce risk of catastrophic wildfire, and ensure that our public and private lands have the tools they need to continue to serve as our largest carbon sinks. in addition to the carbon benefits, this bill helps restore forest ecosystems, improve watershed health, and enhance wildlife habitat by providing much needed funding. additionally, the forestry provisions of the bill will help bring rural prosperity to many parts of our nation by ensuring that we are developing new, innovative, wood products, and by making sure that underserved communities can benefit from emerging climate mitigation markets. this bill makes sure that urban communities have access to forestry programs by providing needed funding for urban and community forestry. expanding the tree canopy in urban areas is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to address temperature impacts and air quality issues, and i am sorry some of my colleagues do not recognize that. the inflation reduction act's investments in rural communities, energy, and biofuels will help lower energy bills, increase the efficiency of energy systems, and provide opportunities for farmers and small business owners to employ emission reducing technology in their operations. increasing energy efficiency is good for their bottom lines and good for the climate. this legislation also provides significant support for rural electric cooperatives as they transition to renewable and zero emission energy systems, and it also increases access to clean biofuels across the nation. this bill provides expedited relief to direct and guaranteed farm loan borrowers at risk of losing their farming operations. it also allows usda to help farmers and ranchers who have suffered discrimination in farm service agency farm loan programs. it requires usda to use one or more nongovernmental entities to help provide this assistance. lastly, it builds upon the american rescue plan efforts to increase access to capital and land for our beginning and underserved producers by expanding access to technical assistance, financial training, cooperative development, and assistance to address heirs' property issues. and part of this effort includes bolstering the capacity at our 1890 and 1994 land grant, insular area, and other minority-serving institutions in the areas of research, education and extension. i want to thank the members of the agriculture committee for their hard work on this legislation. and i also want to thank the agriculture committee staff who have dedicated many hours over the last year to helping see this legislation through to its passage today. mrs. carolyn b. maloney of new york. madam speaker, i want to highlight the long-overdue reforms contained in this legislation to make lifesaving medicine affordable for the millions of medicare beneficiaries in this country. first, it will cap copayments for insulin products at $35 per month. my committee's investigation found that, since the 1990s, insulin manufacturers have been raising the price of this life-saving medicine, despite no improvements to the drug, while making record profits. this price gouging has harmed americans, and capping out-of-pocket costs is an important step to reducing insulin costs for seniors and people with disabilities. the inflation reduction act is also an incredible step forward in our efforts to protect americans from being overburdened with high out-of- pocket costs and healthcare-related expenses. for the first time, it would limit a beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs covered by medicare part d to $2,000 a year. my committee's investigation found that drug companies' price increases have imposed thousands of dollars in annual out-of-pocket costs on patients, especially for drugs that treat cancer or chronic conditions. this annual cap will provide much-needed financial protection, especially for the millions of beneficiaries who take high price drugs for cancer, rare diseases, or chronic conditions. additionally, the inflation reduction act will make health insurance coverage more affordable for millions of americans by extending key affordable care act (aca) tax credits through 2025, building on the important progress made by the american rescue plan signed into law last march. by providing tax credits for millions of consumers purchasing coverage through an aca marketplace, the american rescue plan expanded access to health insurance and made it significantly more affordable. since passage of the american rescue plan, four out of five consumers were able to find an aca marketplace plan for $10 or less per month. these savings allowed nearly 6 million new consumers to sign up for marketplace coverage during the first year of the biden-harris administration. this year, a record 14.5 million consumers have signed up for marketplace coverage, and the national uninsured rate recently reached a record low of 8.0 percent. the inflation reduction act extends these critical benefits for millions of americans, and continues our work to ensure that all people in this country have access to health insurance coverage. as chairwoman, i was also proud to include $50 million dollars in the inflation reduction act to ensure that the economic and environmental benefits of funding across the inflation reduction act are spread equitably. for decades, low-income communities and communities of color have suffered from chronic underinvestment while being forced to suffer the most severe health and economic impacts of pollution and climate change. we will not stand for that any longer. the inflation reduction act will lower costs, create better-paying jobs, and build healthier, more sustainable communities. with my committee's oversight funding included, we can make sure these benefits are being spread fairly and that clean energy investments support environmental justice communities that need them the most. finally, my committee worked to include almost a billion dollars to support for the deployment of emerging sustainable technologies to reduce emissions while also saving taxpayer dollars. this good government provision will support innovation to drive down the cost of clean energy solutions, which is better for consumers and better for our children's future. this is all accomplished alongside inflation-fighting measures that will cut the nation's deficit by a historic $300 billion without raising taxes on small businesses or on a single person or family in the middle class. the inflation reduction act closes loopholes that have allowed billionaire corporations to avoid paying their minimum fair share of income tax. [[page h7701]] thanks to this transformative legislation and today's historic vote, those days are behind us, and better days of a more fair and prosperous nation are ahead. it is an honor to send this legislation to the president's desk. ms. delauro. madam speaker, i rise today in strong support of h.r. 5376, the inflation reduction act. for years, americans have faced rising costs at grocery stores, pharmacies, and in recent months, at the gas pump. today, we will send this legislation to the president's desk to be signed into law so we can provide necessary relief to hardworking people across the country. the inflation reduction act takes historic steps to reduce the deficit and fight inflation, invest in domestic energy production and manufacturing, and tackle the climate crisis by reducing carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030. the bill will also lower prescription drug and health care costs by finally allowing medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and extending the expanded affordable care act program for three years. notably, this legislation makes sure that the biggest corporations and billionaires pay taxes. it establishes a 15 percent corporate minimum tax and invests in internal revenue service tax enforcement to ensure that the biggest corporations, the ultra-wealthy, and rich tax cheats pay their fair share. large corporations have been using inflation as an excuse to abuse their market power, jacking up prices for american consumers at the grocery store, the pharmacy, and at the gas pump. this law puts taxpayer dollars back into the pockets of working families. my vote today comes with a promise to my constituents in connecticut and to the american people--i will continue the fight for common sense, proven solutions like the child tax credit in the days and weeks to come. as i have said before, as american families face rising costs, the expanded child tax credit is one of our best tools to help them face these challenges. we still have so much work to do to address the problems being faced today by working families. today is an important step forward, and i am proud to cast my vote in support of this critical legislation. mr. hill. madam speaker, i rise today in opposition of what i call the inflation ``production'' act. there are obvious problems of increasing taxes in a recession, expanding obamacare, innovation killing price controls on drugs, and its attacks on american energy. hard working families, farmers, and small business owners in central arkansas are going to bear the brunt of citizens being audited at the highest rates due to more than doubling the size of the irs and it is increase in funding. what do we think the irs is going to do with this increase in staff and $45 billion in new enforcement funding? no agency needs six times its current funding to answer phone calls and improve customer service. i have seen claims that as long as you do not cheat on your taxes then you have nothing to worry about. clearly, they have never faced the harassment and excruciating process of an irs audit. we must defeat this legislation. mr. danny k. davis of illinois. madam speaker, i ran for congress to help people in chicago, in illinois, and across the country. the inflation reduction act represents a transformative investment in families, workers, businesses, and the planet that will improve health and well-being, advance economic and environmental justice, meaningfully address climate change, and grow our economy while asking the wealthiest and most secure to pay their fair share. as a member of the ways and means committee, i am deeply honored to have played an active role in advancing these policies that improve the health of americans, workers, our economy, and the environment. the pandemic has harmed tens of millions of americans--disproportionately hurting african americans and other communities of color, women, seniors, and children. this bill meets immediate needs for lower costs for health care, medications, and energy as well as long-term needs for good-paying jobs, a healthy environment, a fairer tax system, and deficit and inflation reduction. as a former health care professional, i am proud to vote for this bill that would achieve several important goals in healthcare. the secretary of health and human services (hhs) would have the power to negotiate certain high-cost prescription drugs for seniors and people with disabilities that are medicare beneficiaries. it would enhance premium tax credits, subsidies for people who buy insurance on the affordable care act marketplaces, for three additional years. this is to extend the enacted legislative measure by congress and president biden last year to help people during the covid-19 pandemic. medicare recipients would not have to pay more than $35 per month of their out- of-pocket costs for insulin. drug companies will have to pay a rebate to medicare if their prices increase faster than inflation, and place caps on medicare part d out-of-pocket drug purchases at $2,000 yearly. there will be no copayments for vaccines in medicare part d, medicaid and the children's health insurance program (chip). each of these health provisions directly helps people spend less of their money on healthcare costs and slows the price increases of medicines, giving chicagoans, illinoisans, and americans extra money to meet their needs and improve their well-being. as the representative of communities harmed by high energy costs and pollution, i am proud to vote for this bill that will save the average american household hundreds in energy bills, reduce emissions by 40 percent by 2030, generate enormous public health benefits via reduced air pollution, and grow our clean energy economy by spurring 9 million jobs. i am pleased that this legislation includes my bill, the low-income housing renewable energy credit act (lihrec) of 2021, to provide a larger tax credit for those businesses investing in new wind and solar projects in low-to-moderate income (lmi) communities. i am confident that this provision will help the tax code advance environmental and economic justice by bringing the economic and environmental benefits of solar energy to low-income individuals and communities, spreading the benefits of clean and affordable energy to households like those that i represent that have far too often been neglected by clean energy providers. current renewable tax benefits typically remain out of reach for low-income communities, which also experience greater power- generated pollution. the new provision would provide an enhanced investment tax credit to solar projects benefiting low-income residents, including multifamily housing, community solar homes, and individual low-income residential homeowners. some of the leading companies in this sector have raised the need for additional guidance related to the use of the credit for projects benefiting low-income homeowners to ensure that the program within the reconciliation bill will provide environmental justice allocations in a manner that provide businesses sufficient certainty to make the necessary investments in lmi communities. the central concern is clarity that businesses offering rooftop solar to lmi homeowners will receive the credit allocation prior to engaging with potential customers so that businesses can honestly convey the expected energy costs. critical to the success of this new program will be participation by those businesses providing residential rooftop solar. my intent in drafting the lihrec act, the basis for the provision included in the reconciliation bill, was to ensure that residential rooftop solar businesses would be in a position to leap into service of lmi communities when the bill is signed into law. as such, the legislation is designed to provide maximum flexibility to treasury in designing the application and allocation process for the bonus 10 percent credit. specifically, the legislation is intended to allow residential rooftop providers to identify potential customers in qualifying census tracts and submit applications to serve these customers up-front, before these businesses have engaged these potential customers. my understanding is that these businesses will need to know if they have received a credit allocation before they can offer the benefits of rooftop solar to new customers in lmi areas to provide accurate pricing information to low-income customers. without certainty in the availability of the credit allocation, low-income homeowners are at risk of entering deals with shifting costs or of not having the opportunities at all given the uncertainty for businesses. so today, i make clear my understanding that the negotiated text gives treasury the necessary flexibility to award allocations up-front so that businesses can make new investments in lmi communities knowing that they will be in a position to claim the bonus credit. i also received questions from an insurance company in illinois about whether companies that only prepare what is known as statutory accounting statements would be required to produce gaap statements or a hybrid of gaap. it is my understanding that the legislation provides that applicable financial statements required to be filed with state insurance regulators will be recognized as applicable financial statements for purposes of the new book minimum tax. state insurance regulators already are subject to a robust regulatory financial statement requirement to ensure the continued protection of insurance consumers. after enactment, i will work to convey this understanding to the executive branch. i am honored to vote for this once-in-a-generation legislation. i came to congress to make this type of momentous change. i urge my colleagues to pass it. mr. cuellar. madam speaker, i would like to clarify for any of my colleagues who might be concerned that these three offshore [[page h7702]] lease sales provided through the inflation reduction act are somehow being rushed through or will be conducted with insufficient administrative process. that is simply not the case. these sales were scheduled under the obama administration under the 2017-2022 five-year plan. that interior department subjected the plan to a large programmatic environmental impact statement. they then underwent a multi-sale eis. these sales then also went through a supplemental eis. thus, the idea that any further process should be required is just not credible and that is why the bill requires them to occur by a date certain. it is in our national interest to do so as quickly as possible so that the energy crisis does not become even worse and so that the fuel and revenue these sales will generate can find their way into our economy sooner than later. mrs. dingell. madam speaker, i rise in strong support of the inflation reduction act we are considering today and would like to speak specifically to the inclusion of the greenhouse gas reduction fund, which is based on important legislation i authored to address the climate crisis. the inflation reduction act appropriates $27 billion to the environmental protection agency (epa) to finance climate specific projects that will reduce carbon emissions, which will be dispensed through the greenhouse gas (ghg) reduction fund. the ghg reduction fund is the product of more than 13 years of legislative effort by numerous members of the house and senate and provides resources to fulfill the vision and mission of this legislative effort to capitalize a national climate bank that will support a swift transition to an equitable, clean-energy economy, in the house, the ghg reduction fund is based on h.r. 806, the clean energy and sustainability accelerator act. i introduced this important legislation to provide the maximum funding possible to and capitalize a single independent, non-profit national financing institution (``nnfi'')--the first ever national green bank--that would in turn make its financial and technical resources available to communities across the country. it is our hope, as the administration implements the ghg reduction fund, it will consider the benefits and structure of the clean energy and sustainability accelerator act. it is our hope the environmental protection agency would make awards through the ghg reduction fund to capitalize a single nnfi, as intended under the clean energy and sustainability accelerator act, and for that nnfi to use that capitalization funding to leverage private investment in amounts several times greater than the initial public investment. once capitalized, the bill requires the entity to make direct investments into qualified projects at the national, regional, state, and local levels and, importantly, to make indirect investments into such projects by providing financial and technical assistance to an open, inclusive, and ever-expanding network of state and local nonprofit financial institutions--including existing and newly established green banks and community development finance institutions--that are committed to making investments in the products that will compose the clean power platform on which the economy must run. the ghg reduction fund makes an historic investment into low income and disadvantaged communities as well, mandating that at least 40 percent of the over $20 billion be used to benefit qualified projects and the financing entities that support qualified projects within these communities, but we expect that the full investment in these communities will be far larger through leverage and investments from the remainder of the fund. the ghg reduction fund, and the american people, would benefit most and achieve its purpose most effectively through the capitalization of a single independent nnfi, as originally intended in the clean energy and sustainability accelerator act. a single independent nnfi will not be limited by any jurisdictional boundary--no community is beyond its reach. therefore, the nnfi approach could directly invest in qualified projects anywhere in the united states that would otherwise lack funding. in addition, the nnfi approach can indirectly invest in any community by providing the funding and technical assistance necessary to establish new financial institutions and further capitalize and strengthen existing ones. the nnfi would grow a diverse, open, and inclusive network of state and local green banks and other mission driven financing entities. capitalizing a single independent nnfi at scale, through the ghg reduction fund, would also enable public investment to be leveraged more efficiently which, in turn, drives much greater private capital investment in qualified projects, whether at the national, regional, state, or local level. and the inflation reduction act requires the entity to ``retain, manage, recycle, and monetize all repayments and other revenue'' generated using the capitalization grant. we count on epa to assure that the nnfi will be subject to the appropriate regulations and requirements that would apply to similar non-profit institutions that have been capitalized with federal or nonfederal dollars. at the same time, the relationship between epa and the single independent nonprofit national financing institution should be designed to preserve its operational flexibility and ability to respond quickly to market conditions to execute with the speed that the climate crisis demands. finally, the inflation reduction act sets a 180-day period for epa to complete all these steps: establish the ghg reduction fund, issue a grant solicitation, award capitalization grants, and disburse the funds. these aggressive deadlines were established because the ghg reduction fund cannot achieve its purpose unless the full amount of funds appropriated to this program are put into use through a nnfi approach immediately. disbursing all the funds within 180 days though a single independent nnfi, as originally intended under the clean energy and sustainability accelerator act will ensure that we can expeditiously address the urgent threat of catastrophic climate change, in an equitable manner, on day 181. a swift disbursement of the maximum funding amount possible will allow the climate bank to leverage more private financing--thereby ensuring our public investment has a far reaching impact. the impacts of climate change have created an emergency situation that poses a substantial danger to the health and safety of the american public, and the award and disbursement of the maximum amount of funds appropriated to the ghg reduction fund cannot be delayed. we recognize that the timeline will require epa, at every step in the grant process, to evaluate approaches that can reduce the amount of time that it would otherwise take to complete that step--and it is our intention that epa will utilize all legally-authorized strategies that are necessary to ensure the full amount of the funding is disbursed on time. mr. thompson of california. madam speaker, i strongly support h.r. 5376, the inflation reduction act of 2022. i am particularly pleased that the legislation before the house includes major provisions of my green act, including incentives for a vast array of clean and renewable energy sources. this legislation represents the most sweeping and ambitious climate policy ever to pass the congress. it reduces our dependence on fossil fuels while accelerating the development of solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources. and it incentivizes individuals to limit greenhouse gas emissions from their homes, their businesses, and their vehicles. i am also extremely supportive of the health care provisions in this bill. allowing medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs has been a priority for democrats in congress for decades--and this bill not only ensures that seniors do not go broke paying for their medicines, but also saves taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. given the negotiations of the past 18 months, this bill could not accommodate every single priority or proposal. and i am hopeful that my colleagues will work with me moving forward to ensure that the corporate minimum tax--a policy i support--does not inadvertently burden companies, like some in my district, who suffered severe net operating losses in previous years due to natural disaster. this bill is a tremendous step forward for our country. it pays down our deficit, reduces the cost of prescription drugs, extends health insurance subsidies for low-income americans and invests hundreds of billions of dollars in clean and renewable energy. i am proud to have helped author this legislation, and i strongly support its passage. mr. welch. madam speaker, as many of my colleagues know, i have worked for years to protect patient access to pharmacies across this nation. it is the intent of the united states house that this legislation, and in particular, section 1860d-14c(c). manufacturer discount program shall operate in the same manner as the medicare part d coverage gap discount program found under 42 usc 1395w-114a. cms shall implement this provision to operate in the same manner with respect to a pharmacy. in that way, this section shall not result in any reduction in pharmacy reimbursement or require or permit price concessions or other remuneration from the pharmacy. we will convey this intent to the centers for medicare & medicaid services as they develop the rules that will govern this discount program. i will continue to look for additional ways to help patients and to preserve and protect our pharmacies that are so essential to communities across vermont and our country. ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i rise today in support of a transformational piece of legislation, the inflation reduction act. the inflation reduction act's historic investments will reduce costs for families and individuals, expand access to affordable health [[page h7703]] care, strengthen domestic energy production and manufacturing, and reduce the federal deficit. this plan will also reduce carbon emissions to address the climate crisis and move us toward a better, healthier, and more secure future for oregonians and people across the country. the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic exacerbated longstanding economic inequities, and working families have been facing the consequences. economic inflation caused by increased consumer demand, global supply chain disruptions, and russia's unprovoked invasion of ukraine have shifted global markets, affecting everyday costs. higher prices are straining household budgets and depriving workers of the full benefits of our growing economy. the inflation reduction act will lower costs for health care, prescription drugs, and consumer energy, and make robust investments in energy security and climate solutions, including for disadvantaged and rural communities. in the pacific northwest, climate change is not a distant threat; it is our current reality. the inflation reduction act acknowledges the scale of the climate crisis by investing nearly $375 billion in a clean energy future. it will lower consumer energy costs with clean energy tax credits, and decarbonize every sector of the economy to reduce 40 percent of u.s. carbon emissions by 2030. importantly, the inflation reduction act will invest $60 billion in environmental justice and climate resilient solutions through sustainable agriculture, coastal, home energy, and transportation priorities to bolster rural communities and individuals disproportionately affected by climate change. through economy-wide investments in agriculture, coastal restoration, energy, manufacturing, and transportation, this pivotal legislation will help the u.s. combat climate change while creating new, good paying jobs and mitigating climate inequities. everyone in the united states should have access to quality, affordable health care. to make health care more affordable, the inflation reduction act will extend important health policies passed in the american rescue plan for an additional three years. these policies include eliminating the cap on subsidies for health insurance coverage under the affordable care act, which will benefit up to four million americans. additionally, rising prescription drug costs are a burden for many americans, particularly seniors. too often, excessive drug prices force families to choose between their health and other necessities, like food and housing. that is unacceptable. the inflation reduction act will reduce the price of prescription drugs by allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices for certain medications, and will cap seniors' out-of-pocket costs to $2,000 a year. the bill also caps insulin costs at $35 per month for medicare beneficiaries. the inflation reduction act will stabilize medicare part d by holding annual premium growth to current levels, which will incentivize drug manufacturers and insurers to keep drug prices low. these historic investments will be paid for by making our tax code more progressive, rather than regressive. with the tax provisions in this bill, the very largest corporations, currently contributing as little as one percent in taxes, will pay a minimum rate rather than take advantage of loopholes. after the republicans' 2017 tax bill was signed into law, corporations spent more than $1 trillion on stock buybacks in 2018. the inflation reduction act will help correct the missed opportunities of the so-called tax cuts and jobs act by establishing a tax on stock buybacks. it will also strengthen the internal revenue service to enforce existing tax laws, improve customer service, speed access to tax refunds, and reduce abuse of the tax code. improving tax fairness will bolster domestic investments in our economy while also reducing the deficit. the inflation reduction act makes tremendous progress, but it does not address all of the important priorities of the people of nw oregon and across the country, including needed investments in workforce development and child care. i will continue working on those important priorities, but in the meantime, i look forward to making significant progress by working with my colleagues in congress and partners in the biden-harris administration to pass the inflation reduction act. the
