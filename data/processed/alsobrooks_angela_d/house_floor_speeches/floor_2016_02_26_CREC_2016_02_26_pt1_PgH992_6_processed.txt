[congressional record volume 162, number 31 (friday, february 26, 2016)] [house] [page h992] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] black history month (mr. dold asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. dold. madam speaker, i rise today in recognition and in celebration of black history month. this month is a reminder of both the incredible sacrifices and the remarkable contributions that african americans have made during our nation's history. 153 years ago illinois' own abraham lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation. for 153 years since then, our nation has struggled to overcome bigotry and achieve equality for all. countless courageous leaders have taken up the cause of justice, including former illinois senator everett dirksen and our own colleague here in the united states congress, congressman john lewis. walking on the edmund pettus bridge in selma with congressman lewis for the 50th anniversary of the selma to montgomery marches is one of the highlights of my tenure in the united states congress. as we look back on the accomplishments of the past, we cannot lose sight of the urgency with which we must address inequality in our society today. african americans today face an unacceptable likelihood of being incarcerated, a poverty rate that our nation's leaders should be ashamed of, and everyday discrimination that flies in the face of everything our nation stands for. in memory of the heroes who have fought for equality throughout our nation's history, we are compelled to act. i am committed to fighting for a more just and equal society. i implore my colleagues to do the same. ____________________
