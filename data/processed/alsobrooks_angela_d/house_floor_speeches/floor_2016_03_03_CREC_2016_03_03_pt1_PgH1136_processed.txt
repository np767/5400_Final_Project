[congressional record volume 162, number 35 (thursday, march 3, 2016)] [house] [page h1136] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] women's history month (mr. dold asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. dold. mr. speaker, i rise today to celebrate march as women's history month. as this month is also red cross month, i want to recognize one woman in particular: clara barton. ms. barton was a nurse during the civil war and a teacher before founding the american red cross in 1881. she then served as the organization's first president. her compassion and accomplishments are truly inspiring, and her work has literally helped millions. unfortunately, in our society today, women make up less than 5 percent of ceos and are equally underrepresented in other areas. as a father of two daughters, ensuring that young women can achieve anything that they set their mind to is personal for me. in the 10th congressional district, we run a young women's leadership academy. this program is designed to help young women develop the leadership skills necessary to overcome any and all challenges thrown their way. this unique program gives young women the opportunity to learn from other inspiring female leaders, such as our own colleague, congresswoman elise stefanik, the youngest woman ever elected to the united states congress. i encourage all of my colleagues to start similar programs in their district so that we can all do our part to help inspire young women to become leaders in their chosen fields. of course, this is just a small part of the solution. as we celebrate the inspiring achievements of women this month, we must rededicate ourselves to doing more to tear down barriers and ensure gender equality in our country. ____________________
