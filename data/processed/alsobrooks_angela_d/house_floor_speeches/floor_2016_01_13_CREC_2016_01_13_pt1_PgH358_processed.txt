[congressional record volume 162, number 8 (wednesday, january 13, 2016)] [house] [page h358] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] iran terror finance transparency act (mr. holding asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. holding. mr. speaker, it seems we cannot go more than a few days without the regime in tehran once again making the headlines. from violating u.n. security council resolutions to firing rockets dangerously close to one of our aircraft carriers, to detaining our sailors, iran shows no interest in actually wanting to be part of the international community what is worse, mr. speaker, is that this administration seems all too willing to look the other way, with new sanctions being announced all for the sake of preserving a flawed nuclear agreement. later this month the house will consider again the iran terror finance transparency act, legislation that, in light of iran's recent actions, is absolutely necessary. mr. speaker, now is the time for strong american leadership, leadership that stands up to rogue regimes bent on the destruction of america and our allies. ____________________
