[congressional record volume 162, number 24 (wednesday, february 10, 2016)] [house] [page h656] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] combating bds act of 2016 the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from illinois (mr. dold) for 5 minutes. mr. dold. mr. speaker, in recent years, the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, more commonly known as the bds movement, has been employed as a hateful weapon to delegitimize the state of israel and all those who stand with her. the bds movement has neither brought israelis and palestinians closer to peace nor advanced the laudable goal of improving dialogue between the supporters of both sides. instead, it has served as a means to demagogue israel and inflame tensions in communities and college campuses around our nation. rather than sit back and react to the bds movement's aggressive efforts to foment hatred for israel, it is time to take charge and simply say: ``enough.'' it is time to go on offense against the bds movement's ongoing economic warfare targeting israel. that is why i am proud to announce the combating bds act of 2016, bipartisan legislation that i am introducing with the gentleman from california (mr. vargas), a courageous leader in the anti-bds movement. the combating bds act of 2016 affirms on the federal level the authority of state and local governments to divest public funds or entities that engage in commerce or investment-related boycott, divestment, or sanctions activity targeting israel. here is why this idea is so important. similar to previous local efforts to divest from companies doing business with iran, we are now seeing a growing movement in state and local governments throughout the nation to enact measures to divest public funds from entities participating in anti-israel bds. {time} 1030 the combating bds act of 2016 strengthens these efforts by affirming the legal authority of state and local governments to act on divestment without running afoul of any potential federal limitations. this important legislation empowers community leaders and individuals who seek to counter the hateful targeting and delegitimization against israel, and it sends an unquestionable message about where the united states congress stands on bds. this is not about left versus right. this is about right versus wrong. it must remain bipartisan. as the author of the combating bds act of 2016, i look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this powerful and important legislation. ____________________
