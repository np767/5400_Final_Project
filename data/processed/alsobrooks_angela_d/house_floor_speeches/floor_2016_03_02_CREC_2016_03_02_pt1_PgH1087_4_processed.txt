[congressional record volume 162, number 34 (wednesday, march 2, 2016)] [house] [page h1087] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring coach mike baeb the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from illinois (mr. dold) for 5 minutes. mr. dold. mr. speaker, i rise today to recognize new trier high school wrestling coach mike baeb, who is leaving new trier after helping lead the wrestling program for over 30 years. when he arrived at new trier, he truly injected new life into the program, and i should know because i was a senior on the wrestling team when he came in as a coach. as a senior and the captain of the team, i often had to wrestle coach baeb; and i have to tell you, wrestling coach baeb was like wrestling a bear. unfortunately, i only had 1 year of coaching from mike, and i certainly could have benefited from many more. during his time as coach, mike won 8 central suburban league conference championships, 13 ihsa regional championships, and 7 state place winners. coach baeb has also been a leader, a friend, and a mentor to many students over the past 30 years, all of whom are better off having been under his leadership, and that includes myself. i offer my sincere thanks to coach baeb for his friendship and for his leadership. i wish him all the best in his future endeavors. ____________________
