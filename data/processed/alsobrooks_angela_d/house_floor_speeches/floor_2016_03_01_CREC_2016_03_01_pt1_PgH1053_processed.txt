[congressional record volume 162, number 33 (tuesday, march 1, 2016)] [house] [page h1053] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] rare disease day (mr. dold asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. dold. mr. speaker, yesterday was rare disease day, leap year, and researchers around the world have identified more than 6,000 rare diseases, half of which impact children. last year, the house took a major step toward advancing rare disease research. i was proud not only to cosponsor, but to help pass 21st century cures. 21st century cures is a bill designed to help the world's best scientists find cures for the most deadly diseases that we face. but it is not just the researchers, it is folks like pat livney, who is a friend and an advocate working to help cure charcot-marie-tooth disorder, and folks like jeff aronin and his team working to solve duchenne's disease. mr. speaker, every day, scientists across the country are using nih grants to discover the causes, the symptoms, the treatments, and ultimately search for the cures for rare diseases. in honor of rare disease day, i encourage my colleagues to join me in calling for more funding for the nih this year and every year so that nih can cure many of these diseases and ultimately save lives. and that is just the way it is. ____________________
