to fight for the values that we all hold dear and as we travel sometimes i will run into people and they say you know where are you from or what not and they will say oh josh hawley we wish he were our senator and i was thinking about why that is what is it that makes josh in the job he is doing for us here in missouri so so special and i think the reason is that he fights for us he fights for the everyday american who is doing their level best to support their family to make ends meet to instill the values that we have in our children and we are i am so grateful to him not only as a husband and father but also as missouri senator it is so it is so so good to be here with you we are so excited we are excited to kick off this campaign but let us be honest can i just can i just give it to you straight tonight we have got a lot of work to do because we are here in a moment of crisis for our country our beloved country our great country the greatest country in the history of the world is in crisis tonight as we meet it is in chaos tonight as we meet they are trying to take away our freedom to speak they are trying to take away our freedom to worship they are trying to take away our ability to raise our own children as we see fit they are coming after us after freedom loving americans in every state in every corner of this country and as we stand here right now our southern border a border that every sovereign nation has by the way every sovereign nation has a border they have got our border wide open it is wide open 10 million 12 million 15 million illegal migrants have come across that border just in the last three years and boy do we feel it here in the state of missouri there are drugs there are drugs in every school in this state every single school fentanyl is the leading cause of death for people over the age of 18 where is it all coming from across the southern border we have got the biggest human trafficking ring in american history children as young as my precious little ones here are trafficked into this country where they coming from across the southern border who is making the money the cartels who is running this invasion the cartels and who is letting them the liberals in washington you cannot send your kids out to the bus stop about being afraid of what might happen to them and in our schools my gosh in our schools they are teaching our kids that america is systemically racist is evil is oppressive they are trying to teach our kids that this country was founded in 1619 have you heard that one 1619 when the slave trade started i have got news for these people americans are not an america is not a nation of oppressors america is a nation of liberators we are proud of that we will fight for that we will tell that truth but we are in a moment of severe trial and i just want to be clear about one thing tonight where the responsibility lies for the crisis that we are facing it does not give me any pleasure to say it but we need to be honest we need to be truthful the responsibility for the crisis that we are in lies with the radical democrats and it lies with my opponent lucas coons and his allies who want to force down this country force down our throats radical nutty ideas and policies that are absolutely destroying the united states of america you know what i know it it is why we are here it is why we are in crisis let me just say a word about my opponent lucas coons you may not have had the chance to get to know him yet well let me just tell you a little bit about his record he started running for office 20 years ago now literally 20 and he is a young guy he ran his first campaign when he was 24 years old and he has not stopped then he just runs and runs and runs you know those kind of people i mean just desperate to be in elected office just desperate to be a politician just desperate to be in washington dc where by the way he is lived for most of his adult life in fact he told a newspaper not long ago that he just loved living in washington dc because he said i get to do all kinds of fancy stuff oh really well i tell you what here's some of the other things he is been doing while he is been in washington dc he has been supporting amnesty for every illegal immigrant who comes across suborder amnesty 100% he wants every illegal to get it he wants our borders to be absolutely 100% wide open he is opposed to a border wall he is opposed to enforcing the laws of the border i am not making this stuff up these are his actual policies and it gets even worse than that for all of those illegal immigrants who have come into this country the ones who are taking our jobs who are driving down our wages we have had multiple stabbings in the state of missouri by illegals we have had children literally mone down in cars by illegals we have had assaults we have had murders what is lucas coons and his allies what do they want to do they want you to pay for their health care now i am serious he wants you to take your money your tax money and pay for gold-plated health care and other benefits for illegals now i do not know about you but i think prescription drugs already cost too much how would you like to pay for theirs your health care is not good enough as it is how did you like to pay for theirs you know all i can say is you look at this guy's ideas you look at his policy his record when it comes to the border and it is nuts i mean it is absolutely nuts but that is coons listen it does not stop there his his nicks grand idea his next piece of his record that he is trying to force on the united states of america and on this state lucas coons wants to outlaw all gas and diesel trucks in this state i am serious i mean you cannot make this stuff up anybody drive a pickup truck anybody drive a tractor anybody been in a combine well i hope you enjoy it now because if he is elected you can just turn over your keys right this instant he says that oil and natural gas and the fuels that we produce right here in the united states the fuels that we produce right here in the state of missouri he says those are antiquated outdated outmoded causing climate change and you know who he really blames for all of that you you driving your trucks you driving your combines you driving your tractors and he wants to take all of it away all of it and you think about what that would do to this economy i just think about this business right here i mean it would not exist if you drive a truck for a living you are out of work if you farm if you farm for a living you would be out of work exactly right if you want that kind of thing stores closed jobs lost coons his whole policy his whole policy would make china rich in america poor because where are we going to get our energy if we are not producing it here in the united states where are we going to get it china china he wants us to buy solar panels from china he wants us to buy wind turbines from china he wants us to buy vehicles made in china he wants us to drive electric vehicles made in china and if you think gas costs too much now wait until there is no gas at all which is his policy for this country and for this state i just say again these these ideas are absolutely nutty they are absolutely nutty but it is coons here's something else i think that we have got a number i know a number of law enforcement who are with us tonight and i just want to take a second now let us write i want to take a second now and i just want to say if you are now or you ever have been a member of law enforcement would you just raise your hand so that we can see it and we can honor you thank you sir thank you thank you thank you to the men and women standing around we love you we honor you you know these men and women who put on blue and they put on the badge and they go into danger they run to put their lives in front of ours they run to put themselves in the line of fire they literally take bullets for us i do not know about you but i kind of think that they deserve our respect do you agree with that i kind of think they deserve our support do you agree with that in fact i think they probably deserve a race you agree with that that is how it goes once you know that badge that they wear yeah it says that they have got the authority to enforce the law but here's something else i think it says that badge also says that we support them what that badge says to the crooks and to the criminals and the people who have threatened our children in our streets what that badge says is if you come after one of them we are right behind them what that badge says is we stand together to protect our towns and to protect our communities but here's what lucas coons wants he does not want to protect the badge he does not want to protect our cops he wants to allow criminals to sue the cops let me just say that again he wants to allow criminals to sue the cops do you think that is a good idea are you for that here's what i think we ought to be putting criminals in jail their rights ought to be taken away once they are arrested they do not have the right to assault cops they do not have the right to go after cops and they should it be suing our cops you agree with that my gosh crime crime in this country is absolutely out of control and it is any been in our state it is even come here to our state why because nutty left-wing politicians like lucas coons have been doing things like putting these good cops these men and women who wear blue blue putting them in the line of fire and then just abandoning them leaving them to the criminals do you know that that lucas coons actually said that defunding the police was progress i you said that he said you know it would be a progressive agenda to defund the police yeah right progress for who for the criminals yeah for us no not on our watch that is exactly right and so here we have it again a guy who wants to put the cops on the firing line leave them out there to dry allow the criminals to sue them i do not know about you but i just do not think we can afford that to you so help me out here you know it is nuts but it is it is coons let us try it again all of that it is nuts but it is yeah it is coons it is coons and his buddies i will give you one more i could go on all day i will give you just one more and this one is something that is that is close to my heart and i bet yours because you just met my family do you know that lucas coons he wants to put men in women's locker rooms and he wants to put men into girl sports do you agree with that do you think that is good for our state do you think that is safe for our families i think it is totally insane totally absolutely insane think about this he wants every church and school in this state every one of them to have to say that if a man comes into a woman's bathroom or a woman's locker room or a woman's space you have got to let that man in it does not matter what you believe it does not matter if your church says wait wait wait wait wait wait that is that is not that is not what we believe we want to protect women no he would use the force of law to force you to force you to allow these men and he do the same thing with sports anybody see the olympics recently with that male boxer who who punched out broke the nose of the female i mean he is just he is just destroying the whole sport just think about this this would be every single girl sport in the state of missouri you just met my little girl i think i would like my girl to have the opportunity to play sports i would like her to have the opportunity to get those leadership skills and i would like her to not have a bunch of creepy men following her round in their locker rooms do you agree with that it is just common sense but coons coons not only wants to allow the men into the locker rooms allow the men into women's sports he also wants to allow kindergartners he wants to force the schools to teach kindergartners now kindergartners about quote unquote gender identity that there are not one or two genders there is 200 to 300 in our schools to our kids do you agree with that it is crazy it is absolutely crazy you know it makes me think of a senate hearing i you may have noticed i do not know at these senate hearings i kind of like to ask questions just from time to time one or two little questions somebody has to do it right i remember i remember a hearing not too long ago called by the democrats on women's rights that was the topic of the hearing women's rights now you think we are going to talk about women's rights maybe we would start with the right to be a woman you know to play women sports to have spaces that are for women i mean basic stuff right now that was not it at all in fact their star witness their star witness who was a law professor from the university of california at berkeley oh a woman very smart i will say very intelligent woman very impressive but i noticed during this hearing that she would never say the word woman it went on for like two hours and i was sitting there waiting my turn she would never say woman she kept saying people with a capacity for pregnancy i am serious i wrote that down on my little pad i was like people with a capacity for pregnancy what is that so we finally got to be my turn and i held up my pad and i said i said professor i just want to ask you question when you say people with a capacity for pregnancy do you mean women she looked at me i mean she drew herself up and i will say my mother was a schoolteacher so i know the look she drew herself up i thought i am in trouble i am gonna get it she said senator holly i just want to point out to you the transphobic nature of your question serious this happened now i was not even sure what that meant and i was like transfer i said wait a minute wait a minute because i am asking if women can get pregnant your calling me transphobic you are saying i am a bigot is that is that what you are saying and she said let me ask you a question i said we will sure you go right ahead and she said do you think men can get pregnant now i thought she was joking she was a hundred percent serious so i said uh no i do not and she said see you are a bigot and i said see you are crazy totally crazy it is insane it is insane it is nuts it is nuts and it would be it would be just funny were it not for the fact that these people even as we stand here are forcing it into our schools are forcing these men into our locker rooms are destroying women's sports and they want to do it here and they want to do it in every state in the nation are you for that i tell you what it is nuts but it is it is cones one more time it is nuts but it is it is cones that is what he wants to do listen i have given you only the smallest sample of this guy's track record and what i will say is this for four long years cunes and his allies joe biden and kamala harris and nancy pelosi that is right those people have taken this agenda and they have jammed it down our throats we did not vote for it we did not want it it is not good for this state it is destroying our families it is destroying our economy it is destroying our children and they are jamming it down our throats and this november we have the chance to say no more no more not in this state not in this country so here's the deal i said yesterday after lucas cunes got the democrat nomination he is got to be by the way the nuttiest guy with the nuttiest policies ever nominated by a major party in the state for the senate i made who could you who could you think of who would be even close to it so i said to him i said listen listen how about this how about you and i lucas you and i get on a debate stage the two of us next week in sedalia at the state fair one on one one on one i said listen said about i will bring a trailer it will be lincoln douglas style if it was good enough for lincoln hey it is good enough for us right lincoln douglas style no fancy studio no moderators no filter just you and me will just go back and forth and i said hey listen i will even i will even let you go first you know do you know what he said no he said no exactly he said no he said oh well my gosh no i only want to do it if it is in a tv studio all i want to do it later he wants the temperature to be 71 degrees he wants there to be moderators he wants to be able to wear makeup i mean it is just you cannot make this up so listen i am just if you are watching lucas if you are watching here's the message man quit dancing around quit running away calm to sedalia next week come on thursday at the fair debate me what on one come on come on and we will we will and we will take questions from the crowd you bet one stage two podiums will just go back and forth back and forth i do not think he is going to do it because you know what i think he is afraid of his positions but hey he ought to be thanking me because i am giving him the chance to defend his nuttiness here's the deal we are we are at this moment this inflection point moment in our country's history and i just want to say this i do not know how you feel sometimes you know you wake up in the morning you think my gosh what else could happen in this country i mean what what else could go wrong but i will just say this we may not live in quiet times we may not live in smooth times but we live in times that matter we live in times of consequence and thank the lord for the opportunity to live in a time when the decisions that we make when the choices that we make when the courageous stand that we take matters i do not know about you but i want to be able to say to these little ones over here when they are older and i want to be able to say lord willing to my grandchildren one day that in this time of trial in this time of challenge in this time of need for the greatest country in the history world of the world in this time i did all that i could we did all that we could and this moment of need we saved this country that is our mission that is our agenda that is our mandate so you have got my pledge from now to november i will waste no time i will spend every day fighting to save this country fighting to take our message all across the state of missouri we will leave no stone unturned we will take nothing for granted because we know that the stakes are too high and all i ask is that you and i stand together let me just finish with this you know we hear sometimes about all what is going on in washington and all the solutions coming out of washington solutions do not come out of washington i have been there a few years now they do not come out of washington i tell you where the solutions in this country are they are right here i tell you where the salvation of this country is it is right here the people who are going to save this country are standing right here elbow to elbow right in front of me this is it you are the best hope of america and when the left says that we are deplorables and we are fly over country and we cling to our guns and our gods and our religion i would just say to last point i do guilty of charge but what i say to them is we represent the hope of america we represent both the history of america and the future of america and with god's help we will save america beginning this year god bless you god bless the great state of missouri and god bless america
