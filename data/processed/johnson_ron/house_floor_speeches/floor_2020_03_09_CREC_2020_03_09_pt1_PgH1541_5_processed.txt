(a) in general.--section 101(a)(15)(e)(iii) of the immigration and nationality act (8 u.s.c. 1101(a)(15)(e)(iii)) is amended by inserting ``or, on a basis of reciprocity as determined by the secretary of state, a national of ireland,'' after ``australia''. (b) employer requirements.--section 212 of the immigration and nationality act (8 u.s.c. 1182) is amended-- (1) by redesignating the second subsection (t) (as added by section 1(b)(2)(b) of public law 108-449 (118 stat. 3470)) as subsection (u); and (2) by adding at the end of subsection (t)(1) (as added by section 402(b)(2) of public law 108-77 (117 stat. 941)) the following: ``(e) in the case of an attestation filed with respect to a national of ireland described in section 101(a)(15)(e)(iii), the employer is, and will remain during the period of authorized employment of such irish national, a participant in good standing in the e-verify program described in section 403(a) of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 (8 u.s.c. 1324a note).''. (c) application allocation.--paragraph (11) of section 214(g) of the immigration and nationality act (8 u.s.c. 1184(g)(11)) is amended to read as follows: ``(11)(a) the secretary of state may approve initial applications submitted for aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(e)(iii) only as follows: ``(i) for applicants who are nationals of the commonwealth of australia, not more than 10,500 for a fiscal year. ``(ii) for applicants who are nationals of ireland, not more than a number equal to the difference between 10,500 and the number of applications approved in the prior fiscal year for aliens who are nationals of the commonwealth of australia. ``(b) the approval of an application described under subparagraph (a)(ii) shall be deemed for numerical control purposes to have occurred on september 30 of the prior fiscal year. ``(c) the numerical limitation under subparagraph (a) shall only apply to principal aliens and not to the spouses or children of such aliens.''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from pennsylvania (ms. scanlon) and the gentleman from north dakota (mr. armstrong) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from pennsylvania. general leave ms. scanlon. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from pennsylvania? there was no objection. ms. scanlon. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 2877, a bill to add ireland to the e-3 nonimmigrant visa program. in 2005, soon after the united states and australia finalized the australia-u.s. free trade agreement, congress created the e-3 visa program. that program provides up to 10,500 temporary visas for australian nationals who are pre-approved by u.s. citizenship and immigration services to work in a specialty occupation for a sponsoring united states employer. a specialty occupation is one that requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge in fields such as science, engineering, and research and development in emerging technologies. since the program's inception, australia has only ever used a fraction of the 10,500 e-3 visas that are available each year. for example, in fiscal year 2019, only 5,800 e-3 visas were issued to australian nationals. h.r. 2877 does not increase the number of visas that may be issued, but instead allows irish nationals to use any unused visas. that bill would take the number of e-3 visas that are left unused by australia in a given fiscal year and make that same number of visas available to irish nationals the following fiscal year. this is a commonsense bill that recognizes the important bond we share with two of our country's closest and most steadfast allies. this bill is not controversial, and, in fact, passed the house by voice vote in 2018 when my republican colleagues held the majority in this chamber. mr. speaker, i congratulate my friend, mr. neal, chairman of the committee on ways and means, for continuing to champion this bill. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 2877, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. armstrong. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 2877, a bill to add ireland to the e-3 nonimmigrant visa program. as we approach st. patrick's day, this bill recognizes the unique friendship and working relationship between the united states and ireland. h.r. 2877 allows nationals of ireland to be eligible to apply for unused e-3 nonimmigrant visas subject to ireland providing reciprocal access to u.s. nationals. holders of the e-3 temporary work visa must be working in a specialty occupation while in the united states. a specialty occupation is one that is defined in the immigration and nationality act as requiring: one, ``theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge; and two, ``attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the united states.'' the e-3 applicant must have a job offer from an employer in the united states, and that employer must get a foreign labor certification from the u.s. department of labor prior to filing a petition with u.s. citizenship and immigration services. h.r. 2877 also requires that employers using irish e-3 visa holders in their workforce are, and will remain, participants in good standing in the e-verify program. this means that such employers must use e- verify to ensure those that they employ are eligible to work in the united states. e-3 nonimmigrant visas are currently only available to nationals of australia and are capped at 10,500 per year. [[page h1542]] australian nationals have never used all of the 10,500 authorized visas in a given year, nor have they even come close to doing so. in fact, the highest number used was during the last fiscal year when 5,807 were issued. h.r. 2877 provides that nationals of ireland can utilize the visas not used by australians in a given calendar year. for operational purposes, the visa can be issued for the following year but will be counted against the previous year's cap. so the bill does not increase the number of visas authorized and allows australia, for whose nationals the program was originally created, to have first access to those numbers. mr. speaker, h.r. 2877 is a simple bill that reflects the continued friendship between ireland and the united states. i urge my colleagues to support the bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. scanlon. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. neal). mr. neal. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 2877, to make irish nationals eligible for temporary admission to the united states through the existing e-3 visa program. and i thank the gentleman from north dakota for his offering today and his support. i worked last year with chairman sensenbrenner on this as well. mr. speaker, this legislation has broad support, and last session it passed the congress unanimously. created in 2005 as a result of the u.s.-australian trade agreement-- which i voted for, supported, and spoke in support of--the agreement said, essentially, that the e-3 visa program, as constructed, would make 10,500 visas annually available to skilled australian nationals for temporary work. this program has been a successful pathway for qualified australian citizens to gain valuable professional experience in the united states. however, our australian friends have only used roughly half of the available visas during the past decade. e-3 visas are limited to professionals visiting the united states to perform services in specialty occupations in a confirmed job from a united states employer. e-3 visa applicants also must have a university degree, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the united states. the e-3 visa allows the holder to stay in america for 2 years with the option to renew. this legislation--and i want to make sure that we emphasize this-- this legislation does not change the requirements of the current e-3 visa program recipients or increase the number of visas made available. in broad strokes, my bill will simply enable qualified irish workers to annually access unused australian e-3 visas from the previous fiscal year. once passed, the irish government has pledged to adopt a reciprocal arrangement that would allow americans to work in ireland under the same guidelines. the e-3 visas, combined with these reciprocal arrangements, would provide a welcome and long overdue movement of citizens between ireland and the united states in both directions, which is so important to irish america, the united states, and, indeed, ireland. as many of you in this chamber already know, legal migration between the united states and ireland has been extremely limited now for many, many years. mr. speaker, in closing, i note the support that we have across the united states and unanimously in the congress. it has the backing of both the white house and the irish government, whose prime minister, leo varadkar, the taoiseach, will be welcomed to the capitol on thursday for the annual st. patrick's day luncheon. in my opinion, this bill is a win-win opportunity for the united states and for ireland, and for the citizens of both countries who will benefit from this very innovative and beneficial exchange program. mr. speaker, i thank the committee on the judiciary chairman, jerry nadler, and judiciary's subcommittee on immigration and citizenship chairwoman, zoe lofgren, for swiftly moving this legislation to the floor. and i do take special note of jim sensenbrenner's contribution for helping us get to this moment. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 2877. mr. armstrong. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, the bill is pretty simple. the opening is the closing. this is one of those times where i think common sense prevails. we are not increasing visas. we are continuing a strong relationship between ireland and the united states. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. scanlon. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, once again, i would urge my colleagues to support this bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from pennsylvania (ms. scanlon) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 2877. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________
