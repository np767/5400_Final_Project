washington – on monday, u.s. sen. ron johnson (r-wis.) joined u.s. sen. ted cruz (r-texas) and rep. eli crane (r-ariz.) in a bicameral comment letter in support of a petition by the america first legal foundation to require documentary proof of u.s. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. “requiring documentary proof of citizenship is a simple, common-sense reform. just as americans are asked to show identification for far less consequential activities—boarding an airplane, opening a bank account, or even attending certain events—it is entirely reasonable to require proof of citizenship to participate in our elections. this step would not burden eligible voters but would provide an essential check to ensure that only citizens are added to the voter rolls,” the senators said. “requiring documentary proof of citizenship will strengthen the integrity of our elections, safeguard the voices of american citizens, and ensure that every lawful vote is protected from being diluted by unlawful ballots,” the senators concluded. sens. johnson, cruz and rep. crane were joined by u.s. senators ted budd (r-n.c.), jim banks (r-ind.), roger marshall (r-kan.), cindy hyde-smith (r-miss.), john cornyn (r-texas), marsha blackburn (r-tenn.), and bernie moreno (r-ohio). full text of the letter can be found here . ###
