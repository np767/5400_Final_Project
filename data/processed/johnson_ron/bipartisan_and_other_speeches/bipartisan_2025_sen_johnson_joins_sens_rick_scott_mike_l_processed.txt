washington – today, u.s. sen. ron johnson (r-wis.) joined u.s. senators rick scott (r-fla.) and mike lee (r-utah) in introducing a resolution opposing reckless spending in congress. this resolution “affirms the need for congress to reign in overspending to help curb the inflation crisis that is crippling the families of the united states,” the senators wrote. “as senator tom coburn used to say, earmarks are the gateway drug to continued massive deficit spending and the mortgaging of our children’s future. our nation is $38 trillion in debt — america cannot afford irresponsible spending habits. the root cause of so many of our problems is the size, scope, and cost of the federal government. eliminating earmarks is a step in the right direction,” sen. johnson said. full text of the resolution can be found here . ###
