senator kirsten gillibrand is jumping into the 2020 race for president earlier today the democratic hopeful spoke alongside her family in her hometown of troy, new york. i am going to run for president of the united states because as a young mom i will fight for your children as hard as i would fight for my own and that is why i believe that healthcare should be a right and not a privilege. i believe we should have better public schools because it should not matter what block you grow up on. i believe we need to start rewarding work in this country again because anybody who wants to work hard should be able to get whatever training they need to earn their way into the middle class and to be able to have the american dream which has always been for everyone. well senator gillibrand joins a growing list of democratic 2020 hopefuls that already includes several women with more insight. we are now joined by cbsn political reporter caitlin huey burns. good to see you. hey good morning. so what i find really fascinating about gillibrand's launch of her candidacy on the colbert show last night and today in her hometown is that she is spent a good portion of her time supporting female candidates across the country and we saw what happened in the midterm elections where we saw a record number of women running a record number of women winning and here as the center or the central focus of her campaign is gender. she launches the campaign. she announces to colbert yesterday that she is a mom and she cares about kids and we were talking earlier about how sometimes in the past perhaps a generation earlier of women sought to distance themselves from their womanhood mom and all that. they talked about their kids and their family but it was more about i can do the job just like you do because i am just like you the man and now you are seeing something different. right because we saw a really you know flood of women candidates running in 2018 you mentioned that gillibrand campaigned for a lot of them. she has her own pack dedicated to helping to not only promote but to help fund women running for office and she is not the first woman to enter the 2020 fray. elizabeth warren is already in this race but she is also not going to be the last. they are expected to be a few others potentially two more senators. so this is going to be an unprecedented number of women running for president this cycle but gillibrand really is the first so far to carve out a niche in this very crowded field becoming more crowded by the day it seems as someone who is kind of staking her claim as you know on gender on the issue of promoting women. remember in last year she led the charge to oust senator al franken from office. so she took a lot of flat from that. she got criticism but also praise but also praise and it kind of exposed a little bit of a generational divide within the party and so she is very much kind of you know embracing that talking about what she is learned from that and you know pointing to that as as a as a credential of sorts as she runs and she even in that same period was asked about former president bill clinton and she you know admitted that perhaps she was wrong to have sort of supported his point of view with regards to the lewinsky scandal and that for a lot of people again it is the same thing people say you are sort of you know you are walking back what you said earlier but she thought that it was the right thing to do and it was certainly a political risk because it seems like that is where the party was moving that is certainly what the energy from the base was was talking about but you had you know some some outrage from donors which are also critical to this process. what else she said today is what we are hearing from other democratic candidates that they are not taking super pac money they are not taking money from corporate pacs they want this campaign to be raised by money from the people and have a more democratic lower d process and so that is going to be another interesting kind of issue to follow. so you have been covering congress for quite a while and i want you to explain to our viewers track a little bit of her ascendancy to in politics i mean she started out as sort of a moderate democrat and she is moved progressively left. she did because she represented she started out as a moderate democrat even a conservative democrat because she represented one election in her in a district in near albany that was very red and so she actually is kind of using that as a credential now she is going to be you know to as an electability argument even though she is espousing pretty liberal views she also says that you know she has the ability to win in in areas that are different from that are that are rather more conservative but you know that record will come under scrutiny she had much more conservative views on things like immigration on guns that have changed as she came to the senate now in interviews and even today she has said that those views changed because when she was representing you know larger new york talking to families in brooklyn affected by gun violence for example and immigration that those views evolved and she has very much owned up to that but that does not mean that it will come under scrutiny especially since there are so many other candidates running in this race so how much is she expecting to i mean i mean can she win without expanding beyond just the the fact that women are voting in record numbers now i mean and i get that there is a sense from her that that is a going to be a key constituency of hers unlike elizabeth warren i think elizabeth warren will certainly capture some of that as well but she is not made an essential focus of her campaign she is not talking about it the way that jill brand is talking about it and elizabeth warren actually so far has not been talking about donald trump right the way that jill brand talked about donald trump today and when i was in iowa a couple weeks ago i was asking voters kind of what they were looking for in a candidate we know it is very early on in this process but the theme i heard over and over again was that they wanted someone who can defeat donald trump now they do not know exactly what that is going to be like they do not know what kind of candidate they think can do that but we are going to see democrats running in different ways with that in mind at some level whether it is on rhetoric whether it is on behavior whether it is on policy drawings contrast that are clear to voters making that electability argument jill brand was also trying to make that today and she is pointing to her record in the senate there are going to be lots of senators running in this race all having records to run on all having records that will be under scrutiny she was saying that she has proven that she is been able to get things done what will it look like we have already got you know gathered we have got warren now jill brand we expect perhaps at some point kamala harris will announce this is going to be unprecedented we have never faced this and it will be interesting i think caitlin to watch how for example the male candidates respond to the me too movement and to the times up and how they address it when some of them are asked all of them are asked about former president bill clinton when they are asked about out frank and when they are asked about you know are we want to see who has supported liberal causes in the past how they respond to that and we will also be interesting to watch a dynamic amongst themselves i mean because it is going to be sort of historical absolutely and i think when you know during the outsting of senator franken there was kind of a strategy at play that democrats thought that they were able to claim the moral high ground remember this was during the roy moore and alabama issues so they believe that they are ahead of republicans on the issue but they are still certainly still some internal debate but this is a very diverse field you had a julian castro get in over the weekend he is probably the only latino running in this race but you have a variety of different women and there is this question about after 2016 because you have seen this influx of women interested in politics participating in politics at a level we have not seen before and voting whether the party needs to or feels like it needs to promote a women to this office because they have not been able to crack what hillary clinton has called the hardest glass ceiling so finally i guess you know elizabeth warren has national recognition in part because she is been on the stage for quite a while and of course because president trump has mocked her jill brand has also been on the national stage for quite some time tulsi gabbard hawaii i mean like it is a state obviously and but it is far away from most mainlanders the issues that sometimes affect the mainland do not affect hawaii who is tulsi gabbard what is she bringing to the table what makes her unique what what makes her think that she can gain on some of these others including the men who have had already national exposure federal office federal appointments for example right well a couple different things she is a congresswoman and she is a veteran but she has raised a lot of alarm bells within the democratic party for various positions especially her you know visit to syria yeah very strange very strange very controversial so i am curious to see what her constituency will be but i think it does speak to the idea that a lot of democrats right now are eager to take on donald trump they sense vulnerabilities and they also feel why not me and why not now there is no frontrunner really in this race and it is very interesting because we talk a lot about joe biden whether he will get in there has not been really anybody who has been able to clear the field or whose presence would clear the field you are seeing a lot of people sees this opportunity and figure now is a good time to at least explore the possibilities you know you bring up joe biden and the former vice president and i wonder would he be somebody that would clear the field i feel like in the way that things are shaping up right now that he as respected as he is might be kind of a relic of a bygone era but he has those blue collar you know bonafides that maybe enough to it is it is it is a really big it is a really big question and what he wants his legacy to be because as we know he is very popular now so is hillary clinton before she announced she was among the most popular public office holders which was was very notable we saw what happened in terms of public opinion so that is certainly a risk but you know he has not cleared the field because you still have lots of people getting in you still have people like cory booker kamala harris as you mentioned amy klobuchar another senator from minnesota talking about this race making the steps to to get in at some point soon so he has not cleared the field yet and you know i have asked different strategists and party chairs about this and they say that this kind of speaks to the way in which democrats want to have a debate about the party and they want to have show their diversity and their bench i think it is really interesting to see this sort of the first group of people that are you know going for the brass ring and especially gathered because as i said you know hawaii's got some very specific interests and as a congresswoman for that state she will bring a perspective that i do not think a lot of people here in the mainland have heard about ways that she is been able to serve her constituents in her in her district so it will be really exciting why everybody loves hawaii i know i know i want here to go i know exactly you you want to go cover what she is an out which is announcing you will go and it will be great i will follow along with you anchor from there for a couple of days thank you caitlin is always thank you
