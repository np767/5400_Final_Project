[congressional record volume 162, number 8 (wednesday, january 13, 2016)] [house] [page h335] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 0915 congratulations to the seattle seahawks (mr. ellison asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) mr. ellison. mr. speaker, i take the floor today to congratulate the fans of the seattle seahawks. you see, i talked with my good friend congresswoman suzan delbene and told her that the minnesota vikings were for sure going to beat the seahawks. =========================== note =========================== january 13, 2016, on page h335, the following appeared: you see, i talked with my good friend congresswoman susan delbene and the online version should be corrected to read: you see, i talked with my good friend congresswoman suzan delbene and ========================= end note ========================= she said: well, if you really believe that, why do not you agree to come down to the house floor if they do not, and i will come down to the house floor if they do. for three quarters, i was right, mr. speaker. the vikings shut the seahawks out completely. but in the fourth quarter, through luck--and this is the real skill of the seahawks, by the way--the center throws one over the head of the quarterback. the quarterback runs 20 yards back. it looks like he is just going to fall on it, but he picks it up, finds an open man, hits him, and then the guy almost scores, and then, on the next play, they do. then, after that, the leading rusher in the nfl, a.p.--adrian peterson--drops a pass and fumbles it and then they get the ball and kick a field goal. we are now 9-10. even still, the vikings were about to win, mr. speaker, but the lucky, lucky seahawks saw our excellent field goal kicker miss one, although he has been making them all year long. so i am here to congratulate the seahawks as the luckiest team in the nfl. ____________________
