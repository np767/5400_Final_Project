[congressional record volume 162, number 7 (tuesday, january 12, 2016)] [house] [pages h285-h286] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] wasp arlington inurnment restoration act the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california (mr. denham) for 5 minutes. mr. denham. mr. speaker, i rise to discuss the contributions the wasps have made to our great country. these are the women airforce service pilots, and they represent an elite group of female pilots. they flew combat missions during world war ii. these women displayed courage, valor, and a willingness to serve, and they made invaluable contributions to our nation's efforts to battle on the world stage. there were fewer than 1,100 wasps, and 38 of them died during their service. but because the unit was created in 1942, the wasp group was never granted full military status. in 1977, congress retroactively granted active-duty status to these brave pilots to ensure that all va policies, laws, and services would apply to them; yet, the army recently denied the request of wasps who were seeking a place in arlington national cemetery. they say they are running out of space. this decision flies in the face of our nation's efforts to recognize, reward, and treat honorably the contributions of all of our veterans. these women deserve the same honor that is bestowed upon hundreds of thousands of their fellow servicemembers. so i urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring and supporting the bill. [[page h286]] i say this to the va: find the space. ____________________
