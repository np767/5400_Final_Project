[congressional record volume 162, number 5 (friday, january 8, 2016)] [house] [page h180] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] planned parenthood (mr. cohen asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) mr. cohen. mr. speaker, yesterday, this house unfortunately passed a bill to basically repeal the affordable care act and do away with funding for planned parenthood. i know the president will veto that bill, and i want to thank him in advance. in tennessee, 236,000 people signed up for the affordable care act. that is 236,000 people who, if the bill becomes law, will not have health care or will have more expensive health care. nationally, 11 million people signed up. those people will not have it or will have more expensive health care. if you stop planned parenthood, you stop poor people, many of whom are in my district, from getting preventive health care: mammograms, hiv testing, and planned birth control programs. this was a bad bill against the people of our country, taking away health care from people who need it, otherwise cannot afford it, and otherwise would not get it. thank you, mr. president. ____________________
