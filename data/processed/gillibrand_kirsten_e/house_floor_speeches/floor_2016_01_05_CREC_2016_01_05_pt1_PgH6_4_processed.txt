[congressional record volume 162, number 2 (tuesday, january 5, 2016)] [house] [page h6] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] making america safer (mr. cardenas asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. cardenas. mr. speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to be a member of this house and to be elected in a wonderful, beautiful economy in the greatest nation on the earth. the year 2015 has expired. we have just begun this session in 2016. but the question, ladies and gentlemen, is: what are we going to do to serve the public? what are the things that we are going to focus on to make sure that our constituents are safer so that we continue to provide a democracy that is an example for other countries? we have heard just in the first few minutes of these speeches about how we need to make america safer. well, one way that we can do that is to do our job so that the executive of our country does not have to try to do whatever he can to extend his responsibilities because we are not doing enough. there are too many moments of silence, ladies and gentlemen, where 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 americans are killed through senseless violence, and we have done almost nothing about it as a congress. ____________________
