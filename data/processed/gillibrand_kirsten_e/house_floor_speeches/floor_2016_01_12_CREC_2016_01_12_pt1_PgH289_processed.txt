[congressional record volume 162, number 7 (tuesday, january 12, 2016)] [house] [page h289] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] pro-life the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas (mr. ratcliffe) for 5 minutes. mr. ratcliffe. mr. speaker, the declaration of independence contains a passage that every student in america learns at an early age. it explains that each of us are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, chief among them the right to life. this highlights and reminds us just how much our founders valued the right to life. as an elected representative, the words in our declaration that follow are equally compelling: to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men. how often we forget that government exists first and foremost to secure the right to life. now, this is an immense responsibility, one that i take very seriously, because one of the highest honors i have in representing the fourth congressional district of texas is defending the most vulnerable among us, our unborn children. i am proud to have a voting record that reflects my unwavering commitment to protecting unborn life and ending taxpayer funding of abortion. i will also be the first to tell you that legislators represent only one piece of the puzzle in the ongoing and vital effort to promote a culture of life. there are literally thousands of unsung pro-life heroes in the fourth congressional district of texas, whose effort to promote a culture of life are not about gaining recognition or notoriety, but are simply rooted in an abiding sense of protecting the inalienable right to life, which our founding fathers spoke of. i would like to take this opportunity to recognize a few of these pro-life heroes in my district, people like melanie grammar and deborah butts with the texas federation of republican women; michelle smith and ann hettinger in rockwall, texas; chip adami at the true options pregnancy center in sherman; mason randall and robin stevenson at lake pointe church adoption ministry; kristie wright at the first choice pregnancy resource center in texarkana; threesa sadler and tim stainback at the raffa center in greenville; joanne vuckovic at the rockwall pregnancy resource center; and the great folks at both the paris and fannin pregnancy care centers. the dedication of individuals like these and thousands of others across the fourth congressional district of texas is appreciated, it is necessary, and it certainly does not go unnoticed. thank you all for your commitment to protecting the incredibly important cause of life. ____________________
