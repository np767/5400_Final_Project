[congressional record volume 170, number 17 (tuesday, january 30, 2024)] [house] [page h281] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] lng exports (mr. rose asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. rose. mr. speaker, president biden opened another front in his ongoing war against american energy by halting all pending approvals of liquified natural gas, or lng, export terminals based on the so-called climate crisis. when president biden takes such drastic action to kneecap an american industry like liquified natural gas, he paralyzes job growth, innovation, and future sustainability research and development in america. instead, he offshores this progress to the middle east, russia, or south america, all while raising americans' energy bills, fueling inflation, and destroying good-paying american jobs. president biden's job-killing new green deal agenda cannot continue. for every woke action he takes, americans suffer the consequences. house republicans are fighting back by passing legislation to grow energy industry jobs and bring back energy independence to america. we stand firmly on the side of most americans who prefer an all-of-the- above energy strategy for our country in which all forms of energy are pursued. ____________________
