[congressional record volume 169, number 22 (thursday, february 2, 2023)] [house] [pages h634-h635] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] it is time to get back to work (mr. rose asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) [[page h635]] mr. rose. mr. speaker, today, i rise to express my support for h.r. 139, the show up act, which was introduced by my good friend from kentucky, the chairman of the committee on oversight and accountability, mr. comer, and passed on this floor yesterday. millions of tennesseans show up to work every day. however, more than half of federal government workers, who are expected to serve the american people, still are not showing up for work. this has led to extremely long wait times and delays in services. veterans who showed up to work and served our country cannot get their proper va benefits. families are waiting months for their passports. in my district, a father waited for more than 8 months to receive his tax return. the entire time, he was left in the dark by the irs. tennesseans deserve better, mr. speaker. the pandemic is over, and it is time to get back to work. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support like-minded measures. ____________________
