[congressional record volume 170, number 17 (tuesday, january 30, 2024)] [house] [page h278] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] articles of impeachment against secretary mayorkas the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from tennessee (mr. rose) for 5 minutes. mr. rose. mr. speaker, after nearly a year-long and thorough investigation by the house committee on homeland security, house republicans have released articles of impeachment against department of homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas for his willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law and breach of the public trust. as many of my fellow tennesseans know, for quite some time now i have fully supported the house's efforts to examine whether secretary mayorkas has committed an impeachable offense. now, after an investigation into the causes, costs, and consequences of secretary mayorkas' actions that have exacerbated this historic humanitarian crisis at our southern border, the time has come to officially release articles of impeachment. according to the house committee on homeland security, dhs secretary mayorkas is ``chiefly responsible for the chaos and devastation that has unfolded over the past 3 years'' at america's borders and ports of entry. the committee has found that secretary mayorkas violated his oath to support and defend the constitution of the united states by willfully and systemically refusing to comply with federal immigration laws. he has also acted in a manner subversive of the law. these subversive actions and willful negligence of our country's laws have led to an unprecedented level of illegal immigration at our southern border and ports of entry, a fentanyl crisis killing thousands of tennesseans, and skyrocketing financial costs on the u.s. taxpayers. that is why the first article of impeachment being released is titled, ``willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law.'' the second article of impeachment being released is titled, ``breach of public trust.'' as a cabinet official and someone in the line of succession to the presidency, the american people must trust secretary mayorkas to say and do the right thing. unfortunately, he has done exactly the opposite. he has knowingly made false statements about his refusal to comply with the law and the impact his decisions have had. {time} 1030 he has even obstructed the committee's work to save the american people from this catastrophe. we must take all national security threats seriously and after a thorough, fair, and comprehensive investigation into secretary mayorkas, remaining in his position is a threat to our national security. not only has he willfully ignored his constitutional duty to defend our country and breached the public trust, but he has also demonstrated an unwillingness to change course or correct his mistakes. one could only presume that he would continue to be a threat to the health of our nation, its security, and our constitution. americans deserve better than what they are getting. every town in america does not have to be a border town. we must exercise our constitutional duty and hold secretary mayorkas accountable to our best abilities. it is, therefore, my sad but straightforward duty to vote for his impeachment and support his removal from office. ____________________
