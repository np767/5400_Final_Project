[congressional record volume 169, number 18 (friday, january 27, 2023)] [house] [page h435] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 0915 republican economic scheme hurts working families (ms. brown asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) ms. brown. mr. speaker, i rise today to urge the extremists in this chamber to stop playing political chess with the lives of working people and families. in 2021, 85 percent of americans over the age of 50 opposed cuts to social security and medicare to reduce the national debt. clearly, the economic scheme proposed by the gop is in direct opposition to the people's will: slashing social security and medicare for the working class while giving tax breaks to the wealthy. the gop scheme also proposes a ridiculous 30 percent--yes, 30 percent--national sales tax, a huge setback for working families, increasing the cost of everyday essentials and raising gas prices. as if that was not enough, this scheme is holding the reputation of our nation hostage to extremist demands for cuts to social security and medicare. democrats stand with the people. dismantling medicare and social security will never be up for debate. ____________________
