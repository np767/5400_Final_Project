[congressional record volume 169, number 18 (friday, january 27, 2023)] [house] [page h472] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1300 women's access to medication abortion (ms. ross asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) ms. ross. mr. speaker, i rise today to defend women's access to medication abortion. in the wake of the dobbs decision, the justice department reaffirmed that states cannot ban the abortion pill, which now accounts for the majority of abortions nationwide. medication abortion is safe and effective. it is healthcare. however, in north carolina, women face unnecessary limitations that not only allow treatment to be delayed by 72 hours but require counseling before medication abortion. this week, a brave physician in north carolina, amy bryant, filed a lawsuit challenging these dangerous restrictions. let us be clear. any state that limits a physician's ability to prescribe abortion medication is causing harm to women and creating needless barriers to healthcare. we cannot give up on the fight for full reproductive autonomy. ____________________
