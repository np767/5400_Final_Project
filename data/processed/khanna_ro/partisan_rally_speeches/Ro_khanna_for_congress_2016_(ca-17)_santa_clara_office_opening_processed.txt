hi everyone, well thank you so much for coming out tonight. i am astounded at how many people are here and how many people are interested in this campaign so we really appreciate you coming just a little background on me. i worked for a bay area member in washington dc and part of the reason that i genuinely believe in roe and believe in getting him to congress is that i think we need some new new blood in dc some new ideas we have had some amazing leaders come out of the area but i think it is time to get someone new and get somebody who is ready to kind of change things up a little bit so i really believe in roe i hope that you know we can all get out there and get the word out on him because i know everybody here believes in him too and i was just gonna take a second and kind of tell you guys how far and wide reaching this campaign is i know a lot of our staffs coming from places like new york we are lucky enough to get erica out of dc myself coming from north carolina we all have our individual reasons why we are actually out and we are supporting roe whether it be the focus on stem education so so many other things i mean down to just to actually trying to tackle some of the traffic congestion i love the breadth to this platform, but myself personally it is not just the fact that i actually am very excited for someone to really focus on restructuring student debt, which is something that is very important to me but also what made me get up and leave my home state and come out to california to make sure that we can get roe in office is because of the change that this campaign is gonna bring one thing super important to me is the fact that we are not taking pack this is a entirely grassroots driven campaign and that is something that i hope everyone in here knows how special that is that is not something that you are seeing and not only other congressional races throughout the country, but any race really anymore this is something that we are taking a stand on and this campaign hopefully not to get roe in office so that we can kind of plan a seed and grow further change in congress and finally get things moving again but also set the model and show other candidates across the country that this can be done you can challenge and incumbent you can make change happen by coming together so again, i just want to welcome everyone and say thank you thank you for the support for the campaign. thank you for being out tonight and we will go ahead and get to some great introductions and get some people out here i got a new slogan for you field the role so i would like to introduce i am sorry i was in the back sorry, how did you put down my case? i want to thank all of you for coming here because this the great city of santa clara this is a great place for roe to be i even like you being in this building because you are downtown and this is a great place for you to be and welcome to our city absolutely um to all you young people this man is an inspiration to all of you i want you to get out there and beat those doors with brass ones that is how you make things you get out there you walk you talk and not taking that money gives you a stronger hold and to do well basically to get what you would done as a policymaker you do not have to worry about somebody be holding to what you want and to get your message through so bottom line bro. thank you. i came here to support you and thank you to come to my city of santa clara and it will be out there being the drums for you and i hope that everybody in this room takes us very seriously he needs to be there. it is time for a change it is 16 years of the same old same old it is time to get up there people and speak your word not going to doors convince everybody if you can bring in five people i know aj you are gonna do your best are not you sweetheart thank you so let us hear it for rokana thank you so much to those remarks it gives me a huge honor to be able to introduce not only a huge supporter of row but a huge cheerleader for the city we are in right now santa clara so uh tells woman lisa go more if you will come up and say if you words for us as well. excuse me. thank you so much. i will turn it over to you my suitcase is not as big as debbie thank you for all of you for being here this evening. this is a special place for me my family goes back a few generations here in santa clara and my grandfather have a store in the old downtown which was knocked over with redevelopment but um we go back generations and in this place and look on these grounds across the street and here in the franklin wall many many many political campaigns have started and future politicians have come out of these out of these walls these lovely franklin walls so we are so happy to have row here we are gonna take credit for you beautiful franklin mom santa clara that that is grown the most wonderful congressman of all time so um we we are gonna do that i am really happy and excited probably a lot of you read that we have some issues going on in santa clara right now and they really stand around integrity honesty openness and transparency in government and i think that i know councilwoman davis and i have been fighting really hard for those kinds of things and we see these qualities in row i mean, they are so evident that he is the unpoliticians politician he is a straight talker a straight shooter and someone that we believe we can trust and stand behind and say that he is the one for us um what struck me as funny is um saturday night. we had a big concert at santa clara university uh huey lewis in the news played and the city sponsored it debbie. now you enjoyed ourselves. we danced all night um but but we had our our mayor. i mean our former gone on stage and with the council and he was dragging along the southern man who is our congressman right now and he was introducing him to our community and he is been our congressman for 16 years and people do not know him. he is introducing him and it just goes to show that our city of santa clara that we think is so important he does not we have not seen him in 16 years but you know what this gentleman row conna he came when we had a little soccer issue with the 49ers he was there speaking for us and standing up for us when we had a library that needed to be open north of bayshore there is robe congressman who no row was there helping us and just lately we had a little thing we have all this development going on in the city and we have people that do not want to pick park fees but you know what? row was there speaking for our park fees he did not have to do that. he did not have to do that um, he is not taking pack money neither are debbie and i and for different reasons no one will give us any pack so why are we been acting? okay, we have been acting. we are not getting any pack money but hey, but we still have that in common but i am gonna end this by saying i am so happy you are here. i am proud that you are here you are in the hardest santa clara everyone that is gonna meet you here from the old quad and comes down for farmers market they are gonna get to know you and they are gonna love you as much as we love you so good luck row. we are here behind you and finally i want to introduce rose right wife good evening everyone on behalf of my self, i want to thank you all for being here. it is a great turnout it is great for us to see the excitement and commitment that people have to the campaign um, i for one i am really excited that we are opening the office because as many of you know, row and i just recently got married in august um, and i moved out here in september so during the last campaign, you know, i would come out and visit and he was campaigning and going to all kinds of stuff but one of the things i really enjoyed was when we would stop by the office and spend time there um, and the reason was because it is it is sort of where people would gather and make phone calls or mon tears would kind of start their day together or start their shifts and this is an energy there, and i think that is a really exciting part of a campaign so much of the campaign of course happens spread out throughout the community as it should every time you are not gonna door or talk to one of your neighbors about what rose doing but it is it is kind of exciting when there is a concentrated effort in one space and i think it really creates the energy and excitement that the campaign needs and keeps going so it is a lot of fun for me when i would come out i cannot really have a chance to do that and i hope now that i am living here in the bay area i will be able to spend more time in the office and and to know the volunteers better i will admit that i am still finding my way around and i have gotten to know the fremont area i do not know the santa clara area clara area as well and i think this is going to be an opportunity for me to spend some time and explore this this part of town so i am looking forward to that um but i am just really excited really excited for the energy that is here and for what is going to happen in this in this space over the coming months. i think i can i sort of you know it looks the way it does now, but i can i was talking to brian and i can envision what it is gonna look like in a few months when people are in here and working and really trying their best and you know you see people of all ages and all backgrounds that come into this space together and are sitting elbow to elbow with someone that they would never meet or that they would never work with but they have a common goal and they are excited about the campaign and they are excited about the values that ro has and so they find something to to work on together. so it is really exciting but again, thank you everyone for being here and for everyone who is put time into getting the office ready um, and now i will give you the row thank you thank you it was it was rithus birthday yesterday, so great having her and what a great great turnout um, let me just say about first debbie davis debbie and i were friends before politics and we had a long conversation about how she grew up how i grew up both both on the east coast but both to families that cared about the country there is a sense of patriotism a sense of growing up in the middle class and she ran such an extraordinary campaign when she ran from nowhere i mean was not part of the old boys' clobbit was not part of the endorsed folks and crushed everyone because and then i said how does she do that and i realized that well she is quietly volunteering in every part of the community not putting her name out there not doing actually going and doing the work and it made me realize that voters in santa for a very smart to elect someone like her you are lucky to have her and i am excited to work with you for many years to come. thank you debbie for being here and i just want to make it very clear i mean we lisa lisa gilmore is someone i admire and i know the mercury news and some reporters are here let me be very very clear lisa gilmore should be the next mayor of santa clara i say that not because it is evident to have a lot of santa clara that she has and the the generations of gilmore's that have served the community and we are so lucky to be in the heart santa clara with this office but it is because lisa you know there are two types of politicians political leaders if you have had years of public service. there is a types of become content and say okay. i am just gonna preserve the status. well that is a easy way because you have got name recognition you get elected and you stay there and then there the folks are saying i am actually going to take all that good will and stand up for what is right and pick fights for people and not the special interest and lisa has done that time and time again with such courage with such integrity she is a role model santa clara so desperately needs her and i am there for her for whatever she does because she is an exceptional public service. so thank you lisa i am gonna be brief in my remarks, but if you will indulge me if i can recognize a few folks because this is like a family and there've been so many people here who have made this office opening in our campaign possible my chair steve spinner he is not often in the background, but he has been the given his life to the campaign for almost four years uh campaign team this time and and what i am so impressed with is that is there you have really uh taken to the community and been part of the community and engaged in the community with brian harvey or campaign manager and character or political record sam who is are from free a regional director in freemont chris, i think i saw him in sunnyvale kevin fox was in in santa clara and he is gotten to really know the community and then any i do not know if eddie is here gary lives in sunnyvale, but is is helping in elite in cupertino they have been extraordinary in in their efforts and i hope you will all get to work with that so let us give them a round of applause i probably a community leaves i could single out everyone here, uh, but you know chris nichols was there in the very beginning if patty picard i you must know this this and everyone he sent a tweet out. it is like the whole what is going on so i appreciate everything you have done ben manure who was there when i had the crazy idea of running in the first place and linda and tom and and there is so many folks it is daisy true here. i have daisy daisy has been an extraordinary friend and i appreciate your not being going to to sacramento to stay here and thelma and thank you for your expo leadership and david wessel of the the sunnyvale democratic club i hesitate to do this because kai because you leave people out, but i just wanted to say the the brian dowe and jp thank you then the the i will try to get to everyone but the campaign has been a family it has it has been a people say you know when i when we lost a very close race at 48.2% if people like andy raderman and others and horses last time and we lost people said oh of course he is gonna run again. of course. he is gonna run again but it is not it is not that simple for people who are you know when you run and put your heart out into something you do not make it these campaigns take a lot out of you and ritzo and i remember we went to ihoff for the day after the election you know, i love chocolate chip banana pancakes and you know we have these pancakes and we are talking and and and honestly it was not clear what i was going to do. i mean there was but we i was inundated with emails. i mean when the cell and i were emailing midnight and and she was doing all of these emails over people saying look you you got to keep going you have got to keep fighting for the community you got to keep at at what you are doing this is not just about your campaign. it is about a movement that we have started and to me this campaign is so important because we are at such a important time in our country's history there is an anxiety out there. i mean anyone who saw the new hampshire results knows there is a anxiety that the country then i grew up in my parents immigrated from india for country where it you work hard you study hard you make good grades. you are gonna have a shot at the american dream that basic idea is being questioned the folks are thinking that the game is right that they may work hard. they may study hard, but they may not have a shot at the american dream for the first time in our country's history think about that for the first time people are worried whether the young folks here whether your generation is going to have a better life than the previous generation that is never happened before and there are two ways to deal with that anxiety one is to appeal to people's fears to say you know middle class is struggling people are not getting work let us blame people. let us blame immigrants. let us blame the global economy. let us blame folks who are doing well but my view is is that going to solve the problem? is that going to get someone who is studying at wilcox was studying at independence a shot at the american dream? is that going to create an american identity in a nation that we are going to be proud of in the 21st century? i want our campaign to be a positive answer to what america needs to do in the 21st century not one that appeals to people's fears, but one that appeals to people's hopes when we say we are not going to take pack money and lobbyist money it is not to say all the people in politics are evil or corrupt it is to say there is a better way that the currency of ideas can trump the currency of money in political life and if you do not believe me just look at the founders. they did it and it was much harder for them than it is for us we are saying that there is a better way in american politics that is consistent with our traditions that when you have someone at wilcox knock on your door that is more powerful than 15 mailers that come into your mailbox that when you have people who talk about changing politics because they have a passion for male-icking college debt free but they have a passion for making sure that women and men are treated with equity and are making the same amount of money for the same amount of work or that they care about ideas or public transportation and transportation that comes to santa clara not just san jose that those are ideas that can convince people on their merits that is what this campaign is ultimately about that we want a campaign based on ideas and not based on special interests and to do that you know people say now you know last cycle they would come up to me and say i am with you but you got no shot to win which was fine and now they know it got people coming up to me say oh you are gonna win and i said well let us let us let us go on whether whether we are gonna win or not here is my favorite that and this is people saying you know and nerd or something my favorite quote was for winston churchill and he had said deserved victory and he said that that what he meant by that is it is not just about winning it is about deserving to win. it is about running a campaign that is worthy of victory i want this campaign to be a model for this country. i want this campaign to talk to inspire people to believe that young folks can make a difference that you do not have to be beholden to walk the wall street money or special interests but you can offer a positive economic message. it is gonna provide hope and opportunity for the middle class i want folks to say that here in santa clara you have someone who is a fourth or fifth generation like lisa gilmore standing side by side with immigrants and immigrant from palestine i met today from people whose parents came from india from folks who have come from all over the world to form a common identity for a better politics that is our possibility and to do that i need we need each of us to go out to be passionate to try to make a change i am gonna give my heart to this campaign. rendo is gonna give her heart to to this campaign and my ask if you is get engaged be passionate let us go and show that we can not only win this race, but have a positive vision that is considered an inspire people around the county and around the country thank you for being here. thank you to the great well, there is not really any way possible to try to top that so i am not even gonna start but i do want everyone to hear from another supporter a huge supporter much like yourselves in here and just talk a little bit about their experience in their story. why they are out today peter hootton if you can come up so i first volunteered when i was 15 and first that was like a hundred years and the reason i volunteer is you know there is a phrase about life going on i could not stand to see whatever happens in the country if i did try to make some change uh, and we talk about we are all progressives we are democrats. what does that really mean? it means you want to make some progress you want something to change and i cannot understand how santa clara county can view my conda as a progressive. he is a conservative. he wants to stay with the old world so i saw row running in 2014 and i said this is a leader so i voted for honda when my district now 18 was in his i became redistricted and and i was a loyal voter for my conda but i see the need for leadership. we lost the congress. we lost the house. we lost the senate this chance we could lose the presidency we have to have leaders and we have to get them now so that when we retake the house by 2020 we have people who can lead uh, committees so i see row is not just a loyal democrat, but he is going to be the leader of committees and that is going to make change happen and that is why i was drawn to row come now why i am a volunteer? so we have three categories of people here we have the students we have the middle age and we have the retiree like me although i am not retired. i mean my seventh startup five years each and you all get acquired so good luck to you and i view this campaign as a startup so for students the most important thing you do is learn new skills for your life and understand what you enjoy and what you do not and you get that experience by volunteering you will find out what you like to do uh, if you are in the middle age group a lot of the books have been written about why women do not get the top leadership jobs because they are not sure they can take that next challenge when they are offered an opportunity can you rise to it? it is not just women everybody goes through that and you know when you are a volunteer you have a chance to try things that you would not have otherwise and you gain confidence self-confidence is a big part of how you advance and then if you are in the last category the over 65 you know if you do not exercise your muscles atrophy you get that wrinkled skin but if you exercise you are you are tone and how do you exercise your mind your volunteer you try things that you have never tried before so last weekend i started canvassing in the past i was a phone banker i am a canvasser and so in an hour and a half i got 10 signatures on the petition and the reason is i wanted to learn about the people so obviously i had traction with the uh, 65 and over and i wanted to find out about their life story of their family nobody could refuse to sign the endorsements we need you on every night if you each get 10 that is 100 tonight 35 nights you got the 35 of the signatures you are on the ballot hey, wake, there is a big reward for being a volunteer and it is a personal reward of course you are going to drag along all your family and friends so suddenly we are there this could be so close dragging along all those people is going to make the difference so thank you thank you and thank you everyone for being here it means so much our our staff work so hard to make this a successful event our interns also did amazing work about all of the decorations with good handwriting are from our high school interns and anything you cannot read was probably me or another member of our staff so thank you so much we have not uh, we say it over and over again the students in this district are unbelievable impressive we are so lucky to have 100 campaigns so thank you i almost everything that i was playing to say has already been said i just want to quickly let everybody know that this is a critical moment for our campaign this is a kickoff and more ways than what we are opening the office and we are really ramping up our field program i have a numbers guy and the numbers do not lie and the numbers tell us there is nothing more effective for changing someone's mind and for getting someone to vote than a personal conversation with a real human being more than tv more than mail more than anything else you can do and it matters so much that you who have taken the time to come here to support row take the time to convince your neighbors and your friends to also support row so our staff have been circulating onto your sign-up sheets we would love it if you could donate some of your time there are also circulating petition sheets we need to collect signatures to get row into ballot please do not weave without signing the petition and without making sure you have talked to one of our staff members so i will not keep you any longer i think we still have a ton of great food over there the only problem with this whole event is that we did not have enough tables to hold the amazing food you all brought which is a great problem to have so thank you again and thank you for being members of teamroute we are going to win this thing together thank you so much
