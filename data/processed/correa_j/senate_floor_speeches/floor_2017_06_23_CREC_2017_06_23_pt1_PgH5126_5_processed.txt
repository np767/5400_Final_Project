[congressional record volume 163, number 108 (friday, june 23, 2017)] [house] [pages h5126-h5127] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1115 senate republicans shut the american people out of affordable healthcare (mr. carbajal asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) mr. carbajal. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong opposition to the recently unveiled senate healthcare repeal legislation. the republicans have shut the american public out of their debate and, with this bill, they aim to shut them out of affordable healthcare, too. this bill sets us on a dangerous path backwards, back to a time when cancer patients could be kept out of coverage or kicked off of their insurance because the cost of their care was too high, and to a time where pregnancy could be considered a preexisting condition. congress must work collaboratively to bring down insurance premium costs and work together toward insuring every american, but denying millions of people access to insurance by repealing protections for individuals with preexisting conditions, gutting medicaid, and threatening the solvency of [[page h5127]] the medicare trust fund all in order to give the wealthiest americans a tax cut is wrong. i urge my colleagues in the senate to reject this misguided proposal. ____________________
