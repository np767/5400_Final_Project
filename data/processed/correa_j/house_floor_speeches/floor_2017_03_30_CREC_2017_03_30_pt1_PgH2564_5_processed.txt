[congressional record volume 163, number 56 (thursday, march 30, 2017)] [house] [page h2564] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] russia's interference in our democratic process (mr. carbajal asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. carbajal. madam speaker, i rise today because the american people have the right to know the truth regarding russia's interference in our democratic process. i am a member of the house armed services committee, and the message i hear from our military leaders is consistent: russia is a top threat to the united states and our interests. russia has not only used its military to destabilize regions around the world, but it has completely undermined and disrupted the democratic values of this country. this is unacceptable. and yet my colleagues from the other side of the aisle refuse to do their job as an oversight body and establish a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate russia's egregious behavior. we have a responsibility to be transparent with the american people. i strongly urge my republican colleagues to not only immediately establish an independent investigation into russia's interference in our election, but i also call for the release of president trump's tax returns. america's security and values are on the line. any treasonous and unlawful relations with russia cannot be tolerated. ____________________
