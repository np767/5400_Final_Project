whereas jewish americans have made significant contributions to the arts, entertainment, science and technology, military, government, business, culinary traditions, and other fields in the united states; whereas several prominent jewish americans heroically supported the american revolution and jewish community leaders advocated for freedom of religion for all americans upon the founding of our nation; whereas jewish americans have contributed to the advancement of science to save countless lives and transform our understanding of the universe, including vera rubin, a trailblazer in the field of astronomy whose work established the existence of dark matter, jonas salk, a virologist who developed a vaccine against polio, and albert einstein who was named time magazine's ``person of the century'' for his contributions to the study of mathematics and physics; whereas jewish-american athletes excelled at sports while staying true to their heritage such as sandy koufax, who was the first major league pitcher to pitch 4 no-hitters and chose not to pitch during a world series game when it fell on yom kippur, and hank greenberg, who was the first jewish inductee in the baseball hall of fame in 1954;

and whereas to counter the rise of antisemitism, it is critical to increase awareness of jewish-american contributions, dating back to the founding of the united states: now, therefore, be it resolved, that the house of representatives-- (1) calls on elected officials, faith leaders, and civil society leaders to condemn and counter all acts of antisemitism; (2) calls on the executive branch and state and local leaders to educate the public on the contributions of the jewish-american community and uplift jewish voices; (3) take all possible steps to ensure the safety and security of jewish-american communities;

[[page h3550]] jewish american heritage month, first proclaimed by president george w. bush and each president since, recognizes the contributions of the jewish community to our country. recognizing this month is particularly important following the october 7 terrorist attacks by hamas on israel and the flood of anti- semitism that we have seen in its aftermath. weeks after the october 7 attacks, the judiciary committee held a hearing on the topic of anti-semitism on college campuses. we examined the slow reaction to the sometimes violent pro-hamas rallies and encampments at top institutions across our country. one witness, a student from cornell, testified that she had to think twice about having an outward sign of her jewish faith because she feared for her safety on campus. unfortunately, schools continue to see anti-semitic and anti-american encampments and protests lasting months. according to the american jewish committee, nearly half of american jews have altered their behavior due to concerns about anti-semitism. almost two-thirds of american jews feel less secure in the united states than they did a year ago. hillel international has reported 1,597 anti-semitic incidents on college campuses since october 7, which is a 700 percent increase over the same period last year. last month, the judiciary committee held a second hearing about anti- semitism on college campuses with students and experts. one student testified that bigotry, violence, and harassment had become part of daily life as a jewish student at penn. another testified that a university employee threatened him with a machete after the student denounced the defacing of campus posters that displayed the names and faces of israeli hostages held by hamas. mr. speaker, this is unacceptable and simply cannot continue. this house, elected officials at the state and local level, faith leaders, community leaders, and university administrators all have an obligation to confront this anti-semitism. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this resolution. i thank the ranking member of the committee for his work, and i thank the sponsor of the legislation, the gentlewoman from the great state of florida (ms. wasserman schultz), and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. nadler. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this resolution recognizing jewish american heritage month and the important contributions that jewish americans have made to our history, our society, and our culture. i thank congresswoman wasserman schultz for introducing this resolution and for her passionate work to ensure that we in congress and americans around the country observe this annual celebration of the integral role jewish americans have played in shaping our nation. congress first marked jewish american heritage month in 2005, but, of course, jewish contributions to american society began centuries ago, even before the founding of the united states. in fact, the first group of jews arrived in the united colonies in 1654, when they fled the portuguese inquisition and found refuge in new amsterdam, what we now call new york city, and they have flourished ever since. this small jewish community of 23 people fleeing persecution has grown into more than 7 million people, and jewish americans have become part of the essential fabric of the united states. from the very founding of the country, jews have been an integral part of the american story. famously, in 1790, president george washington wrote a letter to the touro synagogue in newport, rhode island, in which he wrote: ``may the children of the stock of abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants; while everyone shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.'' courageous jews have also been key figures in american history. in 1855, rabbi david einhorn became the first rabbi of har sinai congregation in baltimore, the oldest reform american jewish synagogue. unpopular in baltimore at the time, rabbi einhorn passionately and vehemently wrote and spoke against slavery, decrying it as a moral evil. in 1861, after delivering a sermon denouncing slavery, a pro- slavery mob swelled and drove rabbi einhorn out of town. rabbi abraham joshua heschel, whose relationship with reverend martin luther king has become one of the most famous interfaith partnerships in america, also spoke out courageously for civil rights. a professor at the jewish theological seminary of america located in the morningside heights neighborhood of manhattan, rabbi heschel had a vital and lasting contribution to religious discourse on civil rights. on march 21, 1965, rabbi heschel marched arm in arm with dr. king in selma, alabama, a pivotal moment in the history of this country. as rabbi heschel's daughter, professor susannah heschel, wrote: ``the photograph of abraham joshua heschel walking arm in arm with martin luther king, jr., in the front row of marchers at selma has become an icon of american jewish life, and of black-jewish relations. reprinted in jewish textbooks, synagogue bulletins, and in studies of ecumenical relations, the picture has come to symbolize the great moment of symbiosis of the two communities, black and jewish. . . .'' i am proud to represent a district of one of the largest jewish communities in the united states. new york 12 is home to many historic jewish institutions that represent the rich diversity of this community. this includes two historic synagogues in the upper west side of manhattan: congregation shearith israel, which was founded by those 23 jews in 1654, as well as the first reconstructionist synagogue, the society for the advancement of judaism, at which the first bat mitzvah in the united states took place. as the most senior jewish member of congress, i am also keenly aware that as we celebrate the history and the contributions of jewish americans this year, jewish american heritage month came on the backdrop of increased anti-semitism in this country. anti-semitism is not a new phenomenon and has plagued jewish communities around the world for millennia. yet, we have recently experienced a dramatic uptick in anti-semitism. the anti-defamation league's 2023 audit of anti-semitic incidents found a 140 percent increase from the 2022 audit and the highest number on record since the anti-defamation league began tracking it in 1979. the adl also recorded a 135 percent increase of anti-semitic incidents at k-12 schools and a 321 percent increase on college and university campuses compared to the same time the previous year, with most occurring after october 7. this harrowing uptick in anti-semitic attacks is devastating and urgent. it demonstrates a necessity for us to redouble our efforts to combat this horrific hatred. last year, i warmly welcomed the first-ever national strategy to counter anti-semitism, which was developed by the biden administration. {time} 1415 this historic effort includes concrete steps that we can all take, including civil society, local government, congress, and the executive branch to tangibly enact the priorities articulated in the strategy. this year, i believe we must all work to fully actualize and implement the national strategy, including passing the countering antisemitism act championed by my friend congresswoman manning. jewish american heritage month reminds us that as we continue to fight against anti-semitism, we also celebrate the countless contributions made by jewish americans. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. wasserman schultz), the chief sponsor of this resolution. ms. wasserman schultz. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding and deeply appreciate the gentleman from new york's leadership as the senior jewish member of the entire house of representatives and his decades of support and leadership on issues important to the jewish american community. [[page h3551]] i also thank the gentleman from ohio, the chairman of the judiciary committee, who i am glad to work with on this issue and for his assistance in bringing this important resolution to the floor. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of my resolution, h. res. 1215 to recognize jewish american heritage month and highlight the longstanding contributions of the jewish-american community to our country. mr. speaker, i thank representatives troy carter, miller-meeks, and fitzpatrick for joining me to co-lead this resolution, as well. jahm is an annual may celebration, a time to come together and celebrate generations of jewish americans who have been an integral part of the rich mosaic of people and heritages that make up the united states. while jahm is a joyful month, we celebrated it this year under the shadow of hamas' october 7 attack on israel, the deadliest day for jews since the holocaust. since then, the united states has witnessed a historic rise in anti- semitism. in 2023, the adl tracked 8,873 anti-semitic incidents across america, a 140 percent increase from the previous year and the highest number on record since it began tracking these instances of hate since 1979. according to the american jewish committee, nearly two-thirds of american jews, as the chairman mentioned, feel less secure in the u.s. than they did a year ago. make no mistake, anti-semitism is a canary in the coal mine. according to adl's report on anti-semitism and support for political violence, highly anti-semitic americans are twice as likely to support dangerous antidemocratic conspiracies such as the great replacement theory. this was on clear display as white supremacists marched through charlottesville chanting ``jews will not replace us.'' such hate must be answered. we must do more to show our support and uplift the jewish american community. in president biden's national strategy to counter anti-semitism, the u.s.'s first-ever blueprint, calls on all aspects of society to commemorate jahm and use it as a tool to fight hate. we need jews and non-jews alike to learn about all of the remarkable jewish americans who served in government, the military, or who won nobel prizes, led universities, and made lifesaving medical discoveries that we all count on today. the fact that so many significant contributions to america's success were led by jewish americans is not widely known. today's resolution highlights just a fraction of the jewish americans who made our nation and the world better. jonas salk was a virologist who developed the polio vaccine. florence prag kahn, a republican, was the first jewish woman member of congress and first woman to serve on the house military affairs committee. i ask my colleagues to just walk down the stairs and you will see her portrait hanging on the way down the steps to commemorate the significance of her service. jack greenberg argued against segregation in brown v. board of education as co-counsel to thurgood marshall and succeeded marshall as director-counsel of the naacp legal defense fund. the jewish community's commitment to tikkun olam, a commitment to repair the world, is clear across so many generations of americans. as we celebrated the end of the 19th year of jewish american heritage month just a few days ago, it is clear that each year jahm becomes bigger and better than the year before, and the need to make sure that we can shine a spotlight on the contributions that american jews have made to the success of america is even more critical given the precipitous rise in anti-semitism. this annual blaze of education and understanding will surely eclipse enmity and intolerance. madam speaker, i thank all for helping me shine that light, and i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution. i look forward to continuing to celebrate jewish american heritage month for many years to come. mr. jordan. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. nadler. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. madam speaker, during jewish american heritage month, we celebrated the rich history and many contributions of jewish americans. we also recognize that anti-semitism continues to be a scourge in our society that we must continue to combat in all its forms. i thank the gentlewoman from florida (ms. wasserman schultz) for bringing forward this important resolution. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to support it, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. jordan. madam speaker, the jewish american people have done so much for our culture and our country as have the jewish people all over our planet. i will also say that the jewish nation has just done amazing things and they are our dearest and closest friend, the jewish state of israel. my wife and i have had the opportunity to travel there five times, and we have enjoyed every single visit. it is just a fascinating, amazing place, amazing country, with amazing people. we, as americans, should do everything we can to help israel win, as well as celebrate all the amazing contributions. we want to make sure they win this battle against a terrorist organization, not put limits on them, not tell them what they can and cannot do, but help them win. i think this resolution is in support of that overall effort, and we strongly support it. madam speaker, i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it, and i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore (mrs. lesko). the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from ohio (mr. jordan) that the house suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, h. res. 1215, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. ms. wasserman schultz. madam speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________
