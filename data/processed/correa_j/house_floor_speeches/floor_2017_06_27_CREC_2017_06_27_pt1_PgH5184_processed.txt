[congressional record volume 163, number 110 (tuesday, june 27, 2017)] [house] [page h5184] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] american grown flower month the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california (mr. carbajal) for 5 minutes. mr. carbajal. mr. speaker, today i proudly introduce bipartisan legislation to recognize july as american grown flower month. i have seen firsthand the value of the grown flower industry playing an important role in our economy and community during my visits with our central coast growers in my district. california produces three-quarters of all cut flowers grown here in the united states. this generates thousands of jobs across our state and drives a staggering $1.13 billion in the economic activity each year. whether it is celebrating mother's day, a birthday, or a graduation, flowers have been used to mark special occasions dating back thousands of years. i am committed to recognizing this industry's remarkable contribution to our country by designating july as american grown flower month. we officially celebrate the incomparable beauty flowers bring to our homes and to our celebrations year round. i also want to urge the white house to consider having american flowers in the white house for all occasions. ____________________
