[congressional record volume 163, number 112 (thursday, june 29, 2017)] [house] [page h5300] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] cuts to medicaid the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california (mr. carbajal) for 5 minutes. mr. carbajal. mr. speaker, i rise today on behalf of children and adults living with disabilities across the united states. the cuts to medicaid outlined in the dangerous senate healthcare repeal bill will not only result in the loss of healthcare access for millions of americans, but will also significantly reduce funding for in-home supportive services in my home state of california. medicaid covers 50 percent of the program costs for in-home supportive services. these funds provide care for an estimated 531,000 disabled children and seniors throughout california, which permits them to continue to live with dignity in their own home. the $772 billion cut to medicaid outlined in this bill will have a devastating impact on seniors and people with disabilities who rely on medicaid as their safety net for necessary long-term care services. these cuts will directly affect the lives of my constituents, including 15-year-old crystal from santa maria, california, in my district. crystal was born with spina bifida, weighing in at just 2 pounds. she has survived under the dedicated care of her mother and grandmother, who are her primary caretakers. crystal is covered by medicaid, which allows her to receive specialized medical attention, adaptive medical equipment, physical therapy, and pharmaceuticals. crystal's condition requires 24-hour care, a need that is fulfilled by the in-home supportive services program. her life is contingent upon this program. i call upon my colleagues in the senate to vote against this cruel healthcare repeal, also known as trumpcare, for crystal and the millions of our constituents like her who are at risk of losing their quality of life. ____________________
