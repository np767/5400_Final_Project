(2) the basin contains over 12,500 square miles of land in the states of delaware, new jersey, new york, and pennsylvania, including nearly 800 square miles of bay and more than 2,000 tributary rivers and streams; (3) the basin is home to more than 8,000,000 people who depend on the delaware river and the delaware bay as an economic engine, a place of recreation, and a vital habitat for fish and wildlife; (4) the basin provides clean drinking water to more than 15,000,000 people, including new york city, which relies on the basin for approximately half of the drinking water supply of the city, and philadelphia, whose most significant threat to the drinking water supply of the city is loss of forests and other natural cover in the upper basin, according to a study conducted by the philadelphia water department; (5) the basin contributes $25,000,000,000 annually in economic activity, provides $21,000,000,000 in ecosystem goods and services per year, and is directly or indirectly responsible for 600,000 jobs with $10,000,000,000 in annual wages; (6) almost 180 species of fish and wildlife are considered special status species in the basin due to habitat loss and degradation, particularly sturgeon, eastern oyster, horseshoe crabs, and red knots, which have been identified as unique species in need of habitat improvement; (7) the basin provides habitat for over 200 resident and migrant fish species, includes significant recreational fisheries, and is an important source of eastern oyster, blue crab, and the largest population of the american horseshoe crab; (8) the annual dockside value of commercial eastern oyster fishery landings for the delaware estuary is nearly $4,000,000, making it the fourth most lucrative fishery in the delaware river basin watershed, and proven management strategies are available to increase oyster habitat, abundance, and harvest; (9) the delaware bay has the second largest concentration of shorebirds in north america and is designated as one of the 4 most important shorebird migration sites in the world; (10) the basin, 50 percent of which is forested, also has over 700,000 acres of wetland, more than 126,000 acres of which are recognized as internationally important, resulting in a landscape that provides essential ecosystem services, including recreation, commercial, and water quality benefits; (11) much of the remaining exemplary natural landscape in the basin is vulnerable to further degradation, as the basin gains approximately 10 square miles of developed land annually, and with new development, urban watersheds are increasingly covered by impervious surfaces, amplifying the quantity of polluted runoff into rivers and streams; (12) the delaware river is the longest undammed river east of the mississippi; a critical component of the national wild and scenic rivers system in the northeast, with more than 400 miles designated; home to one of the most heavily visited national park units in the united states, the delaware water gap national recreation area; and the location of 6 national wildlife refuges; (13) the delaware river supports an internationally renowned cold water fishery in more than 80 miles of its northern headwaters that attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year and generates over $21,000,000 in annual revenue through tourism and recreational activities; (14) management of water volume in the basin is critical to flood mitigation and habitat for fish and wildlife, and following 3 major floods along the delaware river since 2004, the governors of the states of delaware, new jersey, new york, and pennsylvania have called for natural flood damage reduction measures to combat the problem, including restoring the function of riparian corridors; (15) the delaware river port complex (including docking facilities in the states of delaware, new jersey, and pennsylvania) is one of the largest freshwater ports in the world, the port of philadelphia handles the largest volume of international tonnage and 70 percent of the oil shipped to the east coast, and the port of wilmington, a full-service deepwater port and marine terminal supporting more than 12,000 jobs, is the busiest terminal on the delaware river, handling more than 400 vessels per year with an annual import/export cargo tonnage of more than 4,000,000 tons; (16) the delaware estuary, where freshwater from the delaware river mixes with saltwater from the atlantic ocean, is one of the largest and most complex of the 28 estuaries in the national estuary program, and the partnership for the delaware estuary works to improve the environmental health of the delaware estuary; (17) the delaware river basin commission is a federal- interstate compact government agency charged with overseeing a unified approach to managing the river system and implementing important water resources management projects and activities throughout the basin that are in the national interest; (18) restoration activities in the basin are supported through several federal and state agency programs, and funding for those important programs should continue and complement the establishment of the delaware river basin restoration program, which is intended to build on and help coordinate restoration and protection funding mechanisms at the federal, state, regional, and local levels; and (19) the existing and ongoing voluntary conservation efforts in the delaware river basin necessitate improved efficiency and cost effectiveness, as well as increased private-sector investments and coordination of federal and non-federal resources. sec. 3502. definitions. in this subtitle: (1) basin.--the term ``basin'' means the 4-state delaware basin region, including all of [[page h7451]] delaware bay and portions of the states of delaware, new jersey, new york, and pennsylvania located in the delaware river watershed.

leave mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on s. 612. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from pennsylvania? there was no objection. mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of s. 612, the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act, or the wiin act. this is a comprehensive bill to address water resources and infrastructure issues across the country and could be one of the final achievements of this congress. today we have an opportunity to deliver one more win for america. the wiin act includes the water resources development act as title i. ranking member defazio and i worked very closely throughout the process to ensure his and other democratic priorities were preserved in this final bill. so i want to thank ranking member defazio for his work with me on the wrda title. however, this bill is bigger than just wrda, and i also want to thank the energy and commerce committee chairman upton, the natural resources committee chairman bishop, and our senate counterparts for helping us put together this package today. this legislation provides important direction from congress to the army corps of engineers in their missions to improve our infrastructure. the bill strengthens america's competitiveness, creates jobs, and grows the economy. the wiin act maintains congressional constitutional authority to ensure our infrastructure is safe and effective. this bill contains authorizations for 30 corps chief's reports, eight post-authorization change reports, and 37 feasibility studies for projects across the united states. today's legislation restores regular order and the 2-year cycle of congress considering these essential wrda bills. simply put, mr. speaker, this is good public policy, so i strongly urge my colleagues to support this jobs and infrastructure bill. water infrastructure improvements for the nation (wiin) act--letters of support over 70 organizations support waterways council, inc.; american

balance of my time. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. unfortunately, today i rise in opposition to s. 612. at one point, i wholeheartedly supported this bill. there should be nothing partisan about infrastructure. building and rebuilding infrastructure for transportation of goods and people, for shipping, for rail, for other aspects, and clean water--all that should be nonpartisan. it is in the best interests of the united states of america to make us more competitive and more efficient. this bill reflected the best of that tradition when it came out of the committee. unfortunately, a number of things have happened since. first, when we came to the floor, the leadership stripped out a provision which was adopted unanimously in committee to make the harbor maintenance trust fund into a trust fund--spending the tax that is collected for harbor maintenance on--shocking in washington, d.c.--harbor maintenance. right now, the budget committee diverts that money every year somewhere else--imaginary deficit reduction or some other program--and we underspend, through the appropriations process, that money. so the americans are paying a tax. every good you buy that is imported you pay a little bit more for it. you are paying that tax, and congress is diverting the money while our harbors shoal in and our jetties crumble, and we cannot compete in the world market. the committee had adopted a provision to turn that into a real trust fund and spend the money on harbor maintenance. that was stripped out because of objections by the budget committee that wants to divert the money and the appropriations committee that wants to divert the money. that just should not be. i want to thank the chairman for promising to continue to work on that issue, which came out of committee, when we do the water resources development bill again next year. hopefully, the trump administration will take a different position on this. there is $9 billion sitting there waiting to be spent tomorrow of taxes that have already been collected to maintain our harbors that congress does not want to spend, despite the shoaling in and the jetties' deteriorating conditions. so, hopefully, the new administration will take a different position in the budget on that. secondly, just this week, a 100-page provision which did not come from our committee, which relates to a hugely controversial water diversion and settlement of disputes in california pitting members of the california delegation on both sides of the aisle against one another, does not only just affect california, because sacramento salmon swim north, and the last time we had a bad drought they shut down all the fishing on the southern oregon coast because of endangered sacramento salmon. our salmon were doing fine. so if they start diverting more water from the delta, from the sacramento, it is likely that our fisheries will be shut down in oregon because of this misplaced provision which has not had any congressional review of any sort in any committee in this house. {time} 1100 finally, gratuitously, as part of that gigantic project in california, they are undermining buy america and davis-bacon provisions. i hope this is not a harbinger of things to come, that despite the president who wants a stronger buy america, that the republican house is going to want to undermine buy america and start buying chinese and russian steel for our projects and doing away with prevailing wages paying a good living wage to people who work in construction jobs. it is very unfortunate that was inserted in this bill. but there are many meritorious provisions in the bill set aside for dredging of small harbors and many, many individual projects and authorizations in the bill. had these other three things not happened, i would have enthusiastically supported it, but, unfortunately, i will have to oppose the bill. i reserve the balance of my time. i rise in reluctant opposition to s. 612. mr. speaker, at one time, this bill had great promise. at one time, this bill represented the bipartisan traditions of the committee on transportation and infrastructure. when the committee unanimously reported this bill to the house, i was proud to support the water resources development act of 2016. however, since that time, the house republican leadership has unilaterally stripped key democratic priorities and air-dropped-in controversial republican provisions making it impossible for me to support the bill today. at every step of the legislative process, house republican leaders have morphed what was once the product of months of hard work by the committee on transportation and infrastructure into something that i, as the ranking democrat on the committee, can no longer support--despite the fact that some good policy provisions remain in this bill. that being said, i thank the chairman of the committee, mr. shuster, for following through on his promise to pass a water resources development act this congress. in may, the committee on transportation and infrastructure unanimously approved wrda. that bipartisan bill took a bold step to ensure that congress would begin to draw down the enormous surplus in the harbor maintenance trust fund (hmtf). this position, one that the committee on transportation and infrastructure has fought for, on a bipartisan basis, for decades, would have made the $9 billion surplus of the hmtf immediately available to the secretary of the army to dredge our nation's harbors. unfortunately, this provision was stripped from the bill by the house republican leadership before floor consideration, and was not included in the house-passed wrda. this important provision would have unlocked the hmtf to ensure that revenues collected from shippers are used to dredge our nation's harbors, and are not diverted to cover other debts of the u.s. treasury. despite this, i want to thank chairman shuster for his commitment to work with me in the next congress to unlock the hmtf once and for all. without this provision, the balance in the trust fund will double in the next decade to more than $17 billion and continue to grow year after year, despite the tremendous needs of our nation's ports and harbors. i am confident that, in the 115th congress, the committee on transportation and infrastructure can achieve full use of the hmtf, and strengthen and maintain our ports, harbors and waterways, and our nation's economic competitiveness. i thank chairman shuster for his promise to work with me to achieve full use of the hmtf in the next congress. again, while i will oppose final passage of this bill, i do want to highlight several promising provisions in the bill. emblematic of prior water resources legislation, s. 612 authorizes all pending corps of engineers' project authorizations--valued at more than $10 billion. it also authorizes 32 new feasibility studies and additional project modifications to existing corps' projects--the first such provisions enacted since 2007. the bill also includes several provisions to improve the overall efficiency and transparency of the corps in carrying out its construction and regulatory missions while preserving existing federal environmental protections. for example, s. 612 includes a provision that requires the corps to coordinate the regulatory review of project modifications (so-called section 408 reviews) with the expectation that these coordinated reviews will help expedite the decision-making process. s. 612 also directs the secretary to expeditiously complete a report to congress on any materials, articles, or supplies manufactured outside the united states that are currently used in corps projects. this report will be critical to increased oversight by this committee of the use of foreign-manufactured goods in corps projects. [[page h7486]] s. 612 also includes provisions to preserve and enhance the participation of indian tribes in our water-related infrastructure, as well as honor commitments made by the u.s. government to the tribes. first, the bill includes a provision that authorizes the corps to provide immediate housing assistance to the indian tribes displaced as a result of the construction of the bonneville dam, as well as to further study those indian tribes displaced from the construction of the john day dam. both of these provisions are intended to ensure that the federal government lives up to the commitments made to the tribes for construction of these two projects generations ago. in addition, s. 612 includes a provision that directs the corps to undertake a comprehensive study of the existing tribal consultation process for the construction of any water resources development project, or any other project that may require the corps' approval or the issuance of a corps permit. as recent events have shown, it is past time for the corps to revisit its existing tribal consultation processes to ensure that the corps undertakes meaningful consultation with indian tribes for projects that may have an impact on tribal cultural or natural resources. i look forward to working with the corps to ensure that this study and report are completed within the year. i am also pleased that s. 612 provides the framework for the federal government to finally meet its commitment to help the families affected by lead-contaminated water in flint, michigan. while the funding for these projects will ultimately be included in the appropriations bill that funds the government into next year, i support the inclusion of additional drinking water state revolving fund resources for communities experiencing public health threats associated with lead- water contamination, and urge the administration to release these funds to the state of michigan and to the city of flint as quickly as possible. the bill also benefits my home state of oregon. first, and foremost, the bill makes permanent the existing set-aside of harbor maintenance funding for small commercial harbors. these small commercial harbors are the lifeblood of local and regional economies; yet, for decades, federal dredging needs at these harbors went unmet. s. 612 makes permanent the existing 10 percent set-aside of annual federal maintenance dredging funds for these types of harbors, and ensures that this 10 percent is the minimum (not the maximum) amount allocated to small commercial harbors from both baseline funding and priority funds. the bill also provides for the first-ever survey of the condition of existing breakwaters and jetties protecting federal harbors. in the northwest, these critical structures are crumbling, failing to provide necessary protection for shippers and fishermen alike, and increasing the long-term costs of maintaining our ports and harbors. this survey will provide congress with critical information on the condition of breakwaters and levees so that we may start the process of repairing or replacing these structures in the near future. i am pleased that s. 612 also authorizes a new columbia river basin restoration program at the environmental protection agency to help reduce toxic contamination and clean up contaminated sites in the columbia river basin. however, mr. speaker, there are also provisions in this bill that i cannot support. for example, when the water resources development act of 2016 was considered in the house in september, i sponsored an amendment to ensure that scarce federal funds are not used for the construction of non-economically-justified projects, or projects for the construction of ballfields and splash parks. unfortunately, at the insistence of the republican majority, the authorization of the central city; texas project remains in this final bill, without the protections for taxpayers that i sought in my amendment. should this project continue, i will continue to press the committee and the corps to oversee this project to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not wasted on frivolous and non-economically-justified projects, regardless of where they are constructed. in addition, i did not support the inclusion in this bill of those provisions which side with one state over another in regional water issues, such as those involving the apalachicola-chattahoochee-flint watersheds in the states of georgia, florida, and alabama. i do not support the inclusion of any of the provisions that purport to grant a private citizen with some undefined property right to publically-owned or managed property. these provisions, such as section 1148 (cumberland river, kentucky), section 1185 (table rock lake, arkansas and missouri), and section 5003 (tennessee valley authority jurisdictional waters), follow a concerning trend that seeks to provide some enforceable interest in public lands and resources for which no right currently exists, or no agreement with or payment to the government is made. congress should conduct proper oversight of these and any future proposals to grant such a property right to ensure that public resources are properly held in trust for the good of the nation, and not the benefit of private individuals or interests. in addition, i oppose efforts by the republican leadership to undermine worker protections and buy america requirements for programs and projects authorized by this bill. if enacted, these provisions will undermine the principle of prevailing wage protections for construction jobs, and open the door to using american taxpayer dollars to pass off goods made with russian and chinese steel as ``made-in-america'' . finally, and most egregiously, i am opposed to the inclusion of the last-minute, nearly 100-page california water poison pill that was developed behind closed doors and with no apparent public debate. it deeply divides the existing california congressional delegation, regardless of party, and picks winners and losers in a region-against- region and industry-against-industry fight for water in california. this provision was dropped on our lap on monday. it jeopardizes not only our bill, but also oregon's fishing industry and thousands of jobs that depend on sustainable fisheries. i cannot support a bill that will jeopardize thousands of jobs and our economic engine on the oregon coast. again, i want to thank chairman shuster for his work on this bill. i am disappointed that the good work of our committee has been sullied by the whims of house republican leaders, and hope that, in the next congress, we can restore the strong and lasting commitments made between the majority and minority members of the committee on transportation and infrastructure. for these reasons, i oppose s. 612. mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from ohio (mr. gibbs), the chairman of the subcommittee on water resources and environment. mr. gibbs. mr. speaker, today i rise in support of s. 612, the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act, the wiin act. the wiin act is a vital water infrastructure bill that contains the water resources development act of 2016. as chairman of the subcommittee on water resources and environment, our jurisdiction includes water resources development missions of the u.s. corps of engineers. this bill is a compromise between the senate and the house and authorizes the construction of key water infrastructure projects throughout the nation. these projects create jobs here at home and have a direct impact on our economy and our national security. the critically important corps project authorizations are for the purposes of navigation and flood control, recreation, water supply, environmental protection, and so on. each of the projects--30 projects that were mentioned by the chairman--was recommended by non-federal sponsors to the corps. each of these are economically justified, environmentally acceptable, and technically achievable. they are the gold standard. my subcommittee held multiple hearings to discuss the chief's reports and post-authorization change reports in depth, and my subcommittee provided strong congressional oversight of these proposed activities. many state, local, and regional areas will gain from the economic benefits of this bill. one example is the upper ohio chief's report will greatly benefit my home state of ohio by improving navigation within the existing locks and dams. more importantly, this project provides even greater benefits to the nation, ensuring commodities reach foreign and domestic markets in a cost-effective manner. this bill is fiscally responsible. the new project authorizations are fully offset by deauthorizations of projects that are outdated or no longer viable. this bill contains an important pilot program for the beneficial reuse of dredged materials. this innovative program looks for ways to maximize dredged material based upon environmental, economic, and social benefits. the wiin act contains no earmarks, it strengthens our water transportation networks, and it increases transparency for non-federal sponsors and the public. i strongly urge members to support this bill. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california (mrs. napolitano), the ranking member of the subcommittee. mrs. napolitano. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the water resources development act, s. 612. [[page h7487]] i strongly support the bipartisan work done by the transportation and infrastructure committee on the army corps provisions that create policy and authorize projects around the country for flood damage reduction, ecosystem restoration, water supply, recreation, and navigation. there is something for everyone in this bill. i am particularly appreciative that this bill authorizes the los angeles river project, which will rejuvenate the river by improving wildlife habitat and creating recreational opportunities for southern california residents. i thank chairman shuster, ranking member defazio, and chairman gibbs for working with me and my staff to include multiple provisions that will improve water supply and local collaboration at the army corps facilities. these provisions include: providing more water supply to local communities by improving on wrda '14 provisions and requiring the corps to capture more water for groundwater replenishment, especially in long angeles county; promoting local and private sector combined efforts to remove sediment from corps dams and improve water supply, which will benefit all dams, including santa fe dam in my district; requiring the corps to work more collaboratively with local communities on sharing water data and improving watershed management, in other words, transparency; and extending current law on donor port provisions important to the ports of los angeles, long beach, and many other ports. i also support the provisions in the bill that include providing assistance for the drinking water crisis in flint, michigan, and other areas of the country, which include california, although we should be investing more in our outdated drinking water infrastructure. i disagree with the leadership's decision to add a california water provision to wrda at the last minute. this provision should have been addressed as its own legislation and not attached to the traditionally bipartisan wrda bill that so many members, including senator boxer, have worked so hard on. if i had been consulted on this provision, i would have strongly advocated for more than $50 million for title xvi and $100 million for watersmart, as these programs are the most cost effective at addressing our drought crisis. i want to thank the many water agencies and associations, such as the national association of flood and stormwater management agencies, the county of los angeles department of public works, the upper san gabriel valley water district, and the three valleys municipal water district that have worked with my office on this bill throughout the process, and overwhelmingly support wrda. i greatly respect and recognize that there are members who disagree on the final passage based on the needs of their own districts and constituents, and i would like to work with them. the metropolitan water district of southern california, december 6, 2016. re: support water resources development act (wrda) bi- partisan drought provision hon. dianne feinstein, u.s. senate, washington, dc. dear senator feinstein: as the nation's largest provider of drinking water, the metropolitan water district of southern california would like to thank you for your leadership in responding to california's unprecedented drought. we support the drought provisions that you negotiated with the house, included in h.r. 2533 the water resources development act (wrda) of 2016, to help us better manage our limited water resources. we also support the broader wrda package which will provide strategic authorizations and investments to develop, manage and improve essential water infrastructure and operations in the united states. while rains have returned to northern california, we have little assurance of the water year ahead. southern california is heading into its sixth year of drought. were it not for the imported water that metropolitan brings to the southland, the groundwater basins and surface reservoirs would be at historic lows. this imported water remains an essential component of southern california's water supply portfolio, and we cannot afford to miss out on capturing supplies during the few large storm events that come each year. your drought provisions will help to maximize pumping while maintaining the protections provided to california's native species through the endangered species act and the biological opinions that currently protect salmon and smelt. these protections are important to metropolitan to ensure we continue to operate in an environmentally responsible manner. equally important is the need for investment in new local water supplies to help california adjust to climate conditions that are reducing our snowpack and changing rain patterns. investments in recycling, desalination, groundwater treatment and conservation that are included in the drought provisions of the legislation are vital to this region. reforming title xvi to allow recycled water projects to compete for funding is an important first step. wrda includes many other important provisions that will benefit california water users including funding for improvements to u.s. rivers and harbors, improved science, conservation initiatives, infrastructure development, ecosystem restoration and sustainability. these programs will improve the nation's drinking water resources and improve our water resiliency as a nation. metropolitan appreciates your leadership on national water policy initiatives and your ongoing support and commitment to finding solutions for california's water supply and water quality concerns. we look forward to continuing to work with you to advance these objectives. sincerely, jeffrey kightlinger, general manager. ____ three valleys mwd, december 6, 2016. re: s. 2533--california emergency drought relief act--support hon. dianne feinstein, u.s. senate, washington, dc. dear senator feinstein: i am writing to you on behalf of the three valleys municipal water district (tvmwd) to express our support for s. 2533--the california emergency drought relief act. tvmwd is a wholesale water supplier and member agency of the metropolitan water district of southern california, responsible for providing treated import water supplies to over half a million people covering the pomona, walnut and east san gabriel valleys. despite improving hydrologic conditions in 2016, many regions in california continued to suffer water supply shortages resulting from several years of prolonged drought and regulations that affect the operations of the state's major water supply projects. s. 2533 is designed to provide reasonable solutions to address both the short-term and long- term water supply needs for the state. it does this by investing in water storage, conservation, recycling and desalination, along with innovative water infrastructure financing. these provisions align with proposition 1, which was passed by california voters in 2014, thus enhancing state law with the coordinated activities of the federal agencies. the bill upholds and protects state water rights and water law and there is an environmental protection mandate repeated throughout the text of the bill. moreover, s. 2533 makes provision for additional protections of at-risk fish species and provides tools to improve the delta environment. the drought has shown how we must take a holistic look at how we manage the entire ecosystem for the benefit of both native species and water supply reliability. s. 2533 will provide critical resources to assist california in the current drought and invest in long-term water infrastructure to help the state in the future and we are pleased to offer our support. we are requesting that our local representatives support your efforts to pass this important legislation and ask that they make you aware of that support. if you have any questions regarding tvmwd and its position, please do not hesitate to contact me at 909- 621-5568. sincerely, richard hansen, p.e., general manager. ____ upper san gabriel valley municipal water district, hon. grace f. napolitano, house of representatives, washington dc. dear representative napolitano: upper san gabriel valley municipal water district (upper district) supports s. 612, the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act (wiin), a compromise bill that includes the water resources development act (wrda) of 2016. we believe this important legislation is vital to california's water future and is consistent with our state's policy of managing water resources for the coequal goals of enhancing ecosystem health and improving water supply reliability. s. 612 contains key provisions from the wrda which will authorize numerous projects in california, including restoration of the los angeles river, lake tahoe and the salton sea. upper district is pleased to see the bill authorizes $558 million for critical projects, that will help supplement state and local funding to construct new source water projects that will help manage our groundwater basin which has reached historic lows during california's five-year drought. in addition, it will help local water agencies work with the u.s. army corps of engineers on stormwater capture projects and groundwater recharge projects, and provides direction to the corps to engage in environmental infrastructure projects, including water recycling projects. we are also pleased to see reforms made to title xvi to allow recycled water projects to compete for funding. [[page h7488]] this legislation reflects compromises that will improve water supplies for all californians and reflects a balanced compromise that will help provide improved water supplies without violating the endangered species act or existing biological opinions that govern pumping operations in the sensitive bay-delta eco-system. upper district appreciates your leadership on national water policy initiatives and your ongoing support and commitment to finding solutions for california's water supply. we strongly support passage of this legislation and respectfully ask for your vote in favor. sincerely, shane chapman, general manager. mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. calvert), the chairman on the appropriations interior, environment, and related agencies subcommittee. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of the wiin act. the bill contains a number of provisions that help improve the water infrastructure across the country. my home state of california continues to suffer from drought conditions and a water system that has failed to keep up with tremendous population growth. thankfully, this bill contains a number of solutions that will help address california's water challenges. in my experience, there are few things more difficult than water negotiations, and these negotiations over california water provisions proved to be no different. i am also pleased that this bill includes legislation i introduced to finalize the pechanga band of luiseno water rights settlement. mr. speaker, i want to thank senator feinstein for making today possible, chairman shuster and his committee for their hard work, kiel weaver for his efforts to get california water across the line, and ian foley for his tireless work. i encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from connecticut (ms. delauro). ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i rise to engage the chairman and ranking member in a brief colloquy on behalf of the connecticut congressional delegation and long island sound. the sound is a treasured and integral source, one that generates $9 billion annually through tourism, recreation, and economic activity, so the importance of dredging activities to our state and the larger region cannot be overstated. therefore, we seek clarification with the constant intent of section 1189 and the dredging provisions contained in the wiin act. i yield to the gentleman from connecticut (mr. courtney). mr. courtney. mr. speaker, if we understand section 1189 correctly, nothing in s. 612 gives any states any new rights by which to impose its own water quality standards on any other state. rather, section 1189 is simply a restatement of current law under the clean water act. additionally, we understand that no provision in this bill revises the army corps' federal standard of dredged material from federal projects; and as is affirmed through a sense of congress in section 1188 of this bill, the best way to resolve any disagreements over state water quality standards is collaboratively with input from all stakeholders. is that a correct reading of the bill? mr. shuster. will the gentlewoman yield? ms. delauro. i yield to the gentleman from pennsylvania. mr. shuster. yes. mr. defazio. will the gentlewoman yield? ms. delauro. i yield to the gentleman from oregon. mr. defazio. i would say yes. mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. mccarthy). mr. mccarthy. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding, and i want to thank the chairman for his hard work on this bill and his bipartisan effort in putting it together. mr. speaker, americans understand intuitively that governments are set up for the benefit of the people. those who are civic-minded, who pay their taxes, live according to the law, and treat their fellow citizens with respect deserve certain guarantees: their government will keep them safe from enemies at home and abroad; their government will defend their most basic constitutional rights; and their government will ensure that people have access to basic necessities fundamental to life. i ask this body, mr. speaker, what could be more fundamental to life than water? america is not some third world country--we are a wealthy nation--and we will not let any american go without water. i am proud we are voting on legislation today to deliver water to the people across the country by updating our water resource projects and changing outdated water policies. but, mr. speaker, we cannot treat each community facing a water crisis in isolation. in my state of california, we are enduring the worst drought in over a century. farmland has been fallowed, families are forced to cut back on water consumption, and some are out of water completely. they have to travel to community centers for drinking water or to even take showers and brush their teeth. with each passing day, month, and year, our situation becomes more desperate. as we all know, the drought is an act of nature. it is one of those troubles that we can respond to and prepare for but not prevent. yet our own government, the federal government, has not only failed to prepare for this drought, they have exacerbated it. water that could have been used in homes or on farms has been sent out to sea. water that could have been stored by building new reservoirs was lost. water, our most precious resource, has been wasted. the drought may be our biggest challenge, but its destructive effects have been compounded by stubborn regulatory and legal restraints. in california, rather than strive to bring people water, the state government is taking it away. this is more than incompetence. government has failed in its primary duty to make sure people have that which is necessary for life. the people of california have put into the system, and they are not getting what they deserve, are due. but today, and in large part thanks to members on both sides of the aisle in this chamber and the senior senator of our golden state with their good faith negotiation and partnership, water is coming. we now have a bipartisan water bill. it is not the holistic one that this house wants to pass, but it is a bill that helps deliver water to our communities, potentially enough to supply the annual needs of almost 450,000 households in california. it will increase pumping; it will increase storage; it will fund more desalinization, efficiency, and recycling projects; and it will do all of this in accordance with the endangered species act and without costing the taxpayer one additional cent. our work to bring california water is by no means complete, but this deal shows that we have a path forward to fulfill our obligation to the american people. once we pass this bill today, i urge senate democrats and republicans and the president to join with the house and enact this bill and help our communities in california, in flint, and across this country get access to the water we desperately need. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, how much time is remaining on both sides? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from oregon has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. the gentleman from pennsylvania has 4\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. thompson). mr. thompson of california. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, if this bill did what the previous speaker just said, i would be here to speak in favor of it. unfortunately, this legislation is a giant leap in the wrong direction with the potential to undo all that our state has worked for. it sends operations mandates from washington to water managers who have carefully balanced water allocation across users for the past 5 years of this terrible drought. it pits regions against each other. it reignites the water wars, which our state has struggled with for generations. [[page h7489]] {time} 1115 though the authors have provided authorization for critical water infrastructure, they have prioritized huge water storage projects without enough congressional oversight. the bill also leaves the door open for the federal funding for our state's delta tunnels proposal, which is highly controversial in california; and funding for this measure, if it happens at all, would be left to the mercy of the republican-controlled spending committees. funding is not guaranteed for these projects. most fundamentally, this provision violates the bedrock environmental laws that protect ecosystems not just in california, but nationwide. when lawmakers overrule biological opinions--the determination of scientists about what is best for a species--the science-based management ecosystems everywhere are undermined. the consequences could be catastrophic. we have seen it before. in 2002, we ignored science and diverted water out of the klamath river, killing nearly 80,000 spawning salmon. communities were devastated and livelihoods were lost. we cannot afford to set a precedent. this is a bad provision of an otherwise good bill, and i urge a ``no'' vote. mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. farenthold). mr. farenthold. i thank the chairman. mr. speaker, i am here today to support the wiin act. we have heard from both sides. it is a bipartisan bill. nobody likes everything in it, which is typical of legislation in washington, but it is absolutely critical to this country--to jobs and our economy. in fact, in the district i represent, there are over 76,000 jobs associated with ports and waterways in the area. i would venture to say, however, 100 percent of the population is touched in the products that they buy, in the goods that they produce, and in the raw materials that are shipped. this is a good bill that cuts redtape and gets our port projects going. it is what we need for our economy and it is what we need for america. i urge my colleagues to support it. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i thank all of the staff who worked so hard on this legislation, particularly the majority and minority staff of the subcommittee on water resources and environment. we would not be here today without the hard work of ryan seiger and mike brain on my staff and of others on the other side of the aisle. mr. speaker, i yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from ohio (ms. kaptur). ms. kaptur. mr. speaker, i rise in solidarity and in championing the cause of the steelworkers of our nation and of the industrial heartland of lorain, ohio, and gary, indiana, and youngstown. apparently, the republican majority was not paying attention to the recent election because, in fact, mr. trump promised that the buy american provision and american steel production would be supportive and primary; yet they are proposing to kill the buy american provision in this bill. i urge the majority not to forget the promises its party made to these proud and strong american workers. i can assure the majority they will not forget. we also have to stand up to chinese dumping that has put out of work thousands and thousands and thousands of workers across this country. given the woes of the american steel industry, encouraging more offshoring is unconscionable. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from south carolina (mr. sanford). mr. sanford. i thank the gentleman. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this bill. i thank the chairman for his work and for the committee's work on this bill in the way that, in essence, it creates a lighthouse on how we might fund infrastructure projects going forward. there is much talk about the new trump administration and what will come next on that front, but what will be important is the process in the way that we fund infrastructure. we can have our different takes on what should or should not happen in california, but if you look at the bill in its totality, it sets in place a process that, i think, is vital. second, it is important to take things off the christmas tree, and this bill does that. i praise the chairman for what he has done. he deauthorized $10 billion worth of projects. that is something we do not often see in washington, d.c., and it is something we need to see more of. finally, i thank the gentleman for the way that he focused on charleston. any time one can count a resource on one hand, it is a natural resource. indeed, that is the case with the port in charleston, which i think will go to serve needs, along with a number of other ports on the gulf and the east coast, as the panama canal has been widened. mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. graves). mr. graves of louisiana. i thank the chairman and the ranking member for all of their work on this legislation, particularly on the water resources component. mr. speaker, you can look at water resource policy across the united states, whether it is building levees or it is restoring the coast. we have one of the most expensive and one of the most delayed processes for implementing infrastructure projects in the nation. this bill begins to correct that process. it begins to expedite it. it begins to give better local control. it begins to provide people protection. it begins to restore the environment. just in august of this year, mr. speaker, we had one of the worst floods in u.s. history that will result in billions of dollars in flooding. we simply could have spent millions, once again, in preventing the flooding from happening, thus saving lives and saving this country billions of dollars. so i urge the adoption of the bill. i want to quickly say that the west shore project authorized in here and the environmental banks are critical and are going to result in much protection and efficiency. mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i appreciate all of the work that has gone into this bill, especially by the staff on both sides of the committee. there were a lot of hours that they put in, and i cannot thank them enough for what they did. again, i thank my counterpart, the gentleman from oregon (mr. defazio), for his efforts on the bill as well as the ranking member's and the subcommittee chairman's. i urge all of my colleagues to support s. 612, or the wiin act, so we can improve our ports, our harbors, and can protect this nation from flooding and natural disasters. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. bucshon. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of s. 612, the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act, and i urge my colleagues to join me in that support. as everyone knows, families in flint, michigan, have not been able to trust the drinking water coming out of their taps for more than 2 years, and bottled water and filters are only temporary solutions. they want answers, and they want results. the package before us includes legislation that will authorize funding to help improve the health of the people in flint and in other communities who have had federal emergencies declared due to there being unsafe levels of lead in their drinking water. specifically, this package authorizes $100 million in safe drinking water act capitalization grants to states that respond to a presidentially declared disaster for health threats posed by their drinking water. this bipartisan package also expresses that $20 million should be approved under the water infrastructure finance and innovation act for eligible projects. it authorizes $20 million for the creation of a lead registry and advisory committee at the department of hhs, and it authorizes an additional $15 million in appropriations for the childhood lead poisoning prevention program at the cdc. it also authorizes $15 million for the healthy start initiative at the department of hhs. this fully offset package will not only serve as the basis for responding to decaying lead service lines across [[page h7490]] the country, but will also directly respond to the tragic toll that has been taken on the minds and bodies of flint's youngest victims due to repeated exposures to elevated concentrations of lead in drinking water. we must pass this authorization to ensure the appropriation proposed in the continuing resolution does what we want it to do, not what the epa might come up with for that funding. as for the other parts of the wiin act, they are not perfect, but they represent a bipartisan, bicameral compromise that i expect the president to sign. under the jurisdiction of the energy and commerce committee, there are several other proposals that address lead and other contaminants in drinking water: wiin includes the public notification provisions that the house passed this past february with 412 votes. specifically, it requires public water systems to notify their customers if the utility, on a systemwide basis, is exceeding the federal lead action level for the concentration of lead in its drinking water. if the water utility and the state fail to make the notice, then the epa must advise the public. these provisions also call for the creation of a strategic plan between the epa, the state, and the local water utility for household- specific notification if the epa learns about a particular household getting water above the federal lead action level. this legislation also targets assistance to small and economically disadvantaged communities, particularly those communities with any kind of formal plumbing or inadequate water delivery service. beyond flint, wiin institutes a new program to help communities finance activities to reduce the lead in their treated drinking water. the priority for these grants goes to economically disadvantaged communities that have concentrations of lead in their drinking water that exceed federal standards. this bill also provides grants to states for voluntary testing programs for lead in school and childcare center drinking water systems. there are other worthy provisions that are contained in this bill that i urge my colleagues to look into, but i want to mention two of them: buy american iron and steel and state permitting for coal ash. while these provisions have been carried in appropriations bills for years, wiin inserts a requirement into the safe drinking water act that iron and steel used in projects financed with federal money have to be primarily made in the united states. this language sends a strong signal that congress supports american businesses and workers and will not allow foreign competitors to use our markets as a dumping ground for cheap products. concerning coal ash, after 6 years of trying, we are close to reaching our goal of enacting legislation to establish permit programs for coal ash. the language in wiin provides for the establishment of state and epa permit programs, which will alleviate the issue of the citizen suit enforcement of the epa's final rule. like past house proposals, states may incorporate the epa final rule for coal combustion residuals or develop other criteria that are at least as protective as the final rule. {time} 1130 states and utilities alike are supportive of the language. i commend our colleague, david mckinley, for his dogged determination on this issue and our water resources and environment subcommittee chairman john shimkus for their work on this subject. in summary, mr. speaker, this bill is, on balance, better than the status quo, and it is done in a more fiscally responsible way than the version that passed the other body: no direct spending, fully offset, and in line with house rules and protocols. it addresses critical issues facing our nation in both water infrastructure and drinking water policy. it is worthy of our support, and it will benefit all americans. i urge a ``yes'' vote on s. 612. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. tonko. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, this bill is far from perfect. it has some very good provisions and others that i oppose. i rise today to highlight the particular sections i worked on to get included in this bill. i have worked across the aisle with my colleagues in the past on similar drinking water issues, and i have been asking my e&c colleagues for a hearing on broader reforms to the safe drinking water act through this entire session. while we have not been successful in having a hearing, i remain optimistic that my colleagues on the other side will make this a top priority next year. with that said, the bill before us today includes a number of provisions very similar to language authored by myself, by ranking member pallone, and many of our democratic colleagues contained within the aqua act and the safe drinking water act amendments of 2016. we know communities and low-income homeowners need assistance replacing lead service lines. this bill authorizes a new $300 million grant program to get lead out of our communities. it gives priority to schools, to childcare centers, and other facilities that serve children. the bill also makes it easier for states to administer federal funds. in addition to these provisions from the aqua act, there are a number of other positive things included in this bill. we have heard about the struggles of small and disadvantaged communities. in my district, the mayor of castleton, joseph keegan, testified that his community needs help but simply cannot afford a loan. he suggested allowing grants. this bill includes a significant grant program specifically for that purpose. it also gives more flexibility for tribal governments and encourages innovative technologies. the bill improves public notification requirements when a system violates the lead and copper rule, an issue the gentleman from michigan (mr. kildee) has fought for to help prevent another tragedy like that in flint. and it includes an authorization for a program to help schools test for lead. unfortunately, this bill fails to make sufficient commitments to buy american. we must include stronger buy american language in the statutes. finally, i am disheartened to see such a divisive bit of language on california water issues added at the last minute. it is frustrating to see a good bill, negotiated in good faith, get loaded up with a poison pill at the end. ultimately, this bill has taken some good first steps to invest in our nation's water systems and provide the city of flint with the assistance it needs and deserves. but much more is needed. some $384 billion is required over the next 20 years to simply keep up our drinking water systems, and 18 million americans live in communities that violated the lead and copper rule in 2015. we must, and we can, do better. it is time to get to work. there are many more provisions included in the aqua act that i hope this body seriously considers moving forward. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. bucshon. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. mcnerney). mr. mcnerney. mr. speaker, i have witnessed a pattern of attacks against the endangered species act as well as attacks on our industries and communities that rely on the california delta. house republicans continue to attach environmentally damaging california water riders to every single piece of legislation that is moving on this floor. this time, it is on s. 612, the wiin act, also known as the wrda bill. this highly controversial language was developed behind closed doors, and it jeopardizes the senate bipartisan bill that senator boxer and senator inhofe have worked on very hard, but senator boxer is now willing to sacrifice all that work to stop this bill. i strongly support the original bill, which includes some very good stuff. i also want to recognize mr. kildee, my colleague who has worked very hard on behalf of his constituents in flint, michigan. i support the provisions in this bill that will provide assistance to the drinking water crisis in flint and other areas of the nation that need upgraded drinking water infrastructure. but as long as the california so-called drought language remains, my state and the pacific coast are at risk. [[page h7491]] this california water rider would further degrade the california delta. it weakens protections for california fisheries; threatens thousands of fishing industry jobs, as we have heard, even up to the coast of oregon; increases saltwater intrusion; and it picks winners and losers in my state. this provision will provide freedom to export water above and beyond what the esa currently allows. this will cause further saltwater intrusion into the delta. you know, farmers do not benefit when saltwater contaminates our water supplies. if we truly believe in sound science, we should not override science with local interests that do not represent the entire state. the administration and its agencies have serious concerns with this language. this rider will not create a path forward for effective operations but, instead, will create a firestorm of litigation. environmental organizations, the fishing industry, the fisheries believe this language will devastate our way of life on the pacific coast. i, along with california, oregon, and washington members, have urged the house and senate leadership to reject similar riders in the past. i have had an opportunity to submit amendments to strip these riders in the past, but we do not have that opportunity today. the speaker pro tempore (mr. holding). the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. mr. mcnerney. republicans should not hold funding for water infrastructure projects hostage. instead of pitting communities against each other, we need to support conservation, storm water capture, and innovative recycling programs. we need real drought solutions that will actually improve water supply. this is not a compromise. it sets a precedent for the next administration to further unravel environmental protections. i urge a ``no'' vote. mr. bucshon. mr. speaker, may i ask how much time i have remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from indiana has 5 minutes remaining. mr. bucshon. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from north dakota (mr. cramer). mr. cramer. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, the wiin act includes two provisions very important to constituents of mine in north dakota that involve bureau of land management properties; and because of the house rules, i was unable to put these provisions in the house wrda act. however, senator hoeven was able to get them into the senate bill; and, with the strong support of committee leadership and staff, we were able to work it out and get them in the final bill. one provision concludes an issue that has been going on for years that involves the continued use of trailer homes around lake tschida, or the heart butte reservoir. the requirements set in this provision will increase safety while supporting existing investments and continued recreation around the lake. the other deals with a more recent issue that has arisen lately of looming fee increases at cabins and trailers at three north dakota blm reservoirs: the heart butte, dickinson, and jamestown. because market rent surveys were not completed for many years, and then the recent increases in north dakota property values, surveys completed last year concluded that the fees would have to be increased 91 to 232 percent overnight. obviously, my constituents would be hit too hard by that, so this bill helps correct that and brings a smoother transition. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. kildee). mr. kildee. mr. speaker, i thank my friend from new york (mr. tonko) for yielding and for his work advocating on behalf of the people of my hometown, flint. i also want to thank colleagues on both sides of the aisle: leader pelosi; our whip, mr. hoyer; the speaker who committed to help make sure that we get this flint provision through; as well as other colleagues who have stood with me as i have fought now for a year and a half for the people of my hometown. flint is a city of 100,000 people who still cannot drink their water. this is not a question of access to water. the water flowing through the pipes in flint has poisoned that city: 100,000 people, 9,000 children under the age of 6 affected permanently by high levels of lead being delivered to them through their municipal water system, caused by careless, thoughtless decisions based on an obsession with austerity by the state government. and then they were told the water was safe to drink, when that same state government knew it was not. look, we know where we stand. no bill is perfect. this bill is far from perfect. many of the provisions included in this legislation i disagree with. but i have been fighting for my hometown and have been told to wait and wait and wait, and the people of my community can wait no longer. drinking water is a basic human right, and that should be a human right exercised by the people everywhere, including the people of my hometown of flint. every day that passes, every week that passes, every month that passes that flint does not get the relief they so deserve is a day we do not get back. more people leave. more businesses fail. the city gets more poor and poor and poor and incapable of moving forward. that has to stop, and it has to stop right now. it has to stop before this congress adjourns. we cannot count on the next congress to get this done. time matters. this bill would provide relief to my hometown. it would put it on a path, and it would send a signal that it is okay to invest in flint. it is okay to stay. the water will be fine. that is a responsibility we have. this is a moral obligation that we have. it also makes sure that there is no more flints, by including in this legislation the kildee-upton bill that passed this house nearly unanimously. it is long past time for us to act. i ask you to join me in supporting this legislation. mr. bucshon. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from montana (mr. zinke). mr. zinke. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of the wiin act, which includes one of my top priorities in congress, the blackfeet water compact. i cannot stress how important this compact is to the blackfeet nation, a nation of warriors; the state of montana; and our great nation, the united states. not only has the compact receive the necessary and long signoff that involved federal agencies, the house natural resources committee, and house leadership, it is a net benefit to the american taxpayer. i want to commend the blackfeet warriors for all their hard work, especially chairman harry barnes for his guidance and leadership, and also chairman bishop for his leadership. i urge my colleagues in the house and senate to put politics aside and pass this bill. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, how much time do i have remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from new york has 1\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pallone), the ranking member of the committee on energy and commerce who is doing a great job leading us in the house. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i oppose the wiin act in its current form. the decision by republican leadership to include damaging legislation on california water in an otherwise good, bipartisan bill is deeply disappointing. members and staff have devoted months to the underlying package, including long overdue aid for the people of flint. but i cannot support the california water poison pill, and i know that many of my colleagues in the senate are in the same position. i want to thank leader pelosi and whip hoyer for working tirelessly over the last few months to develop this package and over the last few days to save it. i hope this is not the end of the story. we have tried for years on the energy and commerce committee, mr. speaker, to get our republican colleagues to work with us to strengthen the safe drinking water act and provide more money for infrastructure, but they have refused. so i welcomed the senate's bipartisan passage of an [[page h7492]] expanded wrda that included some valuable changes to the safe drinking water act and significant new authorizations for infrastructure, and i was pleasantly surprised that house republicans agreed to some of the changes and authorizations in that bill. however, the drinking water provisions in this bill fall short of what was included in the senate wrda bill; most notably, republicans refuse to support a permanent requirement that projects funded through the srf use american iron and steel. that requirement should not be controversial. it has been enacted through the appropriations process for years and has clear benefits for american workers and the american economy. {time} 1145 house democrats have proposed significant changes to the safe drinking water act that go far beyond this bill, including changes needed to address dangerous drinking water contaminants and the risks to drinking water from climate change. ignoring these challenges will not make them go away. house republicans need to face these challenges in the coming months and not undermine our efforts with poison pills. mr. bucshon. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. upton), the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i rise this morning in support of s. 612, the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act, and i would urge every one of my colleagues to join me in that support. as everybody knows, families in flint, michigan, have not been able to trust the drinking water coming out of their taps for more than 2 years. bottled water and filters are only temporary solutions. in august, i traveled to flint with my friend and colleague dan kildee from michigan. we visited health facilities and homes, and we heard firsthand from hundreds of residents. no matter where we went, we heard the same voices. folks in flint are tired of the partisan blame game. they really are. they wanted answers and they wanted results, and that is what this bill does. that is why we worked so hard to have language included in this bipartisan legislation that will authorize funding to help improve the health of the folks in flint and other communities who have had federal emergencies declared due to the unsafe levels of lead in their drinking water. our package authorizes $100 million in safe drinking water act capitalization grants to states responding to a presidentially declared disaster for health threats associated with the presence of lead or other drinking water contaminants in a public water system. this bipartisan package also expresses that $20 million should be approved under the water infrastructure finance and innovation act for eligible projects. it authorizes $20 million for the creation of a lead registry and advisory committee at the department of hhs and authorizes an additional $15 million appropriation for the childhood lead poisoning prevention act at cdc. it authorizes $15 million for the healthy start initiative at the department of hhs. it also authorizes 30 new army corps of engineers projects across the country, including critical harbor maintenance provisions that are vitally important in the great lakes. this fully offset package will not only serve as the basis for responding to decaying lead service lines across the country, but also responds to the tragic toll that has been taken on the minds and bodies of flint's youngest victims and similar communities due to repeated exposures to elevated concentrations of lead in drinking water. simply put, flint needs action. this bipartisan legislation delivers that. i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' mr. bucshon. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. lance). mr. lance. mr. speaker, i rise today in very strong support of the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act, which will provide critical resources to address the needs of our waterway infrastructure directly affecting communities' economy and safety. communities i represent have suffered from chronic flooding, and i am proud to have worked with municipal leaders in cranford, kenilworth, maplewood, millburn, rahway, springfield, and union, new jersey, to include authorization language in this legislation that will complete the rahway river basin flood risk management feasibility study. for years, these new jersey communities have pursued this project based on its great merits that will protect life and property. i have toured these communities and seen firsthand how the solution must come from collaboration between local leaders, state entities, and the federal government, including the army corps of engineers. this legislation gives the army corps the directive to get it done. this is how congress should work, heeding the call of our constituents and building bipartisan consensus to make sure that this legislation passes. i congratulate all those responsible. mr. bucshon. mr. speaker, i urge the passage of s. 612. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. bishop of utah. mr. speaker, i yield myself 2 minutes. one of the things we have to realize is we have had communities that have been suffering for a long time. our job is to help people. we should be ashamed that it has taken us so long to try and move to a solution in these particular issues. what we have before us here is not a total solution, but it is a very, very good first step, and not just for the arid west. there are 17 western states that will be assisted by this bill, but 29 states as well as indian country are going to be helped, especially as they try to repair their aging dams and their irrigation canals. we are finalizing native american water rights settlements in california, oklahoma, and montana; doing land exchanges; helping with forestry management in the nevada area; giving flexibility for californians under the principle that, if it is going to rain, capture the water before it is lost to the ocean; having alternative end-water development programs like desalinization. all of these are done without undermining the endangered species act. i say that not as a virtue of the bill, but simply as a fact. this bill in which we find some compromise between the senate and the house, between republicans and democrats, is a final way of us being able to actually move forward. let us make sure that we take ``yes'' as an answer. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. huffman. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. wrda has always been a bipartisan piece of legislation. i have always voted for wrda. i voted for this wrda earlier in this congress before a 90-page poison pill, california water provision, was dropped in at the very last minute. mr. speaker, unfortunately, i must rise today in opposition to this wrda in its current form. i urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on it and force a vote on a clean wrda so that we can have the many projects, the many benefits, the aid to the people of flint, michigan, that they so richly deserve and have waited far too long to receive. we are here, mr. speaker, because, unfortunately, the house republicans have a problem with regular order. it is something that they have talked a lot about. we have heard many promises about an open legislative process, and yet here they come again with the latest attempt to jam through dangerous california water provisions that were crafted behind closed doors, without public review or scrutiny, and they are being thrown on the house floor literally in the final hours of this congress. let us not forget that this same last-minute, closed-door maneuver, the same water grab, nearly torpedoed last year's must-pass spending bill. by insisting on this parochial poison pill, majority leadership is apparently willing to risk tanking the wrda bill no matter the damage to the families of flint who have been waiting far too long, no matter the harm to fishing communities across the west, no matter how many jobs that would be created by wrda might have to wait until the mccarthy rider is dealt with. this power play feels a lot like deja vu. today, yet again, we are debating a [[page h7493]] california water measure that has not gone through the committee of jurisdiction or received sign-off from the affected tribal interests, the fishing industry, or state and federal water agencies. while this congress was never given the opportunity to receive expert testimony on these provisions, we do know that the obama administration just this week announced its strong opposition to the california water provisions that have been added to this bill. senator boxer, one of the primary authors of the wrda bill before it was hijacked with this rider, has also called these provisions a last-minute poison pill, and she has vowed to do everything in her power to block this bill in the senate. mr. speaker, we have heard significant opposition to this rider from other stakeholders who have warned this congress that thousands of fishing industry jobs across the pacific coast will be threatened if this bill is enacted. but i do have to hand it to my colleagues across the aisle about one thing: they are relentless. this rider is simply the latest of many attempts to pick winners and losers during california's historic drought. if it is enacted, the winners in this effort will certainly be some of the most powerful, politically active corporate farmers in the world. consider one group of water stakeholders, one group of contractors in one specific region. now, this bill may call itself a drought solution, and we may talk about many different parts of it, but tucked into the details is a congressionally directed 100 percent water allocation for one group of water contractors. that is one heck of a drought solution if you have got the political juice to get it into a bill like this. fishery protections, meanwhile, will be gutted in order to redistribute water supplies, primarily to large industrial farms in the central valley. let us talk about the losers in this effort. it is going to be pretty much everyone else. the california water rider will weaken fisheries protections that support thousands of jobs in numerous industries, including commercial and recreational fishing, fish processing, restaurants, docks and harbors, boating, equipment supply, and tourism. pretty much everyone across the pacific coast who depends on healthy fisheries for their livelihoods will be hurt if this poison pill is enacted. thousands of fishermen and their families are already hanging on by a thread right now. because of this drought, fishery managers have severely restricted the commercial fishing season off the west coast because of high salmon mortality in california. last year we had a 97 percent mortality rate for juvenile sacramento river winter-run salmon. the year before that it was a 95 percent mortality. these are tough times for fishermen around the west. they are struggling to pay their mortgages. we have heard about boats being scrapped because the owners cannot pay mooring fees; homes are being repossessed; restaurants, hotels, and other retail and service businesses are struggling just to scrape by. the human impact during this drought has been devastating on the many small-business owners and thousands of working people across california, washington, and oregon who depend on healthy fisheries. this is the worst time to weaken the thin line of protections for these fragile salmon fisheries. yet instead of increasing protections, as all the evidence tells us we need to do, this bill takes us in the opposite direction. now, the state of california has called for federal drought legislation that does not favor one region or one sector of the state over another. this rider unquestionably fails that test. mr. speaker, this congress can do real things to solve california's water problems without pitting parts of the state against each other. i hope one day my house republican colleagues will give up on the idea of jamming through dangerous, divisive measures that pit fishermen against farmers, that override the interests of the tribal community and numerous others who are suffering through california's historic drought. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. bishop of utah. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. valadao), one of the leaders in this particular effort. mr. valadao. mr. speaker, i first want to start off with a big thank- you to chairman bishop for all his hard work these past 4 years--it has been with his leadership and his support that we have been able to get to this point--chairman shuster as well, and, obviously, from california, majority leader kevin mccarthy has been a big supporter. this piece of legislation is a small step in the right direction. in no way, shape, or form are we celebrating as if we have reached the finish line. what this does is it helps us give a little more flexibility so we can help those poor people in my communities, and others south of me and even just a little bit north of me, who need this help desperately. i have got people in my communities living in shantytowns, people who have lost their jobs, schools struggling, infrastructure struggling, law enforcement on the verge of bankruptcy. i have got police chiefs resigning now because there are just not enough resources in these communities, all because of bad legislation that was passed. we have had 20 years of restrictions on water. it has not helped one single species. the species are on the verge of extinction, and these policies have been place. why not try something different? why not try some common sense? this legislation delivers that. it does not affect the endangered species act. it does not affect the biological opinions. all the protections are still there. it just offers a little more flexibility to our agencies so we can help these communities that desperately need it. if you care about the people of california, you will look at the big picture, you will pay attention, and you might actually even take some time and read the actual legislation. there are no handouts. this is something that actually provides jobs with new dollars for infrastructure, with new dollars for recycling and other resources that are very important, even things that i know my friends across the aisle are supportive of, things like desalinization. i think this legislation makes a lot of sense. i would love to see some more support. i am thankful for all the support i do have across the aisle, but i am hopeful for more. i look forward to this. {time} 1200 mr. huffman. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. mcnerney). mr. mcnerney. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, my region has much of the delta; i would say most of it. i am very concerned about saltwater intrusion with these new provisions. saltwater is not something that you can drink. you cannot do much with it. it is a problem. it is easy to sympathize--and i do--with the farmers and communities south of the delta, but we should not just pass the problem from one region to another. we do not need to do this. we can develop recycling. israel recycles 90 percent of their water. california recycles 15 percent. we can capture urban and suburban storm water. we can stop water leakage. we can reduce evaporative losses. we can start groundwater banking. we can create regional self-sufficiency, which will reduce reliance on the delta water and solve all these problems. instead, we continue to do things the old way. a region that needs water says: well, they have got water over there. we are going to get it. we are going to use our politics, our money, and we are going to get that water. who cares what they think. who cares what happens to them. by the way, adding flexibility to the operations of the esa is weakening the esa. so let us find real solutions for everyone. please oppose this bill. mr. bishop of utah. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. costa). mr. costa. mr. speaker, this is a good bill for flint, michigan. it is a good bill for wrda projects across the country. it is a good bill for california. everybody knows that we have experienced over 5 years of drought conditions, the driest in 1,200 years. [[page h7494]] i reject the notion that somehow there is a poison pill. this is a bipartisan effort that senator feinstein, house republicans, myself, and other members from california have worked on for 2 years. as a matter of fact, some of the opponents of this legislation have provisions in this measure that they supported and advocated senator feinstein insert. the obama administration drafted environmental protections, and one of the red lines was that it would not modify or amend the endangered species act, nor would it change the biological opinions. those are simply falsehoods. falsehoods. this bill authorizes $580 million to offset for storage, recycling, and reuse and desalinization. that is very important. that is part of what the last speaker just talked about: recycling and reuse and water conservation. it also provides programs to benefit fish and wildlife. it also works within the framework of the existing biological opinions. the speaker pro tempore (mr. dold). the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. bishop of utah. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. mr. costa. mr. speaker, i reject the notion that these are poison pills. people in my district and in their homes and my colleagues have been without water, in some cases, for 2 years. this is not like a third world country. this is the richest country in the world, but farm communities, farmers, and farmworkers are suffering. this legislation would place a step in the right direction to provide people support to correct this broken water system that we have in california. i urge the support of this legislation not only for the people of california, but for flint, michigan, and the entire country. this is a bipartisan process and this legislation reflects that fact. mr. huffman. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, there is a reason that every environmental group that is engaged on this and the obama administration are opposing this language. it is not harmless. it is not perfectly fine with the esa. it is a congressional override of the scientific, peer-reviewed biological opinions that does grave harm to the esa and sets a terrible precedent. but there are other problems with the bill, as well. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from arizona (mr. grijalva), my colleague and ranking member of the natural resources committee. mr. grijalva. mr. speaker, i regret that, once again, we are here today to discuss a divisive, last-minute attempt by house republicans to jam through destructive legislation that favors house republicans' special interests, industry friends at the expense of everybody else. this week, i and nearly every one else saw for the first time a newly inserted 100-page rider that would weaken protections for west coast fisheries, primarily to redirect water to large corporate farms in one section of california. this rider threatens the jobs of thousands of fishermen and others across the west coast who depend on healthy fish runs for their livelihoods. my colleagues and i will be voting today, soon, on a 100-page proposal that has not been reviewed by the numerous affected stakeholders, the committees of jurisdiction, nearly every member of congress, or the general public. this rider fundamentally threatens the original wrda bill that had bipartisan support in the house and bicameral support as well. what makes things worse is this poison pill rider now jeopardizes the approval of several pending indian water rights settlements that are included in the original wrda bill. the tribes whose water settlements are now jeopardized by this poison pill have been waiting, in many cases, to settle their claims for decades and even more. just one of the water settlements jeopardized by the house republicans' latest stunt is for the blackfeet nation. the blackfeet nation, as mentioned by another colleague, has been trying for more than a century to protect and secure its water rights. finally, we have a water settlement for the blackfeet nation that, once approved by congress, would provide funding to conduct and rehabilitate blackfeet nation's water infrastructure so tribal residents can finally have reliable and safe drinking water. currently, at least 30 percent of reservation residents live in housing that lacks adequate plumbing or kitchen facilities. for the richest country in the world, it is an embarrassment that our native american brothers and sisters continue to live in those conditions. this republican house has not funded an indian water rights settlement in nearly 6 years. after years of work, we are as close as we have ever been to enacting a settlement since democrats controlled the house. yet, my house republican colleagues have decided this week that doing a favor for their special interest allies is worth the risk of jeopardizing the approval of every indian water rights settlement that is part of the original legislation. this behavior is wrong and shows that this congressional majority considers the needs of indian country less important than pushing a sweetheart deal for some of the most powerful corporate farmers in the world. it is time for this congress to finally pay attention, take the needs of indian country seriously, and bring us a clean wrda bill that has bipartisan, bicameral support so that we can take action, protect those indian water rights, and deal with the very important question of flint. mr. bishop of utah. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. lamalfa), another member of the california delegation who has been working tirelessly on this issue. mr. lamalfa. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman greatly for this opportunity, and all who have had a role in this; chairman shuster as well. this is a bipartisan effort. it truly is a bipartisan effort. i thank senator feinstein for coming forward and being a strong voice on this as well. so it is a bipartisan, bicameral effort. these long- term negotiations did not happen just overnight. indeed, since it is water in california, most of this takes many years. these provisions will modernize california's water supply system in the short term and invest in new infrastructure to secure the state's economic future--a very critical one. this agreement improves water supply for all californians. more supply helps everyone, north and south, and uses the latest science to provide more water without harming wildlife in any way. it does not harm wildlife. from a northern california perspective, this agreement achieves several major goals, including ironclad protections of northern california water rights, improving water supply reliability, and authorizes construction, finally, of sites reservoir, a key project that has been talked about for years that will help california's future supply needs. while this bill is a significant step in the right direction, it is not the be-all and end-all. it is not the comprehensive solution. it is a compromise. no one gets everything they want. any honest observer will recognize that this agreement provides more water and does so without altering the endangered species act or other environmental requires. it deserves your sport. those that are opposed to it seem to be just on the fringe, far edge of the environmental movement. let us get this done. i enjoy the fact that we have all come together, by and large, for a strong bipartisan effort. mr. bishop of utah. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. mcclintock), who is one of our subcommittee chairmen on the natural resources committee. mr. mcclintock. i thank the chairman for yielding. mr. speaker, like any compromise, i do not like everything in this bill, but the net effect is an important step forward in protecting california and its environment against devastating droughts, and it protects lake tahoe against catastrophic wildfires. my colleague from california says the california provisions are a sudden surprise to him in this water development bill. well, he needs to pay more attention to the business on the floor. these provisions have all been in water development bills passed by bipartisan majorities from this house over the past 6 years. if he were truly concerned about the salmon, he should be supporting this [[page h7495]] bill. this bill encourages the fish hatcheries to produce burgeoning and abundant populations of salmon. it finally controls the nonnative predators in the delta that are, by far, the biggest single threat to salmon and smelt and other endangered species. the reservoirs are our most important defense against drought, ensuring year-round water flows. without reservoirs, in a drought, the water heats to lethal temperatures and often dries up. there are no fish. in addition, this bill provides $335 million to increase our desperately needed reservoirs. it adds flexibility to management of the new melones reservoir. it streamlines water transfers to assure water can be more efficiently moved to where it is most needed. it adds strong protection to the northern california area of origin water rights, expedites approval of projects, and updates flood control criteria to make better use of our existing reservoirs. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. bishop of utah. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. mr. mcclintock. one more point on our fragile environment. this bill addresses the single greatest catastrophic threat to lake tahoe-- catastrophic wildfire--by expediting the reduction of dangerous fuel loads. mr. speaker, i urge its adoption. mr. huffman. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. bishop of utah. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, let me say in conclusion that we have been talking about this issue for the last 5 years. we have had four bills that have been brought forth on this issue. we passed this one this year as well. one would assume by a lot of the discussion you just heard that this is only a california issue. it is not. these provisions affect the entire west and entire nation; 29 states. it affects my state, and i am not from california. it is important. it is based on the simple, commonsense idea that when it rains, store the water before you lose it to the ocean. that is there. mr. speaker, i include in the record a letter from ducks unlimited supporting this bill. i think they are going to be happy to know that i guess they are not an environmental group anymore. ducks unlimited, december 6, 2016. president barack obama, the white house, washington, dc. dear mr. president: ducks unlimited (du) is supportive of the water infrastructure improvements for the nation (wien) act. on behalf of our more than one million members and supporters nationwide, du has worked closely with senator feinstein over the past two years to ensure that water and water rights critical to california's wildlife refuges were not diminished in california drought legislation. we believe the drought provisions now included in the wiin act safeguard existing water rights and take important steps toward improving the distribution of water to wildlife refuges in the central valley. water supply development takes a great toll on wetlands and any new water supply legislation must not further exacerbate this trend. the central valley project improvement act (cvpia) was a critical step toward mitigating the environmental damage caused by decades of large-scale water development in california. a sustainable water future requires diligent preservation of that mitigation program, plus new innovations in water supply resilience. specifically, the bill protects water supplies for central valley project (cvp) wildlife refuges by including refuge contractors in its water right provisions, and by expressly protecting the department of interior's obligations under the cvpia. it authorizes an additional $10 million in funding over five years to improve refuge water conveyance infrastructure. implementation of this bill would likely increase the reliability of refuge water supplies delivered by the department of interior through the sacramento-san joaquin delta. it also authorizes funding for water storage projects that provide federal benefits, including wildlife refuge benefits. california annually hosts one of the greatest concentrations of migratory waterfowl in north america, serving as the wintering home to millions of waterfowl, shorebirds and other wetland-dependent species. the majority of migratory birds that frequent alaska, washington and oregon spend their winters in california, especially on winter-flooded rice fields. rice agriculture in california plays a crucial role in fulfilling the annual life cycle needs of numerous pacific flyway birds. these migratory visitors provide countless hours of enjoyment to hunters and birdwatchers throughout the pacific flyway. as a result, migratory waterfowl are also an important economic driver across the region, especially in california. sportsmen, including waterfowlers, contribute $3.5 billion annually to california's economy. the birds of the pacific flyway are a shared resource, requiring the stewardship of not only california, but of all western states, as well as canada and mexico, as they migrate thousands of miles between their breeding grounds and winter homes. please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding our assessment of the california drought provisions in the wiin act and their importance to california's wildlife refuges and the millions of birds in the pacific flyway that visit these wetland habitats each year. sincerely, h. dale hall, chief executive officer, ducks unlimited. mr. bishop of utah. mr. speaker, i also would like to realize that there are native american water rights that have been included in this bill in montana, in oklahoma, and in california, to the point that the national congress of american indians has also endorsed this bill, which i include in the record. december 7, 2016. hon. mitch mcconnell, majority leader, u.s. senate, washington, dc. hon. harry reid, minority leader, u.s. senate, washington, dc. hon. paul d. ryan, speaker of the house, house of representatives, washington, dc. hon. nancy pelosi, minority leader, house of representatives, washington, dc. re support for s. 612--the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act dear majority leader mcconnell, speaker ryan, minority leader reid, and minority leader pelosi: on behalf of the national congress of american indians (ncai), the united south and eastern tribes (uset) sovereignty protection fund, and the inter tribal association of arizona (itaa), we write to urge this congress to pass s. 612--the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act (wiin act). the wiin act contains many provisions that will benefit indian country's water infrastructure, provide access to clean drinking water and improvements to waste water systems, settle several tribal water rights claims, and provide parity for tribal nations in water resources development projects. first, s. 612 enhances the ability of tribal nations to address water infrastructure projects that benefit their citizens. tide i of the act amends section 1156 of the water resources development act making tribes eligible for the cost sharing waiver for water resources development projects, and extends this waiver to tribes for assistance with water planning. tribes can also request feasibility studies on water resources development projects and enter into partnerships and cooperative agreements with the army corps of engineers (corps) regarding water resources data. further, alaska native villages, regional corporations, and village corporations will be able to enter into agreements to construct water projects. with the recent national focus on tribal concerns regarding the infrastructure permitting process at the corps, the wiin act allows for a full review of the corps' procedures. the bill requires the corps to conduct tribal consultations and issue a report to congress within 1 year on how its existing policies, regulations, and guidance related to tribal consultation on water resources development projects, or activities requiring the issuance of a permit, many have an impact on tribal cultural or natural resources. title i also repatriates the remains of the ancient one (kennewick man) back to the tribes who have claimed him so he can be respectfully treated and properly buried pursuant to traditional practices. the ancient one's repatriation is a longstanding request from indian country and will put an end to the disrespectful treatment of his ancestral remains and allow for healing to begin. further, several sections of title ii of s. 612 allow tribal nations to build technical capacity and self- sufficiency in administering water programs and projects. the legislation amends the safe drinking water act (sdwa) to ensure the availability of funding for tribal water and waste water operator training and certification programs for tribal organizations and tribal consortia, which already have provided over 2,500 certifications to personnel employed by approximately 115 tribal nations. it also creates a new section in sdwa to provide assistance to small and disadvantaged communities to prioritize projects in consultation with tribes, states, and local governments. additionally, s. 612 recognizes the outstanding maintenance and repair needs for [[page h7496]] existing water infrastructure projects in indian country. title iii contains a provision on indian dams, based on s. 2717--the drift act, which addresses the deferred maintenance needs of bureau of indian affairs dams, reforms the corps' tribal partnership program to pay for feasibility studies for flood mitigation and prevention in indian country, and creates a tribal safety of dams committee. this title also provides for the much needed repair, replacement, and maintenance of back logged indian irrigation programs in the west by creating an indian irrigation fund at the bureau of reclamation based on s. 438--the irrigate act. the wiin act will also finalize water rights settlements for the pechanga band of luiseno mission indians, blackfeet nation, the choctaw nation of oklahoma and the chickasaw nation, and amendment to the san luis rey band of mission indians' water settlement. moreover, it takes land into trust for the tuolumne band of me-wuk indians, tule river indian tribe, and exchanges land for the morongo band of mission indians. finally, s. 612 contains a mechanism for the environmental protection agency to reimburse costs incurred by tribes, states, and local governments after the gold king mine spill in august of 2015. while these are just selected highlights from the legislation, the wiin act takes great steps towards improving water infrastructure programs and development in indian country. ncai, uset sovereignty protection fund, and itaa strongly urge you to consider and pass s. 612 in the last legislative days of the 114th congress to resolve many important water-related concerns of tribal nations. if you have any questions, please contact colby duren, ncai staff attorney & legislative counsel. sincerely, brian cladoosby, president, national congress of american indians. kirk francis, president, united south and eastern tribes sovereignty protection fund. shan lewis, president, inter tribal association of arizona, vice- chairman, fort mojave indian tribe. mr. bishop of utah. mr. speaker, these things are important, but the goal right here is to realize we are not after fear-mongering. we are after ways we can actually help people. that is the goal. help our communities. that has to take place. i am appreciative that the senior senator from california, dianne feinstein, a democrat, as well as the majority leader in the house, mr. mccarthy, a republican, have all agreed on this package. we are the states where all of a sudden, in a bipartisan and bicameral way, we have found a solution to move us forward. that is why i am saying, when the answer is yes, let us take yes. vote ``yes'' on this provision, vote ``yes'' on this bill. it moves us forward. it is not a solution that is perfect, but it moves us forward in a way we have not been able to do in the last decade. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. gene green of texas. mr. speaker, i rise in support of s. 612, that reauthorizes the water resource development act. wrda is once again a bipartisan bill with broad support. this bill protects and develops our communities and our waterways. as one of many members who represent a major port, i know firsthand that ports are enormous economic engines for growth. the port of houston has allowed houston and harris county to be the energy capital of the world. the jobs and economic growth, including refining and manufacturing, associated with the port are a driver for the entire region. this wrda bill provides essential federal support for the houston ship channel dredging to 50 feet which will allow for larger, deeper draft ships that will increase trade at america's second busiest port. the bill also modernizes how partners can work with the army corps of engineers to develop projects for local and national benefit as we move forward. additionally, flood control projects in this bill preserve our communities that are facing increased hazards from record rainfall and rising sea levels. the support for the brays bayou project will help shield areas that have been devastated by deadly flooding earlier this year. i am proud to support a bipartisan bill that both supports our economic development and protects our vulnerable communities. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise in support of s. 612, the ``water infrastructure improvement act,'' as amended, which authorizes variety of u.s. army corps of engineers water resources development projects, feasibility studies, and relationships with nonfederal project sponsors. i thank chairman shuster and ranking member defazio for their work in shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment to addressing the needs of america's harbors, locks, dams, flood protection, and other water resources infrastructure critical to the nation's health, economic competitiveness and growth. i am pleased that the bill before us provides authorization for several water projects critical to my state of texas: 1. brazos river, fort bend county, texas.--project for flood damage reduction in the vicinity of the brazos river, fort bend county, texas. 2. chacon creek, city of laredo, texas.--project for flood damage reduction, ecosystem restoration, and recreation, chacon creek, city of laredo, texas. 3. corpus christi ship channel, texas.--project for navigation, corpus christi ship channel, texas. 4. city of el paso, texas.--project for flood damage reduction, city of el paso, texas. 5. gulf intracoastal waterway, brazoria and matagorda counties, texas.--project for navigation and hurricane and storm damage reduction, gulf intracoastal waterway, brazoria and matagorda counties, texas. 6. port of bay city, texas.--project for navigation, port of bay city, texas. additionally, the bill includes changes to the safe drinking water act and the solid waste disposal act to help communities, particularly economically distressed ones, pursue better quality drinking water and obtain certainty for protecting a community's economic, environmental, and public health well-being in the following ways: 1. empowers small and economically disadvantaged communities to improve their drinking water services; 2. equips communities with programs and activities to reduce concentrations of lead in drinking water, including the replacement of lead service lines; 3. empowers states and provides flexibility to incorporate underserved communities that have inadequate drinking water systems, and aids smaller, lower-income communities, tribes, and states in water quality testing and general compliance with safe drinking water act requirements; 4. benefits communities by requiring public water systems to notify customers if the utility is exceeding federal drinking water lead action levels, similar to h.r. 4470 which passed the house 416-2; 5. creates a voluntary program for testing for lead in school and childcare center drinking water; 6. promotes transparency and accountability by creating a clearinghouse of public information on the cost-effectiveness of alternative drinking water delivery systems, including systems that are supported by wells; and 7. authorizes research on innovative water technologies, including those that identify and mitigate sources of drinking water contamination and improve compliance with the safe drinking water act. mr. speaker, i am also very pleased that the bill before us addresses the need of funding that flint, michigan has been experiencing, authorizing $170,000,000 to be used to repair or replace private infrastructure in communities that the president has declared to be in an emergency. for the past two years, flint, michigan has lived in a state of fear, having to drink from bottles of filtered water in order to completely avoid lead poisoning and contamination. citizens of flint, michigan had to abandon their homes and the residents had to be compensated for their property as well as be provided for regarding current and future health conditions that arise from the contamination by polluted water. wired magazine estimated that most of the corroded pipes in flint-- 20,000 to 25,000 in total--are one inch in diameter, and connect homes to the larger, main pipes running under the middles of streets. the project of replacing all lead pipes will need a city-wide lead pipe map. the water pipes are buried at a depth of 3.5 feet to put them below the frost line, and will need to be extracted. the michigan's state report produced in september 2015 on replacing all lead pipes in the city of flint places the per-household cost at between $2-8,000. the report estimates that it would take fifteen year to completely replace lead pipes at an estimated cost of $ 60 million. flint mayor karen weaver announced that her goal would be to replace 13,000 lead pipes at a cost of $2-3,000 for each pipe for a total of about $42 million. no one knows the reality of undertaking a massive effort such as what will be needed, so the cost could easily be much higher than estimates. flint cannot be another katrina where the poor, people of color and marginalized are shutout of jobs as well as the political and decision making processes regarding their homes, neighborhoods or city. replacing the lead pipes of flint, must include the cost of repairing homes that will be [[page h7497]] damaged to access the pipes; repaving driveways, or re-sodding lawns that are dug up to get to pipes, and restoring sidewalks that are damaged to access pipe. these costs can easily put another $40-50 million in addition cost to lead pipe replacement. further, the current and long term health effects on residents must be addressed. these massive costs that flint will incur cannot be placed on the shoulders of michigan alone. we will continue to work to help the people of flint, michigan in order to restore them to health and bring them out of this crisis. the speaker pro tempore. all time for debate has expired. pursuant to house resolution 949, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. the question is on the third reading of the bill. the bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the third time. {time} 1215 motion to recommit mr. michael f. doyle of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i have a motion to recommit at the desk. the speaker pro tempore. is the gentleman opposed to the bill? mr. michael f. doyle of pennsylvania. i am opposed to it in its current form. the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will report the motion to recommit. the clerk read as follows: mr. michael f. doyle of pennsylvania moves to recommit the bill s. 612 to the committee on energy and commerce with instructions to report the same back to the house forthwith, with the following amendment: in section 2113, in the matter proposed to be inserted into section 1452(a) of the safe drinking water act as paragraph (4)(a), strike ``during fiscal year 2017, funds'' and insert ''funds''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. mr. michael f. doyle of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. if adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of this motion to recommit in order to significantly improve this bill by restoring the bipartisan buy american language that was inextricably stripped over the last 3 days. the wiin act provides important funding for ports, harbors, and waterways around the country. i think infrastructure issues like this bill should be something we can all agree on. in fact, they have been historically bipartisan. then again, i also think that support for hardworking americans should also be bipartisan. i was disappointed that my bipartisan amendment, offered by myself and my good friend from north carolina, representative walter jones, was rejected yesterday at the rules committee by a party-line vote. our amendment would have made the buy american provisions for epa's drinking water state revolving fund permanent, matching all other clean water programs and all other federal infrastructure programs. i want to reemphasize that. every other program, federal infrastructure programs, clean water programs, have permanent buy american provisions. so the question is: why does this bill just have a 1-year provision? if you do not think that sends a signal to china that 1 year from today they can start dumping steel over in the united states and undercutting our steel industry and our steelworkers, then you are not living on the same planet that i am. the senate passed their bill, including language making the buy american requirement for the drinking water state revolving fund permanent, with an overwhelming bipartisan vote, 95-3. house republican leadership, for some unexplained reason, replaced this bipartisan senate language with a 1-year extension at the last minute. i do not understand why we would do this, why we would undercut the american steel industry; but i believe that their actions send a clear message to those folks in the steel mills around our country that we do not have their back. these hardworking americans depend on manufacturing jobs to support their families, and they have suffered because of chinese steel dumped in our markets. u.s. steel mills have closed. american steelworkers have lost their jobs, and others have had their hours cut. this is personal to me. my father supported our family working in a steel mill, just like his father before him. they supported their families through these tough, dangerous jobs, like millions around the country. there is dignity in that work, and we need to make sure that congress does not kill that dignity, along with the kind of jobs americans can support a family on. u.s. tax dollars should support american manufacturers and help preserve hardworking families across this nation. i think these workers and their families deserve more certainty and more support. president-elect trump said just last week: ``we have two simple rules when it comes to this massive rebuilding effort: buy american and hire american.'' now, the president-elect and i may be from different parties, but we certainly agree on that. i have had members from both sides of the aisle come up to me and say that they support our amendment, and that they would vote for it on the floor. members on both sides of the aisle at rules spoke in favor of this amendment. well, we did not get the vote we wanted out of the rules committee, but, colleagues, this is our chance to send a message and tell the american workers and american manufacturers that we have got their back by passing this motion to recommit. it just does one simple thing. it changes this 1-year provision to permanent, just like the senate bill that got sent down here and every other infrastructure bill that we do in this country. colleagues, let us not send the signal to china that america is open for them to dump their steel and put our companies and our workers out of jobs. let us tell american companies and american workers that this congress has their back. vote for this motion to recommit and let us stick up for the american worker and our american manufacturers. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i thank my good friend from western pennsylvania. i support buy american provisions, and, of course, as he mentioned, there is a 1-year provision in this. i just disagree--this is not the process for doing this moving forward. i believe it will kill the bill. this is a good bill. it was carefully negotiated with our counterparts in the senate and both sides of the aisle. it represents a lot of--months and months of hard work. first, the bill will create jobs. it keeps american jobs in america by strengthening or competitiveness and grows our economy, and it will be including american steel in it. second, it is a fiscally responsible bill. we fully offset it. it reduces a deficit by a half a billion dollars. finally, it reasserts congressional authority by restoring the 2-year cycle of considering wrda bills. it returns us to regular order, preventing unelected bureaucrats from making decisions on our nation's water infrastructure. so stopping the bill now, i do not think, is the right thing to do. let us pass it. let us continue to work together to get strong, buy american provisions as we move forward, which is something i do support. so i urge a ``no'' vote at this time. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. there was no objection. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion to recommit. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. mr. michael f. doyle of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. [[page h7498]] the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx and the order of the house today, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________
