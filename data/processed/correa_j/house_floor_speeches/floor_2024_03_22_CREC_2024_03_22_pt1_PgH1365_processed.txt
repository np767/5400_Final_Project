[[page h1480]] we made targeted cuts to wasteful programs and developed a package that is proof of that. we looked at each need, and it was clear that the world is becoming a more dangerous place. we made changes and decided on efforts that include countering china, developing next-generation weapons, and investing in the quality of life of our servicemembers. i am proud to say that this bill strengthens our national security and funds critical defense efforts. this package also includes other key priorities. it continues our strong support of israel, combats the flow of illegal drugs, and fully funds medical research for cancer and chronic diseases. against all odds, house republicans refocused spending on america's most crucial needs at home and abroad. i urge my colleagues to support this bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. roy. madam speaker, here we are again. the swamp is back in full force. we have a 1,000-page bill of $1.2 trillion filled with all manner of spending priorities that are at odds with the american people. that is what we have in front of us. this bill is over 1,000 pages long. it contains hundreds of pages of report language, 1,400 earmarks, and we have had about 24 hours to review it. that is not the way to do business. the american people and american families are the ones left holding the bag. this is business as usual in the swamp. here is the deal to my republican colleagues: you will own every single bit of this. if you vote for this bill, you own it. dhs funding contingent on signing h.r. 2 into law, that is what we did last year to make sure our border will be secure. that is punted, so you own it. defunding alejandro mayorkas. we did that in our bill. this punts that. it is no longer there. you own it. prohibiting mass parole and release of illegal aliens via the cbp one app. we did that in our bill last year. this bill gets rid of it. you own it. you own the continued mass parole of illegal aliens into our country. you own that. that is the truth. it was mass parole that led to a venezuelan gang member coming into the united states and killing laken riley. my republican colleagues cannot go campaign against mass parole and use the name of laken riley because you pass a bill in her name when you fund the very policies that led to her death. {time} 1015 i hear all this, that we are going to increase ice beds, and we are going to increase the numbers for border patrol. the increased numbers for border patrol will process more illegal aliens. the increased number of beds for ice will not be used because there are memos in place by alejandro mayorkas, whom we impeached and whom this bill will fund. those ice beds will not be filled. they will not be used, and we know it. we set out to prohibit dhs from fast-tracking asylum. this bill does not do that. we set out to make sure that this border would be secure and that you could end what happened yesterday in texas where 100 illegal aliens bum-rushed our border, rolled over the texas national guard, fled into this country, and went to border patrol to get released into the united states. that is what this bill continues to fund. any of my republican colleagues who want to spend this year campaigning against open borders, it is a laugh because today, if you vote for this abomination of a bill, you will be voting to fund it. you will be voting to fund the very policies that you will campaign against. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. general leave ms. granger. madam speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from texas? there was no objection. ms. granger. madam speaker, i ask unanimous consent to yield 10 minutes of my time to the gentlewoman from connecticut (ms. delauro), and that she be allowed to control the time. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from texas? there was no objection. ms. delauro. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, i am delighted and relieved to be finally closing out fiscal year 2024, and for that, i thank chairwoman kay granger, chair patty murray, and vice chair susan collins. i am proud to have made history with such experienced appropriators. madam speaker, 2024 marks the first time negotiations on government funding have been led on all four corners by women. i have many others to thank--subcommittee ranking members and chairs and staff on both sides of the aisle--and i will be submitting these names for the record. i strongly support the bipartisan bill, which funds the majority of the united states government. this bill sides with the hardworking majority of americans. it helps to lower the cost of living, protects women's rights and access to reproductive healthcare, reinforces america's global leadership, and helps our communities be safe and secure. i am pleased that democrats and republicans again united to make government work for the people of this country. like the funding bill we passed earlier this month, this legislation does not have everything either side may have wanted, but i am satisfied that many of the extreme cuts and the policies proposed by house republicans were rejected. i am enormously proud that we are providing an increase of $1 billion for childcare and head start, expanding access to quality and affordable childcare for hardworking families. we increased title i education funding, protecting 224,000 teachers' jobs that house republicans tried to eliminate. i am also pleased that we successfully defeated every one of the republicans' extreme policy riders in the labor-hhs bill. in this package, we prioritize the men and women in our armed services and their families by securing pay and allowance increases of over 5 percent, the highest increase in decades. we invest in global health and support 12,000 special immigrant visas for afghans who assisted the united states. critically, we strengthened our border security. i urge swift passage of this package, and i look forward to moving on to how we can best serve the american people in fiscal year 2025. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. roy. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (mrs. luna). mrs. luna. madam speaker, i rise in opposition to speak against the current omnibus that we are seeing hitting the floor today. this administration and many people on both sides talk about how they want to champion black and brown people in this country, and that is a direct quote from a recent press release from the biden administration. the fact is that this omnibus, this government being open and allowing for open borders, is doing nothing but actually hurting those communities. what we are seeing right now at the border is a rise in crime. we are seeing these very communities being impacted by the rise in gang violence. frankly, it has been disgusting to watch crony capitalists push the importation of cheap labor. i do not know if anyone has recently witnessed what happened with tyson farms, but they actually fired americans to hire immigrant workers, a.k.a. illegals. after september 25, 2023, they were probed by the federal government over the employment of migrant children, who likely washed the bloody floors and razor-sharp machines. why would anyone want to continue to fund a government that, a, is complicit in this, but, b, is also responsible for losing 85,000 migrant children? the fact is that we cannot continue down this path. it is hurting all people. i think if you want to claim to protect minorities, then you need to ensure [[page h1481]] that you are putting americans first and not simply just using that as a way to get elected while stabbing americans in the back and hurting our communities. ms. granger. madam speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. calvert), the chairman of the subcommittee on defense. mr. calvert. madam speaker, i rise today in strong support of the negotiated appropriations package. today is zero hour. we are out of time. today's vote may be the most consequential of your lifetime. right now, our troops around the world are facing multiple threats. our supremacy on land, sea, air, and space is being challenged, and our allies are under attack. i could go through a long list of vital programs and funding included in this bill--the wins for our troops, the historic funding for innovation and counter-drug activities, and the focus on countering china. time is short, and the stakes have never been higher. for the members who are considering voting against the bill due to objections in other titles and are under the impression that if this bill fails, we will have another chance to vote for a full-year defense bill, i want to be very clear: this is it. every member must understand the impact of not passing this package. the only other option will be a full-year continuing resolution, which will devastate our national security and put our country at risk. a cr will cut defense spending by $27 billion and trigger additional cuts from sequestration. this is something that has not happened in the history of this country and will cut our military off at the knees in the midst of the most dangerous period we have seen since world war ii. a cr maintains policies negotiated by the last congress, eliminates all member priorities from the bill, and gives the biden administration the freedom to shift appropriations as they see fit. simply put, we will cede all congressional authority and oversight on spending to the biden administration. a cr would be an abdication of our responsibility to our military and to this body. a ``no'' vote is a vote for china, russia, iran, north korea, and hamas. vote ``yes'' for our men and women in uniform, for all americans, and for our country. ms. delauro. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new york (mr. jeffries), the distinguished democratic leader. mr. jeffries. madam speaker, i thank the distinguished gentlewoman from the great state of connecticut for yielding, the honorable rosa delauro. i thank her for her extraordinary leadership throughout this process and getting us to this principled result. i thank all the appropriators for their extraordinary work, on the democratic side and on the republican side, as part of the effort to complete the fiscal year 2024 appropriations. this has not been a perfect process, but we should never let the perfect be the enemy of the good when it comes to solving problems on behalf of hardworking american taxpayers. this is a good result for the american people in terms of standing up for their health, their safety, their education, their national security protection, and, of course, above all else, their economic well-being, a bipartisan process leading to a bipartisan result that will hopefully lay a foundation for us to continue to do the work of the american people together. we have said from the very beginning of this congress that, as democrats, we will find bipartisan common ground with our republican colleagues on any issue, whenever and wherever possible, as long as it will make life better for the american people. that is exactly what house democrats continue to do. at the same time, we have said we will push back against extremism whenever necessary. we will always defend a woman's freedom to make her own reproductive healthcare decisions. we will always defend the gorgeous mosaic of the american people and push back against unnecessary attacks against diversity, equity, and inclusion. these are american values. we will always fight to protect and strengthen social security and medicare. we will always put people over politics. we hope that that will continue, not just on the democratic side but together to solve problems for the american people. as soon as we complete this work, let us turn to our national security priorities and make sure that we do not abandon the people of ukraine in their hour of greatest need as they fight for principles like democracy, freedom, and truth, and push back against autocracy, tyranny, and propaganda. america should always stand on the side of principles like democracy, freedom, and truth, and that means standing with the people of ukraine. i thank, once again, the appropriators for their leadership in concluding this process. i urge everybody to support this legislation. i hope that as we move forward in our promise to you and, more importantly, to the american people, who expect that in this congress we should have more common sense and less chaos, more decency and less dysfunction, and more exceptionalism and less extremism, our promise to you is that we will do our best to put people over politics. we hope that you will do the same. vote ``yes'' on this bill. mr. roy. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. madam speaker, the democratic leader talks about the mosaic. i assume by the mosaic, which anyone who votes for this bill today will be supporting, we are talking about $156,000 for the hartford gay and lesbian health collective, an organization self-described as champions of lgbtqia equity and provides training in cultural competency and access to healthcare for lgbtq youth, or $2 million to an oregon clinic that provides hormone therapy for kids, or the $850,000 for gay senior housing in massachusetts, or $400,000 for briarpatch youth services in wisconsin that has gender-affirming clothing program for kids 13 to 18, or $400,000 to the garden state equality education fund, which helps minors transition genders, promotes biological boys playing girls' sports and using the same restrooms. i could go on and on. how about the million dollars for the inner- city muslim network, which calls for the destruction of israel? that is what we are funding. that is precisely what we are funding in this legislation. when the democratic leader talks about a mosaic, that is what he is talking about. my republican colleagues, who will campaign against it all year--they will--they are voting to fund it today. to be very clear, my republican colleagues are voting to fund that so-called mosaic today unless they choose the right path and vote against it. my friend from california, when he talked about the horrors that will happen if we have a cr, well, we should not be here. this is the swamp acting like it does: have government funding expire on the friday before a 2-week recess heading into easter precisely to have the pressure of jet fumes so that the american people are the ones left holding the bag so that we, members of congress, can go off to our codels, can go travel, can go do your fundraisers, can make sure you get home. the ones left holding the bag are the american people. when we talk about this, the game was given up when we talk about defense. everything that is happening here is being done in the name of defense, everything that you see, and talking about our national security being undermined. {time} 1030 well, tell me about national security in texas when you have the national guard getting rolled over in el paso, when you have texans dying from fentanyl poisoning, when you have gangs and cartels operating in texas. talk to me about national security then. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from arizona (mr. biggs). mr. biggs. madam speaker, the gentlewoman from connecticut (ms. delauro) said that in this bill they were able to successfully reject republicans' request for spending reductions and rejected republicans' request for riders. yet, somehow, the republicans [[page h1482]] are going to vote for that. that is outrageous. she is right, though. she got the spending. she killed the riders. when i hear that a vote against this is a vote for china, what we really are saying is a vote for this is a vote for chinese terrorism because we have had over 30,000 illegal aliens from china come across the border with this border policy. what you are going to get is you are voting actually to speed up the process of redistribution of illegal aliens that come in because that is what the funding is going to go for. you are talking about beds? those beds are going to go empty. why? because you are going to ship these people out as soon as they get here. that is what is happening within 24 hours. so the crimes, the fentanyl death, the terrorist initiatives that are coming our way, you vote for this, you are funding it, you own it. ms. granger. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from florida (mr. diaz-balart), the chairman of the state, foreign operations, and related programs subcommittee. mr. diaz-balart. madam speaker, i thank the chairwoman for yielding and also the speaker for bringing us to this point. let me tell you, i am proud of the state, foreign operations, and related programs portion of the bill that we are dealing with today. let us take out a little bit of the noise and the rhetoric and let us talk about what is in the bill. it includes a 6 percent reduction from fiscal year 2023. let us be clear, we are at a critical point in our history. one of our most important allies is in its time of greatest need, and this bill answers the call. it is the strongest pro-israel state-foreign operations bill that we have ever seen. so let us talk about facts. it provides $3.3 billion in fmf, foreign military financing, for israel. almost as important as what is funded, is what is not funded in this bill. the bill prohibits funds to unrwa, which has become, frankly, a de facto subsidiary of hamas. the passage of this bill means not one additional dollar from american taxpayers will fund this deeply flawed organization. but if we go to a cr, we are going to continue to fund it. the passage of this bill also prohibits funds for the anti-semitic un commission of inquiry against israel. the passage of this bill means no funds can be used to delist the iranian revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization or to implement that infamous nuclear agreement with iran. another top priority, madam speaker, is countering communist china. this bill includes $300 million foreign military financing for taiwan-- the first time ever in an appropriations bill that we have done that. the passage of this bill prohibits the use of foreign aid to repay chinese debt. also another priority to strengthening our national security is supporting democracy around the world and defending human rights and human dignity. this bill increases funding to promote democracy and human rights in cuba and establishes strict guidelines to ensure that this crucial funding supports the democratic opposition. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. ms. granger. madam speaker, i yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from florida. mr. diaz-balart. so it helps the democratic opposition and not the terrorist regime's chosen businesses. we also stand strongly against human trafficking and particularly human trafficking of doctors. this bill also supports those struggling for freedom in our hemisphere's most repressive, anti-american dictatorships in venezuela and nicaragua. if we fail to pass this bill, we lose provisions on the prohibition of funds for encouraging, organizing, facilitating, or promoting migrant caravans to the united states border. if this bill fails, then those funding sources to again, organizations that are promoting caravans of illegal folks to the united states will continue. that is factual. that is in this bill. if this legislation were not to pass, we lose the protection of free speech by limiting how funds can be used under the pretext of countering disinformation. if this legislation were not to pass, we would go back to current law. we would lose the restriction that only the u.s. flag may be flown or displayed over a facility of the state department. madam speaker, this bill reduces spending. it reprioritizes funding towards our vital national security interests and carries crucial limitations and smart policy changes to rein in the biden administration. if this bill were to fail, we are giving carte blanche to the biden bureaucracy. it is a dramatic improvement, madam speaker, from current law. before i close, let me thank the staff for their hard work, and again, madam speaker, this is an important bill at a crucial, critical time when american leadership is sorely needed. we are not getting it from the white house. this bill goes a long way to reestablish american leadership. ms. delauro. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from maryland (mr. hoyer), the distinguished ranking member of the financial services and general government subcommittee. mr. hoyer. madam speaker, 1 minute is too little time. the financial services bill is a good bill. it is the responsible alternative. it is ironic that the group that has made compromise the most difficult over the last year continues to oppose compromise. legislative action is about compromise. this is a responsible compromise. as so many of the chairs of the subcommittees on the republican side have said, the alternative is the least responsible action that we could take. i urge my colleagues to vote for this bill as the responsible, effective alternative, notwithstanding the fact that the operations up to this point of the appropriations committee have not been what they ought to be, and we all understand that. it is our collective failure caused, as i said, by a group who does not want compromise. pass this bill. america needs this bill. it is a shame it is not going to be followed by passing aid for ukraine. mr. roy. madam speaker, the distinguished former majority leader brings up fsgg, the financial services and general government bill. what he left out was the fact that we are going to give $200 million to the fbi for its new headquarters, even after republicans touted in the last massive omnibus bill that we are cutting the fbi and then relied upon getting rid of an earmark in alabama to claim that it was a bigger cut than it really is. now what is happening to the american people, guess what? the fbi is getting a brand-new, shiny headquarters, despite running roughshod over the american people, spying on them. by the way, we extended fisa to continue spying on the american people. we also failed to prohibit the treasury from establishing a central bank digital currency. house republicans passed that. in this deal that was cut we do not do that. why? why? why would it be so abhorrent to ban a central bank digital currency? madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from south carolina (mr. norman), my friend. mr. norman. madam speaker, i woke up this morning to a text from an elderly lady saying that we are under attack, can congress do anything to protect our borders? the blood of further deaths of americans is on your hands. i disagree with my good friends on the right side. this is anything but a national security bill. look at what is happening at the border. look at what is happening to the agents that got bum-rushed in el paso last night. now, anybody that votes for this bill, you are saying--and for all the listeners, are you agreeing to $500 million for jordan, including $150 million for border security in jordan? are you agreeing, and do you like $125 million to help egyptians attend college in egypt? is this where you want your money? do you want $286 million for title x family planning, which is an abortion clinic? folks, the list goes on and on. this is insanity. here is the fix: i call on our speaker--he is the only one that can do it-- [[page h1483]] to vote this bill down. take that mace down--which has to be in place; it has been in place for 182 years to have a session in the house of representatives--cut the lights off, and until the senate accepts a total shutdown of the border, until they accept a total h.r. 2, we do not come back. why fund a government that is working against us? it is total insanity. ms. granger. madam speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. joyce), the chairman of the homeland security subcommittee. mr. joyce of ohio. madam speaker, i rise today in support of the package of appropriations bills under consideration. as chairman of the homeland security subcommittee, i thank the full committee chair, ms. granger, for her leadership in assembling funding packages that reflect strong republican priorities. the crisis at our southwest border has raged under the biden administration. more than 2 million migrants crossed the border each of the last 2 years. that is not sustainable. so this bill makes key investments to secure the border, expand detention, improve technology, and deter illegal immigration. under this bill, we provide $500 million to reach an end strength of 22,000 border agents consistent with h.r. 2. to counter fentanyl, this bill provides $305 million for nonintrusive inspection equipment at our nation's ports of entry. this bill ensures ice has the detention capacity it needs to enforce the law by providing 41,500 detention beds. without this funding, ice would have released more than 10,000 current detainees who pose a threat to our communities. this bill also provides the coast guard with two fast response cutters to counter chinese aggression in the pacific. additionally, this bill fully funds the coast guard's military pay raise, keeping our promise of supporting our troops. simply put, this bill ensures that men and women of the department of homeland security who work tirelessly on our behalf have the resources and tools they need to protect this great nation. it reflects strong republican priorities, cuts wasteful spending, and prioritizes securing the border. we cannot surrender this progress for a wasteful and harmful government shutdown. i ask my colleagues to support this bill. ms. delauro. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from minnesota (ms. mccollum), the distinguished ranking member of the defense subcommittee. ms. mccollum. madam speaker, well, it is no secret that this appropriations cycle was tough, and as ranking member of the defense appropriations subcommittee, i thank--really thank--chairman calvert for working in a bipartisan manner to get the defense bill done. this compromise defense bill is focused on two things--national security and our servicemembers and their families. this bill provides our servicemembers with the training and the equipment necessary to complete their missions and come home as soon and safely as possible. it supports military families with a 5.2 percent pay increase. it includes a 5.4 percent increase to the basic housing allowance. this bill restores at least some funding for ukraine through the ukraine security assistance initiative. but the house must pass the senate's security supplemental as soon as possible. i am glad to report that all the partisan riders that were originally in the defense house bill have been removed. madam speaker, this minibus shows us that there is only one way to fund the government, and that is on a bipartisan basis--full stop. let us follow this example in the next appropriations cycle. i urge members to support the bill. {time} 1045 mr. roy. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. clyde). mr. clyde. madam speaker, i say to my house and senate republican colleagues, it is time to put their vote where their values are. madam speaker, you cannot claim to be a pro-life champion and then fund abortion, abortion travel, and aborted fetal tissue research. you cannot rail against president biden's intentional illegal invasion and then fund the policies that are causing the chaos without assuming the same responsibility. just like you cannot flaunt your vote to impeach secretary mayorkas and then fully fund his salary and his destructive border policies. madam speaker, you cannot defend america's second amendment liberties and then fund gun control by the cdc. you cannot support science and protect young women and then fund transgender surgeries and fund educational institutions that allow biological males to compete in women's sports. i do not call them men because they are not real men. real men protect women. they do not use their superior strength to steal the honor, hard work, and achievements of women. madam speaker, you cannot complain about the violation of america's first amendment rights and then fund more disinformation governance boards and government by proxy censorship. you cannot sound the alarm on our dire economic outlook and ballooning national debt and then rubberstamp spending higher than nancy pelosi's levels for fy 2023. the list goes on and on. republicans simply cannot righteously denounce democrats' disastrous policies that are destroying our great country and then turn around and fund them. after all, if you fund it, you own it. it is not too late. we promised the american people that we would fix these problems, not fund them. i urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the swamp's second half omnibus. ms. delauro. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar), the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on homeland security. mr. cuellar. madam speaker, as the ranking member, i live at the border. i do not just go visit the border. i know the border. this is a strong border security bill that we passed in a bipartisan, commonsense way. this bill takes away all the poisonous riders and adds bipartisan riders. it adds the largest number of border patrol agents, 22,000 agents. it adds cbp officers at the bridges so they can stop fentanyl. it adds support staff so they can support the agents. it adds money to air marines so they can do their work and counter drones. it adds money for the tsa so they can have pay equity. it adds money to the food and shelter program, which is important for the border community. it adds beds that are being used right now, even up to 41,700 beds. it adds money for deportation when aliens do not have their rights after they get processed. it fully funds reunification efforts for families that were unjustly separated. it adds money for the border patrol. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. ms. delauro. madam speaker, i yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from texas. mr. cuellar. madam speaker, it adds money to stonegarden so local law enforcement can do their work. i would say, madam speaker, this is the strongest border security bill that we have. it is fair. i ask folks to support this bill. again, i live at the border. i do not go visit. this is a strong homeland security bill. mr. roy. madam speaker, i thank my friend from texas for his remarks, but i would simply disagree. all we are doing here is adding beds that are not going to be used. all we are doing is adding money for a border patrol that will not be allowed to do their job. they will be processing more people and releasing them against the law under parole policies that are damaging the country and that led to laken riley's death. that is literally all this does. madam speaker, i yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentlewoman from georgia (ms. greene). ms. greene of georgia. madam speaker, i rise in extreme opposition to the second part of the omnibus bill. no republican in the house of representatives in good conscience can vote for this bill. it is a complete departure of all of our principles, especially if you call yourself pro-life. this [[page h1484]] bill funds full-term abortion. this is not a republican bill. this is a chuck schumer, democrat-controlled bill coming from the house majority that is supposed to be controlled by republicans, yet our majority has been turned over to the democrats. the speaker pro tempore. members are reminded to direct their remarks to the chair. ms. greene of georgia. madam speaker, it is the will of our voters, and it is the will of republicans across the country that this bill should not be brought to the floor. this bill will absolutely destroy our majority and will tell every single one of our voters that this majority is a failure. this is the bill that the white house cannot wait to sign into law. this is the bill that rips our border wide open and tells every single person in over 160 countries around the world they can invade our country, they can run over our border patrol, they can run over our texas national guard, they can come in, rape our women, murder our people, and squat and take over our homes. madam speaker, this is an atrocious attack on the american people. the speaker of the house should not bring it to the floor, and this bill should not pass. mr. roy. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from missouri (mr. burlison). mr. burlison. madam speaker, i think that this bill defies any kind of objective understanding of the reality of the situation that we are in. we are at $34 trillion in debt. it is the highest debt-to-gdp that we have experienced in the history of the united states of america, higher than we experienced after world war ii, and we just left a war. today, we are at that same level of debt-to-gdp, and yet we are facing potential wars. this situation is the greatest threat to national security that there is. to add more debt onto this nation is only risking us even further. our border is a threat to national security, and yet we are doing very little to actually fix it in this bill. no matter how much we talk about some of the things that are in the bill, at the end of the day, i hear expressions like this, as the swamp people say: somebody has got to govern. within that statement, therein lies the false pretense that government is the solution to our problems. government is the problem. mr. roy. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. perry). mr. perry. madam speaker, last night, when i was looking over the bill, i got a text with a film in it, a video clip of soldiers in uniform being overrun at el paso, being overrun by illegal foreign nationals coming into our country, just running right over them. i do not know what their orders were. i do not know what their rules of engagement were. i do not know how anybody expected them to stop these people coming into our country wholesale. what was amazing and astounding as well, madam speaker, is those folks all ran to the border patrol to come into our country illegally. border patrol was ordered by president biden and secretary mayorkas to allow these people to come into our country. my friends on the other side of the aisle are going to say we got more beds and we got more border patrol agents. those agents are going to process these individuals into our country, and those beds are going to go unfilled because these people are coming to your town. madam speaker, this bill makes americans pay for their own sellout, and i recommend that we all vote ``no.'' mr. roy. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from kentucky (mr. massie). mr. massie. madam speaker, today we are setting a dangerous precedent. we are suspending the 3-day rule so that our constituents do not have time to see what is in this bill. we know a few things that are in it. we know it spends too much money. we know it has got money to groom our children, down to ages of 12, into being trans. we know it has got funding for facilities to do late-term abortions. why would republicans vote for that? it has got a dangerous cocktail that the swamp has always served, and we are drunk on it today. what is that cocktail? earmarks and budget gimmicks with a chaser of the fumes from dca, the smell of jet fuel at dca. what are we going to do? as soon as we betray americans by passing this bill, we are all going to the airport and going on recess for 2 weeks. this is not the way we should do the nation's business. we need to preserve the 3-day rule. we need to follow our own rules. we need to bring these bills through committee and do regular order. madam speaker, i urge people to vote against this bill. mr. roy. madam speaker, may i inquire as to the time remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from texas has 3\1/4\ minutes remaining. mr. roy. madam speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from arizona (mr. crane). mr. crane. madam speaker, i am going to be voting ``no'' for this bill. madam speaker, first, for my republican colleagues, it is important that we understand that the american people do not expect us to win every time, but they sure as hell expect us to fight. that is not what we are doing. we should not be fighting for this. this is garbage. the next thing i want to address real quick is for the american people. the american people should pay attention to who votes for this. when they come back to their hometown in their district and talk at the next lincoln day dinner about fiscal responsibility and securing the border, if they voted for this, let them hear about it. mr. roy. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. the gentleman from florida a moment ago talked about the fact that we defund unrwa, and we defund some policies that are pernicious. i agree with him. it is a part of the process that we carried out last year when we set out to change this institution, to return to some sort of regular order, to have 72 hours to read bills, to be able to have single-subject bills, to offer amendments on the floor, to actually have an appropriations process. we passed seven appropriations bills off the floor of the house. we passed three out of committee to the floor. we actually had some amount of debate and were able to move things through. we got some of our policy priorities. we sent them over to the senate. then what did we do? we walked away and went back to business as usual in the swamp where a handful of people that they call the four corners all sit back and decide for you, not the people in this room as a body, but a handful of so-called cardinals, the same group that i heard guffawing in the back a minute ago, the same bloc of appropriators that think they are the ones that get to control the entire world and use our men and women in uniform as an excuse to undermine the national security of this country by spending money we do not have, by racking up debt to the tune of a trillion dollars every 100 days, while funding all manner of sin with respect to transgender surgeries, abortion tourism, funding the world health organization to give away our sovereignty, funding open borders with mass parole that led to the death of laken riley. madam speaker, everybody who votes for this bill today owns it. they cannot go out and campaign this year saying they opposed this stuff when they wrote the check. that is what is happening today. every single republican and every single democrat who votes for this omnibus spending bill today owns it. they own the open borders. they own the woke military that we cannot recruit people to fight in. they own giving our sovereignty to the world health organization and international bodies. they own more funding for the wuhan lab. yeah, that is all in there. they own it. {time} 1100 they own it. we should vote ``no.'' mr. speaker, do you want to win in november? then vote ``no.'' mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. granger. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, 11,388 members have served historically in the united states house of representatives. [[page h1485]] we are blessed, and what we are charged with is serving the american people. that is our job. it is not serving our individual philosophies, ideologies, or whatever it is that we believe. we need to govern on behalf of the american people. i am proud to have been working with democrats and republicans united to make government work for the people of this country. it is a bipartisan bill, it sides with the hardworking majority of americans, it helps to lower their cost of living, it protects women's rights, it reinforces america's global leadership, and, yes, it helps our communities be safe and secure. what we do is not about those of us who serve in this chamber. it is about what we do on behalf of the people of this country outside of this chamber. this bill serves the american people, and it has democrat and republican support to move forward. we are 6 months into this 2024 year. we have been unable to do the work of the people because some people will hold us back. again, it is our job. the reason why we are elected is to serve the american people. that is what we are charged with. let us never forget that we are blessed to serve here. we have a duty to perform and to do what is right. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this bill. it makes sense for us to do it, and we do it because we represent hardworking families in this country who put their faith and trust in us to do this job on their behalf. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. granger. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i want to give my thanks and appreciation to my democratic colleagues on the committee, especially subcommittee ranking members sanford bishop, matt cartwright, betty mccollum, marcy kaptur, steny hoyer, henry cuellar, chellie pingree, adriano espaillat, debbie wassermann schultz, barbara lee, and mike quigley, for fighting hard for the american people and for democratic priorities in each of your bills. in the majority, my thanks and congratulations to subcommittee chairs andy harris, harold rogers, ken calvert, chuck fleischmann, steve womack, david joyce, mike simpson, robert aderholt, mark amodei, john carter, mario diaz-balart, and tom cole. i thank you all for engaging in these hard-fought negotiations with respect and patriotism. my deep appreciation goes to the majority and minority staff, especially minority staff director chris bigelow, minority clerks martha foley, bob bonner, jennifer chartrand, scott mckee, matt smith, bob joachim, rita culp, stephen steigleider, faye cobb, jenny neuscheler, erin kolodjeski, and christina monroe. i also want to thank my front office staff, jason gray, raquel spencer, adam wilson, ryann kinney, alex swann, tom tucker, as well as my communications staff katelynn thorpe and ben cowlishaw. this would not be possible without the hard work of tyler coe, nora faye, jocelyn hunn, jackie kilroy, shannon mccully, laurie mignone, farouk ophaso, stephanie reed, philip tizzani, and thomas wilson. their hard work, long hours, and dedication behind the scenes is what makes this possible. and i also owe a great deal of gratitude to my personal office staff, including becky salay, jack rayburn, king green, caitlin peruccio, daniel robillard, harper white, john myron, sam erickson, diana solares, mia villiavicencio-eschinger, and clay vaughan. everyone i have just named keeps my name on the door. i thank them all. ms. lee of california, as ranking member of the house state and foreign operations subcommittee, i am sorely disappointed with this outcome. i have spent much of my time in congress talking about the 3ds of our national security--diplomacy, development and defense. each of these has a role to play in keeping our country safe and secure, and creating a world where kids and grandkids can prosper. the sfops bill is supposed to fund two of those ds--diplomacy and development. but this package slashes diplomacy and development by 6 percent than 15 percent below what the president identified as the global need. meanwhile, the pentagon gets a $27 billion increase--despite failing audits. america needs the diplomatic and development tools in the sfops bill to prevent wars. i fear this package leaves america weaker and more vulnerable. this funding imbalance undermines both our values and our interests. i hope we can work together to get our priorities rebalanced. mr. soto. mr. speaker, i thank the authors of h. res. 1102--further consolidated appropriations act, 2024 for funding department of defense programs that support secure domestic semiconductor advanced packaging manufacturing technology and capabilities. i also thank the staff who contributed to this effort. specifically, i express gratitude to my colleagues for the following actions: fully funding the industrial base analysis and sustainment support's (ibas) reshore ecosystem for secure heterogeneous advanced packaging electronics (reshape) program within the research, development, test and evaluation, defense-wide account; providing $10.25 million in additional funding for ibas's 2.5d advanced packaging program within the research, development, test and evaluation, defense-wide account; and providing $2 million in additional funding for aerospace sensors' zero-trust environment for semiconductor technology within the research, development, test and evaluation, air force account. microelectronics support nearly all dod activities. they enable critical capabilities such as the global positioning system, radar, command and control, and communication. ensuring secure access to leading-edge microelectronics is a challenge, however. the pandemic highlighted challenges associated with the global supply chain, the changing global semiconductor industry, and the sophistication of u.s. adversaries who threaten to target military electronic components. funding for the three projects highlighted above help address these challenges. ibas is dedicated to ensuring that the dod is positioned to effectively address industrial base issues and support the national security innovation base. ibas achieves this mission by strengthening and protecting the domestic semiconductor supply chain to provide access to leading-edge capabilities that accelerate innovation. one of the next generation semiconductor technologies that ibas focuses on is heterogeneous integration and advanced packing. these technologies provide secure, credible, and reliable domestic advanced microelectronics manufacturing capability. full funding for the reshape program, along with $10.25 in additional funding for ibas's 2.5d advanced packaging program will support machine tooling and advanced packaging manufacturing capabilities and allow ibas to support next generation domestic production lines. the $2 million in additional funding provided for aerospace sensors' zero-trust environment for semiconductor technology further helps address critical challenges associated with domestic semiconductor manufacturing. the air force research lab (afrl) is working on a new modeling and simulation research program (secure digital twin) to advance next generation semiconductor design and manufacturing. funding for the zero-trust environment for semiconductor technology will provide capabilities that deliver solutions that protect against malicious function insertion, fraudulent products, theft of intellectual property, and reliability failures within dod semiconductors. i believe congress should continue to provide resources necessary to update our domestic microelectronics security framework. i am proud of the work undertaken in my district to support domestic semiconductor manufacturing technology development and to ensure the security of this critical supply chain. i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to support this goal. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as a senior member of the committees on the budget, judiciary, and homeland security, i proudly rise in support of h. res. 1102--further consolidated appropriations act, 2024 (approps minibus no. 2) which will provide funding to continue the operations of the federal government through september 30, 2024, enhance supportive services to the american people, and avoid a wasteful and irresponsible shutdown. after multiple continuing resolutions and threats of a government shutdown, i am relieved that an agreement has been reached between the bicameral, bipartisan leadership, and produced a second minibus spending package that keeps our remaining federal agencies funded. this bipartisan legislation, which represents a compromise between republicans and democrats that adheres to the fiscal responsibility act, would fund the remainder of the federal government through the end of the fiscal year, while investing in key priorities for the american people. specifically, the further consolidated appropriations act of 2024, provides full-year funding for the six remaining fy24 appropriations bills: defense; financial services and general government; homeland security; legislative branch; labor, health and human services, and education; and [[page h1486]] state and foreign operations. the 2024 funding bills invest in america's future and deliver for the american people by: helping with the high cost of living, reducing drug costs, and prioritizing childcare and head start; siding with hardworking americans by supporting education, job training, and placement programs that help americans find high paying jobs, defending robust worker protection agencies that ensure americans are safe and properly compensated at work, and by ensuring billionaires and wealthy corporations pay the taxes they owe; protecting women's rights by blocking attempts to limit women's access to reproductive health care (including the elimination of title x family planning and teen pregnancy prevention grants) and supporting the reproductive health of women overseas; reinforcing america's global leadership by strengthening defense capabilities, ensuring america can respond anywhere in the world where freedom and democracy are under attack, amplifying american diplomacy, and reaffirming our global commitments to fight climate change and reinforce global health; and helping our communities be safe and secure by funding border security, preventing the trafficking of fentanyl and other dangerous drugs, bolstering cyber security, protecting consumers from scammers, fraudsters, and dangerous products, and enabling robust and immediate responses to natural disasters. like the first appropriations minibus, the bill rejects nearly all house republican riders. it also includes $1,383,069 in community project funding that will be going directly to my constituents that i know will have a profound impact on texas's 18th district. i am pleased that sec. p118-08-00 conveyance and detention improvements, $1,383,069, was included in homeland to be funded. it was my goal to fund as many of the 3,203 democratic projects across all 2024 funding bills as were eligible. i am proud of the hard work it took to get to this point in an unprecedented year for the house of representatives, and i hope that you will all join me in celebrating these direct investments in your community. these investments create jobs, making a real difference in the lives of so many in my district. i am proud to have fought for funding that will make our community healthier, safer, and stronger. funding the government is essential to our constituents, and i am happy that we were finally able to deliver. this legislation provides vitally needed and long-overdue funding that will improve the lives of the american people. house democrats have worked to deliver results to the american people and these projects, programs, services, and improvements will do just that. without the passage of this bill, the livelihood of millions of americans will be in jeopardy and the safety and security of the united states would be diminished. the passage of this legislation is vital, i support it enthusiastically, and urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bipartisan, essential legislation to fund our government. the speaker pro tempore (mr. lalota). the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from texas (ms. granger) that the house suspend the rules and agree
