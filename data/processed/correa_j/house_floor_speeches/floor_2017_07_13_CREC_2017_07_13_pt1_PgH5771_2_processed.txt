[congressional record volume 163, number 118 (thursday, july 13, 2017)] [house] [page h5771] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] require a score before the floor (ms. jayapal asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) ms. jayapal. mr. speaker, yesterday congressman brian higgins and i introduced h. res. 441, legislation that would require a congressional budget office score before a floor vote. this resolution clearly enshrines in house rules a fundamental and very simple principle of good governance: namely, we should know the budgetary and practical impact of legislation before we vote on it. frankly, mr. speaker, it should not be necessary for us to introduce this legislation. for years, the cbo has been an important nonpartisan player in crafting legislation and giving an independent assessment of what a bill costs and whom it will benefit or whom it will hurt. unfortunately, we have seen house leadership rush major legislation to the floor without a cbo score, preventing members from knowing the impact on their constituents and the budget before voting. the most egregious example, of course, was the may 4 vote on the trumpcare bill that barely passed this chamber and would strip 23 million americans of healthcare. that bill was rushed to the house floor before it had a cbo score, and members voted blindly on it without knowing the impact on their constituents. our resolution simply says transparency, accountability, and know what is in the bill. no score, no floor; it is that simple. ____________________
