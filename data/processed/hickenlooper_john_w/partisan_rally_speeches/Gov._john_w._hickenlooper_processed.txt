times washington bureau jackie coms. before joining the la times miss coms was a white house correspondent for the new york times and chief political correspondent for the wall street journal. without further ado please join me in welcoming to the stage jackie coms and governor john hickin-lupor. thank you very much all of you for coming out. i usually did these things that was after dark and in fact the last time i was here just tell you how much things have changed i was set up i was sitting along there and was a year a little over a year ago and we were talking trade and the trans-pacific partnership and how it was dead and trade free trade in general was in question and yet here we are. now trump is talking about actually revisiting that all or then again maybe not it depends. if it is two as they say if it is tuesday trump or thursday trump they contradict each other. i was really pleased to come here to be the person who gets to question governor hickin-lupor. it was mentioned that he drank beer at his what had been his original brew pub with president obama. i was the pool reporter literally at that day for the white house visit to denver for the president's visit. so there i was for a long time next to the pool table watching these two guys drink beer when i could not and play pool when i could not and i thought he let the president beat him but he swears the president did it fair and square and then a second time once we left. what is not well known is that the president and i do not think this has ever been reported you can correct me but the president had a pool table on the third floor of the white house and he when he had complicated things to think about he would go up there and shoot pool just to kind of have something to do while i was really trying to think through gnarly issues. i lost fairly and squarely but he had an unfair advantage in practice. well i thought neither one of you had an advantage because i find i play much better pool when i drink a lot neither you two it only had one drink but anyway i digress. because the governor's from colorado i was struck in a little bit hearing his background i want you to briefly tell the folks a little about your pedigree because it is not at all from colorado and in fact goes back to the founding era the moris is of pennsylvania so talk about the your the moris is in the hickenloopers briefly and then get yourself to colorado and i will take over. i gave you the concise version so my mother's family my mother's a moris was from old philadelphia family she was 12th generation in philadelphia and my father was also john john hickenlooper he was from cincinnati so it was kind of this confluence of and i never you know my father died when i was quite young when i just turned eight years old and i was raised by my mother i was the youngest of four kids and my mother's old philadelphia family lost all their money in their impressions so there was no great advantage as a matter of fact close close i could see zero advantage to being a moris and basically was ill-suited i was ill-suited as a moris or as anyone for school i was skinny i thick glasses i was dyslexic i never got an a in high school never got an a in college and i guess i overcompensated learning how to get along with people i was kind of bullied when i was a kid but got finally got to got accepted to wesleyan university which in those days was much easier to get into and studied english until my friends convinced me that i sucked as a writer as i was about to graduate so they had a special program for getting a master's in geology for non-science background people so i went back and i took a one-year special as a special student and then i enrolled as a geology an earthen environmental science graduate student and finally got a degree did two summers north of yellowstone park in the high up saracas of research and ultimately after nine and a half years got my finished and left wesleyan some of the geology professors joined together and got a sheet of sheep's skin and and gave me ten years as a student but anyway so that as a geologist that is how i got to colorado there you know geology denver was about the only place where there were still hiring geologists in the late 70s early 80s well to fast forward to the present you are here you were earlier today with governor bill haslam of tennessee who is a republican governor to do a panel you are known for getting together with john kasich the republican governor of ohio and possibly somewhat have it that you are going to run on a third party or unity ticket with him you can address that and then you have made a foray to iowa this month i think april 3rd right but it was not your usual checking out iowa if you are at all interested in the white how you were there again with the republican governor kim reynolds of iowa on about education i think and workforce development and so that is sort of you and republican governors that is sort of an odd way to sort of you know maneuver towards figuring out if you are going to run for the democratic nomination for president so do you is there a method to your madness? no it is certainly not politically astute you know i think it is important right now and i began working with kasich i recruited him because i had heard from other republican governors that he was adamant against rolling back coverage especially for medicaid as you know all the covers had been expanded under the affordable care act he wanted to protect it and i thought it was important that we have a republican and a democrat both agreeing to certain compromises about what we could do to strengthen the aca and make sure we did not roll back coverage and yet recognizing both of us that we have to control the incredible medical inflation what that is going to the federal budget and to our state budgets so kasich was and it is interesting he is been in politics i mean i never ran for student council or a class president he is been in politics for i mean him so high-o-state yes in 1994 he was the chair of the house budget committee i mean back to 94 so he knows so much about politics and we were just a good i really like him we are very different we are not going to run together that will never happen but i think it is important that we see some models of republicans and democrats trying to address some of these really difficult issues and so to the gets to the point in the age of polarization and people are saying the democratic party is moving farther left in the age of trump so this is very much at odds with what you think a person do you think well do you think your party is moving more to the left as a response to trump or or that is exacerbating a move that was already underway well certainly there is there is a level and i think it is exacerbating a move that was already underway i guess i should not say it is exacerbating sounds like a pejorative like i think it is not a right so just it is not amplifying yeah yeah is it amplifying that kind of a move i think that is fair to some extent certainly the vocal parts of the party a lot of the younger democrats and and well democrats of all ages feel very strongly they want a single pair you know universal coverage but a single pair they want to make sure that you know unions are are much stronger than they are i think the two sides of the democratic party are not that far off right now i am a big supporter of universal coverage i just think politically we can get there quicker than trying to change the whole system to you know a single pair you know that is not that big a difference when you actually get down to it now people in today's climate people roll up their sleeves and ready to do get any difference right in their own party or against the other party but i i think most of the most democrats agree on the basic core elements of what democratic party stands are right civil rights social justice supporting small businesses and the creation of jobs making sure that that there is what i have been calling uh you know inclusive prosperity where everybody gets a share of the economic growth of the community i think most again democrats will fight over different parts of that but most of those core elements are shared by everybody and i want to stay on that a second but i first let us just get it out what what is your interest in 2020 are you running the first interview that i have done where someone does it right in the beginning usually it is right at the very end so i can keep you nervous the whole time yeah exactly i was not talking no usually that allows me to stall and just kind of flip flam you know get get away from the question let us get it over um so i am i have i have about the best team of people that i am working with that i have ever had public service or when i was in business i have got a cabinet just hired a couple new people for my last year and i am term limited out who are remarkably talented and we are doing stuff around health care as i was describing i think we we have held the the inflation of medicaid and the state of colorado but almost flat for for two years actually be down a little bit uh we are doing a workforce stuff i mean apprenticeships uh and not just for plumbing electric electricians but for you know people want to work in a bank or insurance company kids can go and be an apprentice work a couple days a week and then go study a couple days a week and then what they have study not only will get them their high school degree but to make them more successful at their job kids love it the businesses love it and and i think that kind of workforce preparation and training is crucial so long story we had three or four i think ground breaking powerful initiatives that were that were really pushing the moment i start talking about well here's why i think i am right for 2020 here's what i am going to do and here's how i would articulate what what i bring to the table as soon as i put the time into that and and that all those being able to have those to articulate those things takes time you have to think through your language what is your elevator speech you have to do all that the moment i start putting time into that not only am i distracted but i distract my cabinet all these amazing people that have you know some of them just got one year to finish putting together the vision that go the integrated coherent plan around what we are going to do about workforce so i would i tell everyone i am honest you know i will talk i talk about with my wife we talk it is a tremendous compliment that someone like yourself would even ask me but i am my focus right now is a hundred percent on finishing strong well you say that but you are not in denver today and you are not going to be in denver tomorrow you are going to be in washington tomorrow and you have been these other places so there is a certain so there are things you have to do if you have any it is just a given if you are going to run for president the united states after the midterms are over this the like wednesday after the inter midterm results are in the presidential races often running but you have to do you are doing things right now anybody who is interested so so what are those kind of things you are talking you you are like given example you are talking to people here in chicago well but i am not doing like to be tutor not to tutor but to to learn you know sort of national politics and policy so when i get a chance so if i was really preparing to run for president probably would not sit up on a stage in front of 250 people with a very moderate republican governor and talk about all the places we can find compromising and where we think we can move things forward in our states and we you know governors are less partisan than almost any other elected official we love to steal each other's best ideas and and and and i know for a fact bill haslund's gonna steal a couple of my best ideas i talked about today he will go back to tennessee he will make him better he will improve him and then in two years i will steal them right back right and they will be even better and then he will steal them back we do that all the time that is not preparation for running for president now you know i did uh uh uh drove back uh david axel was kind of enough to come moderate that so drove back and then spent uh an hour with him talking asking so what is it like what should i be thinking about right so when i come in contact with people like that uh i i avail myself of the opportunity but i am going to dc not for any of those meetings but to talk to the recreation industry outdoor recreation industry which is we have been helping organize them into a uh political action arm where they are gonna they are gonna for the first time get involved in local politics but around clean air clean water public lands no not gonna be partisan again of no use in a democratic primary but i think an opportunity to begin rethinking how we politically organize ourselves in this country uh and you know begin to address i mean think about it county commissioners or municipal elections where a lot of people running are coming out of that kind of that that mantra of clean air clean water public lands those are values that many many people really care about let me go back quickly to health care you said you were sympathetic to single payer system or supportive of sure but you thought the best way is to sort of transition there by making better what we have now what exactly do you think we should do at the federal level to make the health care system better sure especially since arguably the obamacare system quote unquote is being sabotaged at the some the some of the states um and at the federal level by some of the rules that have been put out so that many insurance companies including two just last week are blaming you know regulations coming out of washington for forcing them to raise premiums you know whether it is true or not that is what they are willing to say what do we need to do to make it work better so in the private markets i think uh and again this is what case it can i was and it ended up being five republican governors and five democratic governors looked at the csrs in other words the little bonuses that are paid for people that are working and do not make quite enough money to really be able to afford private insurance on the exchanges say what csr stands for i cannot cost reduction i know cost cost reduction reduction subsidies cost subsidy reduction csrs is that right thank you you know the acronyms in this business if you are i am dyslexic so i get always the letters wrong and there is all i mean it is a nightmare you have no idea that is all right my biggest fear of someone asked me that question i do not i look like a nitwit um but anyway the csrs will allow more people to get the stay in and when they are actually going the opposite way i thought a few weeks ago with the continuing resolution we were very very close to getting csrs and then the other thing is a high cost a high cost fund you have certain people a small number but very expensive patients who have chronic diseases you know some complications around diabetes but we have several patients in colorado that spend between 500,000 and a million dollars a year in healthcare costs and they are covered that cost on the on the on the exchange so that raises the the premiums on the exchange dramatically so the idea is we get on a much broader pool little slivers of money from everybody and and use that to cover these very high cost patients that would dramatically we the estimate was by you know more than 30% would reduce the premiums on our exchanges which again would attract more people into the exchanges get more people insured which i think almost everybody agrees is a very good way to reduce uh overall cost or the growth of medical inflation so those are a couple obvious places to start uh but i think we have to go uh medicate as well if we are going to continue to roll out medicaid to other states tennessee still has not been been able to get through their legislator legislature even though governor haslam has been so supportive right but i think we have got to look at every way we can both in the private markets and the public markets to uh find ways to motivate and incentivize people to do a better job of taking care of their own potential medical ailments earlier that is one you know i can give you 10 different things but that is one right um you know one example we did in colorado uh and we had to use foundation money to begin with but for five years we got grants little over five million dollars a year uh actually it is been published so i can say it was from the susan buffett foundation and we provided long acting reversible contraception to young women who asked for it and in every case if they came through a state clinic we would always say you are too young to be having sex we advised you not to do this but if you are going to make a bad decision do not compound it with a second bad decision and so nor plants iuds but each year i mean we have reduced teenage abortion by over 70 percent it is actually over 72 percent in the last seven years in colorado that is controlling cost dramatically you know teenagers especially when they have uh unwanted pregnancies and they either abortion or especially when they have a child with they are not ready they are not planning for that child the cost to the system is really significant oftentimes they are premature there are all kinds of other medical complications that increase cost allowing young women to decide to have children when they are ready it is a huge it is it is not only medically safer but a huge cost reduction as well do you think the democratic party is moving farther left you know again i think that the core values are the same as they have always been i think there are a number of people that have been so frustrated and it is almost like we are you know the cable news cycles you picked the news show you want to watch and you get a steady diet of things that are going to rage you will get you angry and more committed to the things that your party wants and i think in many cases makes people less willing to compromise that might have the appearance of driving the party left but i am not sure that we have moved that far far from the basic you know we want equal opportunity for everyone we want that you know again inclusive prosperity where opportunity is shared evenly by everybody i have a question but i am going to start what made me think of it so i was reading and the rolling stone article came out just last week right yeah it has a baby boomer if you would ever told me i would be in rolling stone i would have laughed in your face well of course rolling stone is going to profile the governor of the state that is most prominently legalized weed it took him a long time just for the record i did not know but in that article you explicitly would not you there was some discussion of daca the deferred action for childhood arrivals program that is the result you all probably all know this but i will say it anyway the executive orders that president obama issued in 2012 in order to allow legal status in work permits and school opportunities to people who had been in the country i guess you had to have come in before 2007 roughly but in any case brought children children that were brought here are people that were brought here as children so you were being asked about the fact that this basically died in congress president trump rescinded those orders he gave congress six months to act they did not act the lifeline is that federal court has as you know stepped in and said it is put it in a bay where you can take you can renew beneficiaries applications you just cannot grant new ones now so that is the fact you were asked explicit you were asked about that and you bemoaned it and supported the daca recipients but you explicitly would not criticize trump for that or the geopolitics and i just mindless act i heard but i did not really want to criticize the person yeah and you said you so this leads to my question is how anti-trump are you prepared to be as you sort of go out so i you know as i grew up as i said the skinny kid with cook bottle glasses and you know acne my dad when i was a little kid told me that if i could not talk my way out of a fight you deserve to get left but you also learn if you are if you are being bullied sometimes you just have to punch the kid in the face and you might get beat up that day but generally he will never bully you again right that is a pretty good rule um i think trump is a bully and i think that we need to address him on his own turf and i do not mean that means shouting back or calling him names or or dealing with him the way he deals with his world but i do think it means we have to be better at using his uh inductives against him and and and somehow pointing out ways that well how what a joke it is and i i think it is more powerful to look at some of the things i mean he claims to be a a patriot right he claims to be for you know make america great again well american democracy as as great a form of government as it is it is very fragile if you look at the some of the things he is doing he is attacking the fundamental foundations right a free media an independent free media he relentlessly attacks the media uh the judiciary an independent judiciary that is a you know the rule by law is an essential characteristic of american democracy the the national security apparatus the fbi the military all i mean whenever it suits his purpose he attacks him that cannot go unanswered right and and taking dock i hear the dock of kids who are you know most of them came here when they are one or two or three years old they have no home to go back to right to say that we they are gonna we are gonna send them to their quote-unquote home is absurd uh but i do not think it you know to get into a name calling or that kind of attack is probably uh not as useful as as finding ways to to use his weight against him just the way in jujitsu or many martial arts you turn someone's uh size against them so there is a lot of talk that you know you see you do you see the candidates for 2020 having to balance how much your anti-tune terms of you know responding to what the democratic voters or democratic leanik and voters want to balance an anti-trump um approach with presenting a new policy agenda i mean that because because you hear that a lot on the cable television news shows including those that are sympathetic to democrats that democrats do not have a message i mean the a look at the economy that brought obama created uh you know year after year and i think it again it was not a perfect economy but he came into office with the worst recession in a hundred years right you have to go back to the great depression to find a uh a environment as challenging and deep recessions like that usually have a long tail so in other words for a number of years we needed to expect a dampening effect on job creation well despite that i mean he had one of the most uh one of the most successful presidencies in terms of job creation and the economy as any president we have had in memory uh you know to to say that the democrats somehow you know are not up to the task and again president obama was not a master economics it was not job-draweries a community organizer really and he really focused more on on making sure that civil rights were protected that you know he tried to really try to play a role in a lot of those difficult waters uh and yet using basic democratic principles our economy did amazingly well and i think you know there are some things we could do better in the economy um but we did a lot of things and again attacking trump is going to be that will be uh that will be a a the anti to play at the poker game of 2020 what everyone's going to have to be able to attack trump i think that is just the nature of political enterprise right but i think we will see a whole ton of ideas economic ideas we will see ideas around solutions to social challenges uh all manner of representations coming out of the democratic party that a lot of people have i have heard two people potential candidates who have so a couple pretty good ideas they do not want to talk about it necessarily because then everyone else just comes to their idea not just saying sort of the way you governers deal each other's ideas no governers we would love to be stolen from other candidates less so maybe not so much um i am going to stay on trump a second because you know to uh segue from last night's show abc interview with james comey in which um george stephanopoulos asked comey is president trump fit to be president i want to put that question to you well comey's no longer an office so he has an easier time um if you look at the at the how rapidly he changes his mind and how easily influenced he is by you know emotional context or what someone said to him or what he sees on a on a on a cable news program certainly that suggests that he does not have a lot of the character that we usually associate with someone being a president on fit to be president yeah probably you know uh i mean there is certain things we should expect of our leaders at that level and it is more than just consistency right it is a belief in facts right and and and a willingness to do things for others without regard to your own self interest i think that you know my biggest i will tell you what i worry about them maybe not the most but as much as anything is the model that he is setting for kids and that is i do not know how long it is going to take us to recover from i mean i have got a son who is 15 and a half and i mean well all his friends and we all the parents everybody always trying to make sure they understand that serving others is a great thing and it ultimately makes you happier and that doing something not for your own benefit but for the benefit of the community is kind of what democracy is all about and why that is a good thing uh president trump kind of flies in the face of that and makes and they are made they are joking about him right i mean he is in in many of the circles of my son runs and trust me these are not just democratic families they think he is kind of a joke but they are still seeing this behavior and it is being modeled for them at a very high level and we have also seen a much i mean a significant uptick in gracious stuff written on buildings or you know bullying behavior in the in the playgrounds i am curious um in colorado what was his percentage of the vote he lost by about almost five points okay and then what is the state yeah and what is his job approval today last fall i do not get to see as many polls i should so i am not but as of three is it lower than the percentage he got oh yes you are not sure yeah no he is that he is at uh i think 38 percent or 37 percent of approval rating very very low approval rating and he is been lower i exactly he is actually come back up a little bit and like nationally does that surprise you that he is that low given that you know the economy's humming along and all the other things he takes credit for i think the better question is it surprised me he is still high as high as that right i mean it yeah a lot of people ask that it is well it is just uh you know it is a balancing actually right the the economy is doing well you go to all these businesses and say hey we are going to give you a you know take your your taxes down right from 35 percent to 21 percent is that a good thing for your business yeah of course and there is then people will not go to invest in those businesses long term it is not going to be a solution right and long term what that does to the deficit i think is going to probably harm business but that is going to take a couple years to come through right but it certainly makes people happy in the short term and i think that is part of the reason why he is still as high as he is yeah well let me the economy makes me want to ask you at policy related question again because let us say well one in between that one so how do you see this ending do you see a constitutional crisis ahead do you see him even resigning or do you see him running for reelection against you in 2020 you know on the facts that we know so far and you know i mean i grew up during water gates right so i cannot remember i can remember saying this to my mother saying you know i cannot believe the president would ever do something like that now could not i will never say that again right and especially with president trump who knows where this is going to lead but based on what we know now as factual i do not think he is going to resign i do not think as as tantalizing the prospect might be i do not think it is impeachable at least as i understand understand impeachment processes and you know my guess is he will run for reelection well he is certainly i mean i am yours i would say you are starting early and yet he is he is starting well not not all that early just as you turn the key does not mean i am starting he i have never seen this happen before he started running for reelection the day after he was sworn in and just today in my inbox there was the email boasting of how much money trump for president has raised and it is pretty remarkable so yeah i would think i am going to sneak in one policy question now this last policy question indulge me do not wonky-ness here wonky-ness alert and then i am going to turn it over to you all so get ready to take the mic since we were talking about the economy and the tax cuts given projections most we saw most recently by the congressional budget office this month project that their projections of the increased debt over the next 10 years is now up 1.6 trillion dollars from what it already was and we are already looking at a nine nine trillion in debt growth over the next 10 years and a lot of that just simply from the aging the baby boomers and they are drawing on the entitlement programs so if you or any other democrat were to get elected in 2020 take office in 2021 there is every chance in the world i think we would all predict that yours you would for the third time in a row have a third democratic president in a row would be taking office inheriting a higher deficit that had been driven up under this is not a partisan statement this is just a fact and so and but debt would be at levels of gdp that would be unsustainable and maybe at a you know higher than they have ever been since world war ii when there was an excuse for that percentage what would you do what would you do when your first budget or i am just talking general priorities you have got the main pieces the entitlement spending the discretionary spending and revenues well you want this job and again the challenge here you cannot you cannot sustain these kinds of deficits without running the risk of getting into a spiral we have had low inflation if inflation starts going up and we start raising interest rates right that means that we are going to have to spend more money to service the debt that we have which means we are going to have to borrow more money which means that debt's going to go up and need more money i mean it is a spiral i lived through the 1970s when you know when i bought my first house for 26,500 dollars in 1976 the mortgage rate was 14 percent 14 percent and there are other people that were borrowing money all the time at 16 and 18 percent i mean these were crazy times because this spiral got out of control so the first priority has to be to figure out some combination of new revenues and lowering expenses and costs so you get that back under control so you are not you are not at risk of something that just runs away from you you want to rule out curbing the growth of entitlement spending you know i think that you know i think that the that all the entitlements have to look that together and i think that the you know we are working right now in colorado on the trying to get the pension squared away and it is it seems easy for people well why does not it take just right to check and pay more money it is the same kind of thing we have got to figure out how to get what are the other levers that allow you i mean if we end up continue to spend more more money on entitlements at some point we are not going to have any money for anything else right and i think that the first step is to say all right let us stop the growth of entitlements and figure out what that looks like right but again each entitlement has a very powerful lobby that is absolutely you know they have got one one pathway to victory and that is to make sure their entitlement continues to grow at the rate of spend same thing with medical inflation we have got the same got hospitals you have got doctors you have got the pharmaceutical companies you have got the insurance companies each group has their single pie shape of self interest that they want to that their lobbyists get get bonuses from well somehow we have got to get everybody to table and say all right everyone's got to kind of share the burden but we cannot do things we have done it before yeah because it is interesting it would be the progressive are i mean the progressives and liberals have always wanted to protect entitlement programs justifiably but there is now an argument that as you keep squeezing all these discretionary programs that go to so many things as you know that progressives value whether it is environment education research and science and women's infant children health programs that you you know how progressive is that if you are you know and then there is revenues and then so democrats fearful of the tax and spend label well that is why i think that you it is got to be done within a context of frugality and joe it is funny my mom was a depression child and her her father ironically i was i guess you would call coincidentally but he tried to open it is still re at the end of prohibition so in 1933 they repealed the volstad act he would been boot lagging not for his friends he was not in business but he would been making apple brandy and he thought he could he thought he would get out ahead of everybody take longer to age good whiskey he could beat them and he made some bad calculations and and he lost almost everything so my mom i mean she never bought a dress i mean she is so she learned to sew and she sewed pretty much everything she wore and as much as she could for the rest of us however much we might complain she would wash chin foil tap into the refrigerator door and reuse it saran wrap i mean she was the height of frugality she thought that money was as insurance in case something bad happened it was not for pleasure or luxury and there is got to be some return to that sense of of the value of the dollar and and making sure that we all see the interrelationship between water investments and what are you know however important but what are are you know things that are more than what is it absolutely needed all right now for the good questions like david said students first for at least the first three and identify yourself and have that question mark at the end of your statement sure so i am andrew i am a 30 year undergrad here public policy major and i was wondering since you have been working bipartisan both on a state and larger level since before president trump got elected if there is been a change in tone or the way that you and your republican colleagues work together either before you or the whole big course of it or just obama and then interesting good interesting question and it depends on the person so there are some republicans and some democrats that are by nature collaborative and like working together there are others that are kind of enjoy those opportunities to poke the other guy to you know to to grab political advantage whether they can you know bill hasel the governor of tennessee brian santa moll the governor of nevada there are you know republicans that are generally always collaborative steve bullock governor montana i mean they are go down maggie hassan who is governor new hampshire now the center of new hampshire they are by nature collaborative and try to find ways to help other states whether it is a republican or a democrat you know when the when the volkswagen settlement for that for the corrupt diesel crisis that they went through when that money began being allocated the the western mountain states all banded together agreed that we are going to use our money and we are all going to commit to creating a network for rapid recharging stations for electric vehicles well it turns out that they say six of them have republican governors and yet in the end they they all signed off on this and we spent a bunch of time kind of talking with each other whether the pros or the cons but i think those kinds of things when you get governors away from their hurly burly of an election they they are able to more easily look at what is the what is the best outcome for our whole community thanks. hello governor thank you for coming first my name is chris i am a law student here at the university of chicago i should purpose my question with two things one i do not mean it to have implications beyond the end of your term as governor and two i have the distinct pleasure of working for your obviously legal counsel this summer on them so i am genuinely curious i am curious if you would not mind elaborating on your sort of paradigm for judicial nominations how you think through who to nominate not to nominate and and how you make those kinds. this is such a good question the and i do not know do you still have a law professor here named douglas beard we do yeah she is still here yeah professor very does fantastic so he just so you know he grew up his older brother was my best friend growing up what a small world and i guess i was very very competitive when i was young and we would go play with a wall in the back yard of the beards and at the end of every day his he douglas and his brother harry and their other brother bruce will all go back in after a hard day of with a wall and the first thing their mother would say is well did you guys learn any new hicken loop holes because he was evidently i would say well if the wind was blowing in the ball gets stuck in the head it should not be a double it should be a triple but the wind's blowing out you know all this could be discussed it if i try to be fair and try to get everyone to agree to these things but anyway so you come from a good when i opened my restaurant in 1988 one of my customers had gotten a lot of great from new yorkshire chicago and says you know somebody named douglas beard said yeah of course he goes you know he tells some funny stories about you when he talks about contract law and about how any language can be manipulated and how good you are at it as a child so in terms of so i have now appointed we have seven supreme court justices in colorado i have now appointed four as a non-lawyer and and i think it is fair to say that in my business i opened 15 brewpubs all over the country mostly in the western united states i did five real estate development projects fairly good size i had over 200 investors on a busy year i would have a million customers and i have never been sued and i have never sued anyone so i have never been in court so me on my judicial philosophy obviously trial lawyers are not you know they are not wild about my judicial philosophy i am just kidding that is a joke what i have tried to do is find people that were socially liberal again placed an emphasis on civil rights and social justice but that were also pro-business and others high ethical standards high environmental standards were not going to sacrifice the environment or or how we how a business relates to its community but that we wanted that to be pro-business even as we had you know these high civil rights and social justice these other social issues and i think that is pretty much if you go look at the four i have appointed they are pretty different but they all come into that pattern well thank you very much you bet and look forward to seeing next summer hello governor thank you for being here today my name's kian i am a second-tier biologist and my question has to do with the position for medical for medical innovation in future healthcare policy as a biologist it is cool to see lots of the new growth within within the field and the new technologies that we will have in the future but how do you see those fitting into a into a robust national health health care system that prizes medical innovation while also tries to keep costs down sure well done properly medical innovation becomes one of the key ingredients to controlling cost that being said medical innovation is now moving so rapidly and i you know somehow society is going to figure out the policies by which we look at which choices do we allow each other to make how do we assess the impacts and consequences of those choices and and and what is that going to what is that going to mean in terms of our our you know our economy and how businesses operate certainly medical innovation has such amazing potential to you know solve so many things and again even the things that are happy now i never dreamed i would believe i just i still cannot believe some of the stuff that i am reading about but it is just going to keep going right the knowledge is not going to stop and it is just going to raise a bunch of ethical questions i think those are probably even more important than worrying getting too caught up into the you know what are the you know is innovation going to get slowed down or stymied by the like was you were you asking about whether innovation would slow down the economy or whether regulation would slow down innovation i was more of asking just how do just how do we fit medical innovation into us into our future of healthcare particularly as programs right particularly as programs like the grants that are provided by the nrh are are becoming increasingly on the chopping clock to be decreased so i am trying to figure out how how innovation will fit into america's medical future i think it is going to i think well to to quote one highly elected official i think it is going to be huge and i do i think it has to be innovation there is probably no better investment for our economy than to to invest in the research and there is a guy named richard florida who wrote a book called the the rise of the creative class and we took some of the points from that that that if you create a a a community you know a sequence of neighborhoods and and and they are oriented towards young people so often government always the decisions on how government spends infrastructure usually made by men over 50 right and so of course they are things that young people do not care so much about we try when i got elected mayor even though i was over 50 we try to get a lot of young people involved and i mean metro denver now has over a thousand miles of bike trails we now have more live music venues in austin or nashville we now look at you know obviously we have more brew pubs than anybody but but i think that comes right back to innovation that you that you want to the the real future of of it is not just medicine but it is of of our country is going to be tied to how successfully we innovate and right now it is a pendulum that they are if they are cutting those grants i would bet my life that within you know four or eight years suddenly that people will be putting massive amounts of research back into those grants so that so that we can continue to innovate thank you governor hi governor my name is mike ralfiss i am the executive director of renew chicago and as such we spend a lot of time kind of worrying about the future of our city and our state and the one thing that colorado and tennessee seem to have common in common are moving vans coming from the state of illinois and so you know you diluted to pensions and we have an enormous pension problem here and even when they are we can find common ground they seem to be getting validated by the courts so my my question is sort of how did the colorado miracles sort of happen and what are the things that are outside of our control obviously we do not have sunshine and mountains the way you do but what are you know we would be happy to steal a couple of good ideas from tennessee and colorado so you have something to share something to share for us for how we can reinvigorate illinois would be grateful sure and i mean you do so much it is chicago just for the record i think is one of the most successful metropolitan areas in the world and i look at look at millennium park there is a millennial park yeah but that is amazing that was came out of your civic pride businesses and individuals and philanthropists came together said how can we make this a magnet for people not just all over illinois but everywhere so take that asset you have got and and obviously you are involved in a big part of that you know keep that is muscle you do not want to lose a tone jim clifton who is the ceo of gallup sent me some information that shows that people when they begin to doubt and distrust their local government so their city government their state government when they hear about all the you know the malfeasance or the corruption they that if you look at the states where they have the largest out migration of people which illinois is one of the worst right now and yet you look at how many people distrust state government right you have got at least one former governor at a prison in colorado i am aware of my you need to but i think that those according to jim clifton they track very closely and i do not think that is just a coincidence i think people want to be in a place where they believe in their government and one of the challenges and this is we see this both republicans and democrats is how do we rebuild that that people's trust in belief in government again and it is not going to be easy i mean president trump is not making it easy in any way but one thing you can do and you already have done you want to have the graced education especially higher education facilities you guys i mean they are you are right up there with with you know came virgin boston in terms of the depth of of resource that you have here that is the part the richard florida's richard farah says a single closest correlation to your future economic prosperity is your investment in higher education the more dollars being spent per kid and higher ed more research the the stronger your economy will eventually be and i would tack on to that k-12 as well those investments are critical thank you hi governor tom knight from the healthcare industry here in chicago have an innovation and policy question and healthcare for you with dignity health and chi emerging you will have the largest nonprofit in your backyard with a strong sense of corporate social responsibility have you considered leveraging section 1334 which is the multi-state exchange plan option that is actually an option in the aca that is still alive to create a multi-state plan across the west in their footprint and experiment with now a large idn and insurance companies participation to see if you can bring down costs and create an exchange option that would be more effective in providing care to particularly self-insured individuals i have not that does not mean they are not people i mean luckily we have many people a lot smarter than i am working in healthcare not just in colorado but around but that that kind of you know i do not know enough to to endorse it but that is something i would love to look at i think the more you can in healthcare the nice thing about the large nonprofits is that they really do have a nobility right a lack of self-interest i mean obviously they are executives get bonuses and paid on certain amount of success but basically they have a very different frame of self-interest than than for-profit hospitals and systems and being able to allow them to merge and begin to get to scale probably should you know allow us to get you know really restrained that inflation i was talking about before medical inflation so if there is there someplace that is written up where i can look at i will figure out a way to connect that guy right behind you in the tie is my wrangler you figure out a way to connect to give you a card great a couple one-liners thank you thank you actually split my time between chicago and about five blocks from 18th and one coup oh no kidding i guess my question is is illinois obviously is not doing well financially and with the democratic nominee for governor wanting to make marijuana recreationally legal i think there is some people who see that as maybe a stop gap or a solution to some of our tax problems how has that worked in colorado because i know a lot of that was earmarked for education i believe first 40 million yeah first 40 million okay but i still think colorado is still on the lower end of k-12 i guess i will show you the higher education so go ahead oh no that was i did not know so people are trying to think that this might be a solution or a panacea to our tax problems and then what have you seen that i guess the extra money in colorado so colorado has a you know rough justice a 12 billion dollar general fund total budgets 30 billion dollars marijuana tax money last year was 210 220 million dollars it is a drop in the bucket right it is not going to get you all day kindergarten it is not going to get you early childhood education it is not going to get you any of those laudable public policy desires but they are all very expensive it does allow you well first let me say i opposed it when it was proposed because i did not it is against it is in conflict with federal law that is no fund as a governor and no one else had ever legalized it even after damn had only decriminalized it so we had to create it from scratch but our voters passed it 55 to 45 and so we did it we did the best we could and we made some dumb mistakes we did not regulate edibles quickly enough or aggressively enough quickly enough but i think overall many of the things we feared have not happened we thought we would see a spike in consumption no spike in consumption we thought teenagers since we legalized it teenager we think was okay and let me tell you after you have got young kids or young grandkids this high tac marijuana every brain scientist i talked to feels there is a high probability that that even if you are only smoking or ingesting marijuana once a week your your synapses are coming together and your brain is growing so rapidly that the high tac marijuana has a very high probability of taking a little slipper of your long-term memory so if you did it just once a week for a month probably would not notice it but long-term they are almost everyone i have talked to is convinced that that is a serious serious hazard well by taxing marijuana i mean the same amount of marijuana we think is being smoked rough justice by taxing and we are able to get we are spending you know eight or ten million dollars a year marketing the dangers of consumption by teenagers and i think that kind of stuff we are using marijuana money almost twenty million dollars a year for the unintended consequences of drug use under the assumption that maybe that person's office is just trying to get out you can let them out they are they are the it is really distracted let him free you look at chronic homelessness right so many people who are chronically homeless huge expense to society and you know these folks almost always have mental health issues very hard to raise money for them but we find when we get them into supportive housing they get into housing and then they get you know medication if they have got you know real depression or other some some other condition that medication helps with we get them into job training so they can at least get a job where they come in and get to know have a social network that supports them we get that stuff to them they are very successful well to get that money for expensive supportive housing even though it is like one third the cost of leaving someone living on the streets it is very hard to get we are using marijuana for that almost twenty million dollars a year so they are benefits to it but it should not and it is not going to solve your tax problems for the state and i think you should not look at it as a source of revenue because i do not think it is a good thing for government to have an incentive to encourage people to do things that is not good for them well i mean whatever and again i made a i made a small fortune selling beer so do not do not think i do not understand the hypocrisy but we we were very careful we did not never cut and discounted our beer costs we wanted people to have a higher quality beer that they pay a you know 50% more the notion would be that they would not go out and get and get roasted i think marijuana is should be treated equivalent to alcohols for adults but at the same time i do not think that government should be suddenly lowering the taxes to try and sell more alcohol and i do not think they should be lowering taxes to you know to try and sell or doing anything to incentivize more consumption of drugs as there been as it has been measured the i guess secondary effects or the externalities of marijuana in regards to decreasing the amount of policing or prison or jail expenses certainly arrangements we and jail we are measuring that and we saw a dramatic camera 80% reduction in possession arrangements i guess the cost like yeah so they i have not seen that pulled together yet but i am sure they are looking on it we have time for two more questions which looks like about what unless i am very fast my name is jay and i am a physics meter in the college i guess my question is more twofold the first is due to increasing like living costs in the bay area a lot starts moving to denver so it is wondering what kind of policies ever in the state of colorado to support startups and the second question was more of like the overwhelming proportion of of tech entrepreneurs are actually more and more but it is very difficult for for entrepreneurs to start a business in the united states for example there is the international entrepreneurship peril but that only gives peril status not visa status and also in fact with the new presidency that homeless securities actually try to repeal the peril and if you look at nations like canada or other nations there is a start of visa and i was wondering if you ever decide to run for the presidency it will be on platform you will be willing to support a creation of a start of visa for it within the us so yes certainly and in terms of denver we are now according to the kaufman foundation in kansas city we are few ranked the last time they did a national ranking of those cities on a per capita basis that have the most startups for the top 10 were in colorado and we now have a startup week that is in october or end of september actually i take the back second week of september where this last year we had 19,000 people signed up with the paperwork and formally registered for startup week and it is you know where people come and get tools and workshops and how to be more successful at their startups so we are all about startups and it is a cult i mean it is right now one of the hippest things you can do in colorado even if whoever you are talking to could be i do not know a librarian and they could be a a service manager for you know manufacturing whatever they are doing if you are doing a startup you are of interest and it is really become a status and in terms of the immigrants i will tell you a funny theory and this is i have been trying this out i know i was not going to get to a short answer once you start talking about startups i was toast i believe now that many of the inclinations the genetic characteristics that we have that really help people be successful entrepreneurs and masters of startups are inherited and they argue about how much is nature how much is nurture how much is inherited how much is your family your culture but the people i have talked to who suggest maybe as much as two thirds of your inclination to be an entrepreneur your ability to assess risk versus reward and you know manager your your ideas in a way that you really can have a successful business the two thirds of that is is genetic i wonder and i would argue that immigrants are a whole class of immigrants they leave everything they know behind they come to a place and they have to plan out what they are going to do for a job and economy they have to kind of as just like an entrepreneur that they are making a startup of their lives if that is true that it is that a these qualities are inherited and b that immigrants are are a filter right now there is people that immigrate to a place generally are the people that are most likely the entrepreneurs from that society then you begin to explain why the u.s. is dominated the world economy for the last 70 years ever since the industrial revolution allowed entrepreneurs to have a much bigger leverage point on society and i think that is a fabulous way to begin rethinking how we talk to people that are anti immigration and begin talking about these kinds of visas to say hey this country one of the reasons we have been so successful is we have all these people and and each generation it can get diluted down but if everybody who is come here is somehow connected to that kind of slightly more or maybe even significantly more immigrant type or and more entrepreneurial type you know characteristics genetic characteristics that is a very powerful thing so that is just an idea not trying to publish anything yet right i think it is something that is worth considering in terms of immigrants and entrepreneurs thank you no pressure but we literally have 30 seconds for the last question oh we can be a minute late short question but probably a long answer i have learned to swift as of in the community i am a supporter of public education and i am wondering what you think we could do to reinvigorate our national belief in public education so that it would translate into the kind of program where you sounded impressive you know connecting job training and high school education but so that it would also translate into more states being willing to support early childhood education pre-k and all those things that we know really make a difference yeah well and i will give this the short i think public education has got to again break down some of the narrow self-interest and look at getting those different interests working together on a more regular basis you know we got a we got the public of the teachers union in colorado last year to support legalizing and putting into statute any local increase in in mill rates for others for local tax collection you raise the mill rate you get more taxes for your schools historically and in almost every state that only goes to the public schools it does not go to charter schools well we sat down with a lot of discussion and got the teachers union to at least stay neutral and allow this to get passed and basically is by showing them they have a broader self-interest than just this kind of narrow competition with charter schools which is so often counterproductive right what we said was if if the charter schools and and the public schools are both united in getting more resources for k-12 education and are more aligned your probability goes up dramatically of passing some sort of tax initiative or something gets more revenue and i think those kinds of alignments where public education can demonstrate a level of innovation you know my son went to a middle school where the teachers union agreed to let the principals do the schedules and the principal had this wild idea and he cut a deal with all the families basically they went from six and a half hours a day to eight hours and 15 minutes a day and they did that by having a quarter of the teachers come in an hour early and leave an hour early and a quarter of the teachers come in an hour later and leave an hour later so you basically added two hours on the school day in terms of teacher coverage a bunch of kind of study halls so longer school day and then they went to a longer school year which for which the teachers got paid more but the deal was no homework so this was a middle school they did this also in the core correlative you know kindergarten not kindergarten elementary school so parents loved it kids loved it if you told my if you never told me my son would say sure i would much rather go to school for eight hours and six and a half hours or say you are crazy he is never going to say that but in exchange for no homework and and that school jumped into the top five of middle schools in the state of colorado and it started with a 40% free and reduced lunch per percentage now of course middle class families are racing in and filling it so it is now much lower in terms of free and reduced lunch but that kind of innovation i think is going to be we have got to figure out how to get those ideas out and try them at scale and make sure that they are transferable but that is i think that is how people are going to believe in public education it is got to deliver. okay very quick thank you and bye so that we do not prevent you from making your plan. thank you to jackie for doing a fabulous job. thank you. now get out of here.
