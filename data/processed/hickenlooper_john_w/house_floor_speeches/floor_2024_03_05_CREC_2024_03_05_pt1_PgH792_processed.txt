public health service act (42 u.s.c. 282(b)(7)(b)(ii)); and (2) summarizes advancements made in pediatric research with funds allocated pursuant to such section. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from kentucky (mr. guthrie) and the gentlewoman from washington (ms. schrier) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from kentucky. general leave mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in the record on the bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from kentucky? there was no objection. mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 3391, the gabriella miller kids first research act 2.0. in the united states, it is estimated that nearly 10,000 children under the age of 15 will be diagnosed with cancer in 2024. major advancements over the past several decades have improved survival rates, with 85 percent of children with cancer now living until 5 years or older. however, estimates predict that, tragically, over 1,000 children will still die from cancer this year, making it the leading cause of death from disease for kids. this legislation would ensure progress toward a better understanding of childhood cancer and structural birth defects will continue. it would also prioritize nonduplicative research and coordination on pediatric research across the national institutes of health. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. schrier. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise to speak in support of h.r. 3391, the gabriella miller kids first research act 2.0. this bipartisan legislation, sponsored by representatives wexton and cole, plays a crucial role in providing essential support for pediatric cancer and disease research. this bill is named in honor of gabriella miller, a virginia resident who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor at the age of 10. gabriella was an inspirational activist who tirelessly advocated for research into childhood diseases like cancer until her passing in october 2013. her strong voice and bravery turned tragedy into the original gabriella miller kids first research act, which was signed into law in 2014. this research program at the national institutes of health has made progress toward understanding childhood cancer and disease. the original law established a 10-year pediatric research initiative fund and authorized funding for childhood disease research. the law has also led to the founding of the gabriella miller kids first data resource center, a comprehensive data resource for research and patient communities meant to advance discoveries. despite this progress, cancer is the top disease-related cause of death for children and teens in the united states. it is estimated that over 9,500 american children under age 15 will be diagnosed with cancer this year. mr. speaker, i thank my friend, representative wexton, for her leadership [[page h793]] on this legislation, and i encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to make a significant impact in the fight against pediatric cancer. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1545 mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from florida (mr. bilirakis), the chairman of the consumer protection and commerce subcommittee and a leader on consumer protection in this congress. mr. bilirakis. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. it has been great working with him all these years, and i appreciate him very much. i rise in strong support of h.r. 3391, the gabriella miller kids first research act 2.0. i am proud to be a co-lead on this bipartisan piece of legislation with my friend and colleague, representative jennifer wexton, who does an outstanding job on these issues. again, she is retiring at the end of this congress, and we are going to miss her. she did such wonderful work, particularly on the parkinson's bill, and we are going to get it across the finish line. i am grateful for her leadership on this particular bill, as well, to reauthorize the kids first pediatric research initiative at the national institutes of health. our bill will continue the critical work being done to conduct biomedical research and discover new insights into pediatric conditions such as childhood cancers. the kids first program has helped facilitate a better understanding of shared genetic pathways between childhood cancers, birth defects, and other pediatric conditions, and h.r. 3391 ensures that this research will continue for another 5 years. further, the gabriella miller kids first research act requires coordination of all federal efforts related to pediatric cancer research, as well as a report detailing current federally funded programs and initiatives and all advancements made thus far, and there have been several advancements. we all agree that these scientific discoveries could help unlock the key to developing future treatments and cures for our most vulnerable patients--our kids who suffer from pediatric cancers and rare diseases. we must continue to fight the battle against kids' cancers, both inside and outside the federal government. i urge my colleagues to support our bill, the gabriella miller kids first research act 2.0. ms. schrier. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time for the purpose of closing. mr. speaker, i simply would encourage all my colleagues to vote for this important bill to help cancer research, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. wexton. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of the gabriella miller kids first research act 2.0, which will enable the continuation of critical research of treatments and cures for childhood cancer and rare diseases. i am proud to carry this legislation in honor of gabriella, who was from virginia's 10th congressional district. gabriella was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and passed away in 2013 at age 10. gabriella was a fierce fighter not just in her own battle with cancer, but as an advocate on behalf of the millions of other children who have suffered from this terrible disease. in the months following her terminal diagnosis, gabriella became a national force for change, urging congress to ``stop talking--start doing,'' and increase funding to discover better treatments and cures. her heroic efforts delivered a successful push to pass the gabriella miller kids first research act in 2014, bipartisan legislation named in her honor. the kids first program has made remarkable progress since then--sequencing more than 55,000 genomes from over 21,000 patients in childhood cancer and structural birth defect cohorts and starting the gabriella miller kids first data resource center, a comprehensive data resource for research and patient communities meant to advance discoveries. but there is still a long fight ahead to better understand, treat, and ultimately cure childhood cancer. without action by congress, funding for this critical program is set to expire this year. we must do better for our kids, and this bipartisan legislation would enable the critical work of the kids first program to continue. for the millers, and for the millions of american families who have had to go through the horror of receiving a cancer diagnosis for their child, i ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important legislation. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from kentucky (mr. guthrie) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3391, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________
