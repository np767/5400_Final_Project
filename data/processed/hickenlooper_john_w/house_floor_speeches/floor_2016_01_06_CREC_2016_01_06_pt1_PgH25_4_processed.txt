[congressional record volume 162, number 3 (wednesday, january 6, 2016)] [house] [page h25] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] planned parenthood (mrs. lawrence asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) mrs. lawrence. mr. speaker, we have barely started 2016 and here we are, about to take our 62nd vote to dismantle the affordable care act and facing the 11th attack on women's health care in the 114th congress. defunding planned parenthood and dismantling the aca will rob hardworking americans of affordable family planning, and it will strip life-saving cancer screenings away from millions of women across the country. as congress, we have not taken 62 votes to improve women's health and access to healthcare programs for women and seniors. the 114th congress has not declared war on the appalling lack of healthcare, nutrition, and mental health programs. but here we are again, wasting valuable tax dollars in order to rehash the ideology of a loud few, one that hurts women and our most vulnerable of constituents. this is just a sad and shameful day. congress, this must stop. ____________________
