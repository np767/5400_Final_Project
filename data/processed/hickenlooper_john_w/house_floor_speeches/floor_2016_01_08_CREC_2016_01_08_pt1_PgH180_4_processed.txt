[congressional record volume 162, number 5 (friday, january 8, 2016)] [house] [page h180] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] gun control executive actions (mrs. lawrence asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) mrs. lawrence. mr. speaker, i rise today to applaud the president's executive actions to curb gun violence and urge my colleagues to take the action needed to address this deadly plague. i rise today in honor of more than 300 lives lost to gun violence in detroit, a city i represent, just in 2015. that is nearly as many lives as we have days in the year. we have failed to take meaningful action. we must pass legislation to support the president's executive actions. we have heard a lot of dialogue this week. if you do not like the executive actions, then congress must rise and let us take the action needed. we can no longer sit on the sideline and allow this plague and this horrific violence in our country to continue. we must take action now before another day passes and another innocent life is destroyed. ____________________
