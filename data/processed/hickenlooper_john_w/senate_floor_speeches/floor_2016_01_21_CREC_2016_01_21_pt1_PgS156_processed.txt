[congressional record volume 162, number 12 (thursday, january 21, 2016)] [senate] [page s156] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] vote explanation mr. warner. mr. president, i regret missing the vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the veto message on s.j. res. 22, a bill that would block implementation of the waters of the united states rule and prevent the environmental protection agency and army corps of engineers from reissuing a regulation that is substantially similar in the future. i voted against s.j. res. 22 last fall and, had i been present, i would have voted to uphold the president's veto. while this rule is not perfect, it provides important environmental protection efforts. ____________________
