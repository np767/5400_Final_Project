[congressional record volume 162, number 8 (wednesday, january 13, 2016)] [house] [pages h357-h358] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] right to life (mr. rokita asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. rokita. mr. speaker, the declaration of independence records for posterity the fact that we have been given by our creator certain unalienable rights. among these, of course, are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [[page h358]] these rights extend to all persons, even those who are physically with us, but yet unborn. indeed, life inside a mother versus outside of her is ultimately a matter of geography. the rights of the unborn must be protected, and i believe we can never speak too strongly for those who cannot speak for themselves. protecting life must be our top priority. this debate is more than a simple disagreement about making choices. it is a debate about fundamental, god-given rights, the first of which, of course, is the right to life. mr. speaker, i believe that this house, the people's house, has no higher duty than to protect human life, no matter how big or how small it is or where it may be located. as we approach the 43rd anniversary of roe v. wade, i pray for all the families in our nation who have chosen life and for all the life that we have lost. ____________________
