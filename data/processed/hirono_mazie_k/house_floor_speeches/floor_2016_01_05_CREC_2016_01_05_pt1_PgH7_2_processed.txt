[congressional record volume 162, number 2 (tuesday, january 5, 2016)] [house] [page h7] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] e-free act (mr. fitzpatrick asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. fitzpatrick. mr. speaker, i rise tonight to tell the story of amanda dykeman of illinois, one of the tens of thousands of women permanently harmed by the sterilization device known as essure. after amanda had the device implanted in 2010 at the age of 28, her hair began to fall out, she felt great fatigue, continuously fought urinary tract and kidney infections, and would suffer from severe abdominal and joint pain. she suffered with so much pain that she would contemplate suicide. her symptoms subsided after a total hysterectomy in 2013, but, physically, she knows that the device left her permanently damaged. i rise as a voice for the essure sisters, who number in the thousands, to tell this chamber that their stories are real, their pain is real, and their fight is real. mr. speaker, my bill, the e-free act, can halt this tragedy by removing this dangerous device from the market. i urge my colleagues to join in this fight because stories like amanda's are too important to ignore. ____________________
