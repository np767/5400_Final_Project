[congressional record volume 162, number 3 (wednesday, january 6, 2016)] [house] [page h20] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] repeal and replace obamacare the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from illinois (mr. shimkus) for 5 minutes. mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, i have voted over 60 times to repeal or to replace all or portions of obamacare. i have voted numerous times to defund planned parenthood. these issues have always been held up by the parliamentary rules in the senate, which is the ability of a minority number of senators to block bills from coming to the floor. but not now, not today. under reconciliation procedures, a simple majority vote can move a bill out of the senate chamber. so today we will vote to repeal and replace major pieces of obamacare that distort the market, raise prices, and deprive our citizens of choice. the bill today will eliminate the individual mandate and the employer mandate. the government's forcing of our citizens to buy a product that they do not want is un-american and costly. i say good riddance. we were all aghast over the recordings that were released that highlighted planned parenthood's selling of baby body parts. as a member who believes that individual, distinct life begins at conception, planned parenthood's lack of remorse or even of concern highlights its dark business. today we send a bill to the president's desk to defund planned parenthood. many of my constituents have told me: we gave you the house majority in 2010. what have you done? we gave you the senate majority in 2014. what have you done? why cannot you get something to the president's desk? today we do. we send a bill to the president's desk that repeals obamacare and defunds planned parenthood, and it is about time. ____________________
