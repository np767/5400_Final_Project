[congressional record volume 170, number 10 (thursday, january 18, 2024)] [house] [page h192] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] celebrating the service of christine hill the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from illinois (mr. bost) for 5 minutes. mr. bost. mr. speaker, i rise today to celebrate the service of one of our staffers on the va committee. ms. christine hill has dedicated decades of her career to this nation's servicemembers, veterans, and their families. she got her start in congress as a military legislative assistant for elizabeth dole before being appointed and confirmed by the senate to serve as the va assistant secretary for congressional and legislative affairs in the bush administration. christine then went on to advocate for veterans in the vso world until we were able to bring her here to the committee where she has served as the subcommittee on health staff director for over 10 years. christine has helped advance dozens of bills supporting veterans and their families, most notably: giving veterans greater control over the healthcare that works for them through the choice and the va mission acts, expanding mental health care and support through the commander john scott hannon veterans mental health care improvement act, fighting for toxic-exposed veterans to get them the healthcare and benefits they have earned through the pact act, and so many other landmark pieces of legislation. it is important to note that she only began her impressive civilian career after a full 20-year career in the united states air force. christine's entire life is marked by service, and she, without question, represents the best that america has to offer. a graduate of the air force academy, christine held numerous positions as a kc-135 navigator, flying combat support during desert storm. christine was handpicked to become the first woman assigned to fly the b-1b bomber and concluded her military career at the pentagon, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. you would never guess any of these things about christine. she is one of the kindest, most humble people i have ever met, and she has been an absolute pleasure to work with during my time leading this committee. she is a dear friend of mine, and she will be sorely missed. mr. speaker, i thank christine. i want her to have a wonderful life in the things she pursues from here on out. this nation thanks her for the job she has done both in the military and for this institution. ____________________
