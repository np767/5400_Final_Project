[congressional record volume 162, number 3 (wednesday, january 6, 2016)] [house] [page h25] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] president's executive actions restrict second amendment rights (ms. foxx asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) ms. foxx. mr. speaker, as citizens of the united states, we are afforded basic rights and privileges under the constitution. one of these fundamental rights is the second amendment, and its guarantee to keep and bear arms is clear. yesterday, in yet another attempt to erode our basic liberties, president obama announced plans to undermine the will of congress and challenge the second amendment rights of all americans. just like his unilateral actions on immigration, this proposal is an overreach of the president's constitutionally granted executive authority. congressional refusal to pass bad policy does not transfer legislative authority to the president, and i will fight against this attempt to diminish our constitutional rights. guns are one of many tools that people use to commit horrific crimes, but the problem of evil cannot be legislated away. it is important that any legislative response, whether it is at the federal, state, or local level, ensures that the constitutional rights of all citizens are protected. ____________________
