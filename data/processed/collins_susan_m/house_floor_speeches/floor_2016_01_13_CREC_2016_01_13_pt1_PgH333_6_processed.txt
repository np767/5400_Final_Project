[congressional record volume 162, number 8 (wednesday, january 13, 2016)] [house] [page h333] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] more empty words at state of the union (ms. foxx asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) ms. foxx. mr. speaker, for the past 7 years, president obama has given us 47,625 words of meaningless rhetoric. last night's state of the union address was more of the same empty words. president obama has never adequately focused on what really matters in this country: keeping america safe and defending our cherished freedoms. instead, he wants to maintain the status quo and continues to promote top-down, one-size-fits-all federal dictates that stymie economic growth. it is clear he does not understand the solutions that will get our nation back on track with the american people, not washington bureaucrats. president obama promised hope and change, but his failed agenda has brought the wrong kind of change, and many north carolinians are losing hope. fortunately, republicans are committed to restoring confidence in america and empowering her people to make their own decisions and pursue their own dreams. ____________________
