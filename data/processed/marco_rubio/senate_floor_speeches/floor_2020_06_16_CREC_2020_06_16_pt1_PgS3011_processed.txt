[congressional record volume 166, number 111 (tuesday, june 16, 2020)] [senate] [pages s3011-s3012] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] additional statements ______ recognizing best memories academy mr. rubio. madam president, as chairman of the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship, each week i recognize a small business that exemplifies the american entrepreneurial spirit at the heart of our country. it is my privilege to recognize a woman- owned small business that provides an enriching environment for children and serves a diverse community. this week, it is my pleasure to honor best memories academy of orlando, fl, as the senate small business of the week. for 20 years, best memories academy has provided quality childcare for families in orlando, fl. when her son was 2 years old, lyana vazquez, originally from puerto rico, began searching for a daycare program that would provide instruction in english and spanish, but options were limited in the orlando area. undeterred, lyana founded best memories academy, to provide daycare and preschool programs with an emphasis on bilingual education. [[page s3012]] over the years, best memories academy has expanded its services. lyana developed a bilingual curriculum and built strong relationships with orlando's growing latino community. she hired educators who spoke english and spanish, incorporating the lena grow program into their training. this research-based program enabled staff to begin conversational language teaching during critical stages of language learning. in 2019, best memories academy began offering kindergarten and first grade instruction in addition to voluntary prekindergarten and after-school care. they partnered with the early learning coalition of orange county, elcoc, to host educational workshops and community outreach events, becoming one of the premier daycare centers in the area. like many other small businesses, best memories academy experienced a sharp decline in revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic. as student enrollment dropped, lyana modified her business operations to comply with the latest best practices from the center for disease control, florida department of health, and florida department of children and families. together, she and her team assembled and dropped remote- learning packets for students, taking special care with the materials for children whose families lacked internet access. despite the challenges, lyana was determined to stay open to care for the children of essential workers and keep her employees paid. when the u.s. small business administration launched the paycheck protection program ppp, lyana immediately applied. the ppp provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the covid-19 pandemic. nine days after she submitted an application, best memories academy received funding for a ppp loan in early april. as a result, lyana was able to keep her 12 employees paid and keep her business open until florida began to reopen and students returned. for lyana and her team, the paycheck protection program did not just provide a salary--it provided hope. best memories academy is a notable example of the role of relationship-driven small businesses in building community. i commend their work to provide high-quality bilingual education to children ranging from infancy to elementary school. congratulations to lyana and the entire team at best memories academy. i look forward to watching your continued growth and success in the orlando area. ____________________
