remembering justice antonin scalia mr. rubio. madam president, antonin scalia entered the world as the son and grandson of italian immigrants in 1936. when he unexpectedly departed this life last month, he was the patriarch of a large american family and the intellectual father of the most important legal movement in generations. between those points, he lived an extraordinarily full life that helped shaped the course of our country. =========================== note =========================== on page s1341, march 8, 2016, in the middle of the first column, the following language appears:

========================= end note ========================= by 1980, scalia had already accomplished more at the age of 44 than most can ever hope to in a lifetime. he had been a distinguished lawyer, served at the highest levels of the government, and taught at the country's best law schools. he might have continued to develop a reputation as the nation's brightest law professor and scholar, but providence had still more to ask of him. upon his election, president ronald reagan came to washington with a mission to restore a country that seemed divided and in decline. he promised to rebuild our military, revive our economy, and restore our sense of purpose. just as critical as these efforts, reagan was determined to bring new life to our founders' vision of our constitution, which provided for carefully limited government, separation of powers, and the rule of law. in accordance with that determination, reagan appointed scalia first to the critical d.c. circuit court of appeals and then to the supreme court of the united states. the three-decade judicial career that followed would establish justice scalia as one of the most influential american jurists--and one of the most consequential americans--in our nation's history. the federal judiciary that scalia joined in 1982 had, for too long, both abused and shirked its proper role. it had stripped the american people and their elected representatives of their legitimate powers by inventing brand-new ``constitutional rights'' practically out of thin air. just as troubling, it had failed to uphold the very real constitutional limits on government. the courts too often treated the text of statutes as mere suggestions and often appointed themselves as a kind of super-legislature. scalia would not stand for this. he saw this prevailing approach of judges as an abuse of power and a threat to a free and self-governing people. for scalia, the rule of law was the touchstone of liberty, and judges had an important role in upholding it. he understood that america has a written constitution for clear reasons: to restrict government and preserve liberty. as a judge, scalia insisted that the constitution be applied as written and originally understood, not freely interpreted by unelected judges. if the constitution must change, as it has needed to throughout our history, the document itself offers an amendment process. justice scalia had a sharp and well-articulated legal philosophy that put the text and meaning of the constitution and law front and center. a judge, scalia believed, must put aside his policy preferences in order to say what the law is. ``the judge who always likes the results he reaches is a bad judge,'' he said. justice scalia lived out this approach on the bench. his majority opinions established clear and well-articulated precedents. his sharp and colorful dissents brilliantly exposed moments when too many of his colleagues preferred to put policy preferences and outcomes above the constitution and the rule of law. for conservatives, the words ``scalia dissents'' always offered a silver lining--they meant that a likely damaging legal precedent would at least come prepackaged with a wonderfully readable corrective. whether he was on the majority or minority side of a decision, the forceful logic and clear phrasing of scalia's opinions commanded attention and engagement. over time, his most reliable intellectual adversaries found themselves increasingly forced to fight on the ground he established. while justice scalia did not win every argument, he changed the conversation forever. judicial activism no longer has a free hand because scalia challenged it and inspired an entire generation of legal minds to follow his example. his judicial writing alone would have changed american law and advanced the cause of liberty, but justice scalia went further than that. he wrote books, lectured, and mentored students. he traveled around the country, engaged the media, and debated colleagues and critics. his many law clerks now distinguish themselves throughout the legal profession. the federalist society, which he helped nurture in its fledgling years, now provides a lively forum for a variety of conservative and libertarian perspectives on law. antonin scalia has left us a legal culture absolutely transformed from the one he found. justice scalia's judicial opinions, legal philosophy, and forceful advocacy for the rule of law inspired me as a law student and continue to inspire me to this day. while a wide array of life experiences and values have shaped the way i see america and the world, antonin scalia has been the single most important influence on my view of the constitution and the proper role of judges in our republic as men and women who should put the original meaning of our constitution ahead of their policy preferences. justice scalia's life is a testimony to the fact that ideas matter. it is proof that a person of principle, with the willingness to invest in debate and persuasion, can change history. his life also reminds us of another important truth. particularly in these sharply divided partisan times, we can lose sight of the fact that the things that unite us are more important than the things that divide us. justice scalia never did. he knew the constitution was his sole guide in his professional life, but he was also a devout catholic who accepted that god has a plan for all of us. he took evident joy in living out his faith, in loving his family, and in nurturing countless friendships, even with his ideological foes. we should all be grateful that god's plan for our nation, especially the people whose paths he crossed, included having justice scalia on the court for the past 30 years. he was a role model for all of us and particularly for christians in public life. as a u.s. senator, i led a bipartisan group of colleagues in filing an amicus brief in the supreme court. the brief, submitted in the case of town of greece v. galloway, defended the practice of legislative prayer. it argued that the original meaning of the first amendment clearly did not require the purging of religious expression from the public square. i attended the oral argument in the case and will forever be grateful for having had the opportunity to watch justice scalia's sharp and incisive questioning from the bench. although i did not have the good fortune to get to know justice scalia personally, he had a profound impact on me. all those who cherish the constitution and limited government mourn this great loss. justice scalia was a brilliant legal mind who served with honor, distinction, and only one legal objective: to interpret and defend the constitution as written. he is a model for exactly what his successor and all future justices should strive to be on the highest court in the land. [[page s1342]] antonin scalia left us far too soon, but his legacy will remain with us as long as we remain a republic under law. =========================== note =========================== on page s1342, march 8, 2016, at the top of the first column, the following language appears: remembering justice antonin scalia . . . a republic under law. the online record has been corrected to read: . . . a republic under law. ========================= end note ========================= mrs. fischer. madam president, it is an honor to pay tribute to the late justice antonin scalia. justice scalia was a staunch defender of the constitution who, above all, sought to uphold the original meaning of its text. he steadfastly adhered to his oath of office, which directed him to ``administer justice without respect to persons, [to] do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and [to] faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all [his] duties . . . under the constitution and laws of the united states.'' in doing so, he recognized this approach to judicial interpretation might conflict with popular opinion. as justice scalia once stated: ``if you are going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you are not always going to like the conclusions you reach. if you like them all the time, you are probably doing something wrong.'' a few years ago, i had the privilege of visiting the supreme court to listen to oral arguments in the case of national labor relations board v. noel canning, which concerned the scope of the president's authority to make recess appointments. i recall being struck by justice scalia's probing questions and his ability to immediately get to the crux of an issue; yet justice scalia never lacked civility when making an argument. as he once said, ``i attack ideas. i do not attack people. and some very good people have some very bad ideas.'' justice scalia was known for more than his jurisprudence. the son of immigrants and the first italian american to serve on the supreme court, he is remembered by many for his strong belief in the american dream. a former law clerk recalled how he introduced justice scalia to his grandfather, a holocaust survivor. the clerk's grandfather was nervous to meet a member of the court, but scalia embraced the man. he said he was honored to meet a man who represented everything that made him proud to be an american. justice scalia was also a loving husband to maureen, his wife of 56 years, and the father of nine children and many grandchildren. scalia often noted that his wife deserved all the credit for their children's accomplishments. each year, the ranks of scalia alumni would grow, and he would visit with each of them and their families, even nicknaming their children as his ``grandclerks.'' justice scalia was also a man of faith and looked to the roman catholic church as a guiding force in his life. one of the justice's former law clerks recalled that scalia's faith inspired the clerk to deepen his own embrace of religion. scalia loved hunting, the opera, anchovy pizza, and red wine. he was known for taking law clerks to lunch at a.v. ristorante, an italian restaurant in washington that has since closed down. he insisted they order anchovy pizza and red wine, and he was said to be dismayed when a clerk declined one or the other. after a.v. ristorante closed, he would lead clerks in a hunt for a worthy replacement. of course, as justice breyer once noted, justice scalia ``loved nothing better than a great argument.'' although he frequently disagreed with his colleagues on the court, justice scalia formed deep bonds and friendships with his fellow justices and respected their views. as justice breyer recalled: we both would hope that the audience of students or senators would leave not with a better sense of who was right, but with a greater respect for the institution we represented. they would see that sometimes we disagreed, that we nonetheless understood and paid attention to each other's points of view, that those views were serious views, and that we were friends. and we were good friends. when justice elena kagan joined the supreme court the two became hunting buddies. a few times a year, they would go hunting together to enjoy a shared appreciation for this sport. but it was his deep friendship with justice ruth bader ginsburg that was well known to many. she stated recently: ``how blessed i was to have a friend of such brilliance, high spirits, and quick wit . . . we were different, yes, yet one in our reverence for the court and its place in the u.s. system of governance.'' justice scalia will be remembered for his brilliant legal mind and faithful dedication to the constitution. we will also remember his humor, his spirituality, his love for his family, and his ability to find common ground even in the face of disagreement. let us pray for his family and friends as we proudly celebrate his service to our country. mr. lankford. madam president, on february 13, 2016, the supreme court not only lost one of its justices, our nation lost a true legal giant. justice antonin scalia was described by his colleagues as ``extraordinary,'' ``treasured,'' and ``a stylistic genius.'' beyond his unwavering dedication to upholding the originalist viewpoint of the constitution, justice scalia was also whole-heartedly committed to his family. he was a husband, father of nine, and grandfather to 36 grandchildren. his son paul said of him during his homily that ``god blessed dad with a love for his family . . . he was the father that god gave us for the great adventure of family life . . . he loved us, and sought to show that love. and sought to share the blessing of the faith he treasured. and he gave us one another, to have each other for support. that is the greatest wealth parents can bestow, and right now we are particularly grateful for it.'' justice scalia was nominated to the united states supreme court in 1986 by president reagan and was confirmed by the senate in a unanimous vote. while his time on the court often led to criticism of his legal opinions and colorful dissents, he remained respected by his colleagues, even those at the opposite end of the judicial spectrum. this is a sign of true character--to have the ability to have an open, honest debate about a particular issue, while respecting the individual person holding an opinion different from your own. justice scalia said, ``i attack ideas. i do not attack people. and some very good people have some very bad ideas. and if you cannot separate the two, you gotta get another day job.'' this sentiment was best portrayed through his friendship with justice ginsburg. of her friend, she said, ``we are different, we are one. different in our interpretation of written texts, one in our reverence for the constitution and the institution we serve. from our years together at the d.c. circuit, we were best buddies. we disagreed now and then, but when i wrote for the court and received a scalia dissent, the opinion ultimately released was notably better than my initial circulation.'' justice scalia was known for his wit and sarcasm in his writings, famously referring to the legal interpretations of his colleagues as ``jiggery-pokery,'' ``pure applesauce,'' and ``a ghoul in a late horror movie.'' yet it was these same criticisms that justice ginsburg said nailed the weak spots in her opinions and gave her what she needed to strengthen her writings. justice scalia represented a consistent, constitutional voice on the court. just as the constitution is a pillar of our legal system, so too was his affirmation to this foundational document of our nation. he said, ``it is an enduring constitution that i want to defend...it is what did the words mean to the people who ratified the bill of rights or who ratified the constitution, as opposed to what people today would like.'' as justice kennedy said, ``in years to come any history of the supreme court will, and must, recount the wisdom, scholarship, and technical brilliance that justice scalia brought to the court. his insistence on demanding standards shaped the work of the court in its private discussions, its oral arguments, and its written opinions. yet these historic achievements are all the more impressive and compelling because the foundations of justice scalia's jurisprudence, the driving force in all his work, and his powerful personality were shaped by an unyielding commitment to the constitution of the united states and to the highest ethical and moral standards.'' ____________________
