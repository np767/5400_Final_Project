call the roll. mr. thune. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the acting president pro tempore. without objection, it is so ordered. automated vehicles mr. thune. madam president, from the beginning, the story of the u.s. auto industry has been one of ingenuity, of taking risks, and of pushing forward. at the dawn of the 20th century, most americans could hardly comprehend the idea of the automobile. yet, 20 years later, they had become nearly ubiquitous in american life, thanks to the insistence of entrepreneurs like henry ford on making the automobile affordable for the majority of americans. the democratization of the automobile, rather than the invention of the automobile itself, is, in my opinion, one of most remarkable and uniquely american success stories. automobiles allowed americans to capitalize on the economic dynamism of the roaring twenties and helped americans move and adapt during the great depression. they contributed greatly to the american industrial base and the know-how needed to fight and win the second world war and help propel the united states to its current status as a preeminent global economic and military power. visionary investments like the interstate highway system made cars a staple in american economic and cultural life. and cars certainly made it a lot easier to get to and from rural america. in a place like rural south dakota, with limited public transportation, the automobile, often a pickup or an suv, is typically the only way to get around. today, the automobile industry stands on the brink of a new technological revolution, which promises to dramatically transform mobility once again. over the past three decades, the internet has transformed our economy and our way of life, and the next generation of the internet, 5g, which is currently being deployed across the nation, will enable a host of new innovations, including a revolution in vehicle technology: automated vehicles or what we call avs. avs will change the way that we move in numerous ways, making the transportation system safer, more efficient, and more accessible. individuals whose mobility is currently limited, for example, americans with disabilities, could gain new independence with the deployment of automated vehicles, allowing them to work or visit friends and family safely and easily. i am proud that my proposed av amendment to the endless frontier act was recently endorsed by the national federation of the blind, and i ask for unanimous consent that the letter of endorsement be inserted in the record there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: national federation of the blind, may 11, 2021. hon. maria cantwell, chair, u.s. senate committee on commerce, science, & transportation, washington, dc. hon. roger wicker, ranking member, u.s. senate committee on commerce, science, & transportation, washington, dc. dear chair cantwell and ranking member wicker: the national federation of the blind, the nation's transformative civil rights organization of the blind, supports and endorses the amendment to the endless frontier act filed with the committee by senator thune on may 10, 2021. specifically, we support the portions of the amendment that will create an exemption classification for manufacturers who provide transportation access for people with disabilities and prohibit discriminatory licensing practices for highly automated vehicles. subsection (d)(2)(c) of the amendment would create an exemption category under the federal motor vehicle safety standards located in section 30113 of title 49 united states code that would ``provide transportation access for individuals with disabilities, including non-visual access for individuals who are blind or visually impaired.'' this addition to the law will provide the incentive needed for automobile manufacturers to ensure that the unique requirements for americans with disabilities to be able to operate automated vehicles are considered in the early stages of development. subsection (e)(3) of the amendment would mandate that a state ``may not issue a motor vehicle operator's license for the operation or use of a highly automated vehicle in a manner that discriminates on the basis of disability.'' this will ensure that current requirements necessary to obtain a driver's license, like a vision test, will not be required in order to operate or use a highly automated vehicle. we are pleased to see this subsection included in the amendment because highly automated vehicles will pilot themselves (sae level 4 and level 5), making a vision requirement arbitrary and discriminatory. highly automated vehicles have the potential to revolutionize the transportation landscape, especially for individuals with disabilities. however, those same individuals with disabilities who stand to gain the most from the creation and proliferation of highly automated vehicles could be left out of this new frontier if specific actions are not taken. senator thune's amendment to the endless frontier act is an important step to ensure that america's journey toward automotive automation is fully inclusive of those who will benefit most. sincerely, mark a. riccobono, president. mr. thune. madam president, imagine a farmer in rural south dakota who can no longer drive to get to town for appointments, prescriptions, or groceries--enter the automated vehicle. this technology has potential to keep people in their homes and communities longer. moreover, avs have potential to greatly increase roadway safety. currently, there are an average of more than 35,000 traffic fatalities on our nation's roadways each year, including pedestrian, motorcycle, and bicycle fatalities. automated vehicles could dramatically-- dramatically--reduce that number. distracted driving, driving while impaired--automated vehicles could eliminate those dangers. for automated vehicle technology to advance, it is imperative that the regulatory framework catch up with private-sector innovation. that is why i have pushed for the enactment of av legislation over the years and why i had hoped--i had hoped--that we would be voting to add my automated vehicles amendment to the legislation before the senate today. i have spent nearly 5 years--5 years--working in a bipartisan manner on a legislative framework to govern the testing and deployment of automated vehicles. the amendment i offered to the bill before us today is an amendment that i had hoped to be able to offer with bipartisan support. it would have paved the way for expanded testing and deployment of automated vehicles in the united states under the oversight of the national highway traffic safety administration. and let me emphasize that oversight point. my amendment would ensure that automated vehicles would not--not--touch pavement without the national highway traffic safety administration's certification that they are at least as safe as a conventional vehicle. the data gathered from the vehicles deployed as a result of this amendment would be crucial to the development of future motor vehicle safety standards for avs. unfortunately, bipartisan agreement on my amendment collapsed when special interests expressed their opposition, despite major efforts to accommodate their concerns. and i am deeply disappointed that, once again, democrats yielded to pressure from special interests against the best interests of our economy and the american people. advancing av technology is not just a vehicle safety issue. it is also an issue of u.s. leadership and global competitiveness. investing in the production of av technology here in the united states would not only strengthen the resilience of the auto industry but also the nation's industrial base and our national security. the auto industry touches nearly every american state. for example, horton in britton, sd, manufactures engine cooling systems, providing steady, good paying jobs for that community and strengthening the local economy. the same story repeats itself countless times in communities all across the nation. providing millions of jobs and investing billions annually, the american auto industry is a critical component of the nation's economy. right now, [[page s3551]] u.s. companies lead the world in av technology, but other nations, like china, are seizing upon regulatory inaction and striving to take the lead. if we do not move forward with automated vehicle technology, we will soon see some other nation leading the av revolution. the legislative package before us today is designed to bolster the global competitiveness of the united states. it is pretty difficult to understand why this reasonable and, i might add, no cost av amendment that would lead to untold benefits for our nation's transportation system, does not fit in. how can a bill making strong investments in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing exclude a legislative framework for avs? are we really going to back down from leading the world in automated innovation and technology and cede the future of this industry to nations like china? will we really ignore the enormous--enormous-- safety benefits of these vehicles just to suit democrats' political convenience? more than a century ago, when the automobile was invented, there were plenty of skeptics, but america's automobile pioneers did not let that stop them. they seized the moment and pressed forward and ushered in a transportation revolution. we can do that again today or we can cede this moment to nations like china and let the american automobile industry fall permanently behind. that is the choice in front of us. i hope we will choose to seize this moment and pass the legislation we need to usher in another american transportation revolution. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the acting president pro tempore. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. the presiding officer (mr. schatz).

(a) findings.--congress makes the following findings: (1) the united states had led the formation, as well as reform, of rules governing the multilateral trading system since world war ii. (2) the united states is a founding member of the world trade organization (in this section referred to as the ``wto'') and a key architect of the organization. (3) the united states secured important commitments in the wto to facilitate trade in goods and services, to prevent the application of non-scientific restrictions on united states agriculture, and to protect united states intellectual property. (4) the united states uses the rules of the wto to benefit workers, farmers, fishers, and businesses in the united states by facilitating access to the 90 percent of the world's consumers who live outside the borders of the united states. (5) the fundamental purpose of the wto is to create space for members to negotiate with each other, and the wto reserves to those members exclusively the right to negotiate and adopt rules that reduce and eliminate trade barriers and discriminatory treatment. (6) the prompt settlement of disputes in which a member of the wto considers that its rights are being impaired by the actions of another member is essential to the functioning of the wto and the maintenance of [[page s3570]] a proper balance between the rights and obligations of members. (7) the wto's dispute settlement function, including in particular the appellate body, has increasingly failed to enforce the rules of the wto in a timely manner, and has usurped the negotiating prerogative of members by creating new obligations and rights that are inconsistent with or not included in the rules negotiated by members. (8) the creation of those obligations and rights undermines-- (a) the wto's negotiating function by discouraging members from making concessions; and (b) the wto's dispute settlement function by encouraging overuse of the process and undermining its legitimacy, including by preventing free market economies from responding to globally trade distortive practices by nonmarket economies. (9) the wto does not have sufficient rules to discipline the distortive economic policies of nonmarket economies, such as policies relating to excess capacity and forced technology transfer, the special treatment those economies afford to state-owned enterprises, and their massive and opaque industrial subsidies. (10) there is long-standing bipartisan support in congress to reform the wto to address those failings. (11) the current presidential administration, as well as prior administrations, raised concerns about the failings described in this subsection and have made reform of the wto a top priority of united states trade policy. (12) the united states urges wto members to work constructively with the united states to assess the reasons why the existing wto rules have proven inadequate in order to create an atmosphere within the wto that is conducive to the development of new rules less subject to jurisprudential drift. (13) the guiding principle for reform of the wto, and the lens through which wto members should consider specific reform proposals, is the restoration of the wto's capability and capacity for negotiation among members. (14) the united states has achieved its trade policy objectives through active leadership at the wto, and an absence of that leadership would be filled by nonmarket economies that are hostile to a host of united states interests. (b) sense of congress.--it is the sense of congress that-- (1) while the united states finds value and usefulness in the wto, in order to fulfill the needs of the united states and other free and open economies in the 21st century, significant reforms are needed; (2) the united states must therefore continue to demonstrate leadership to achieve reforms that restore the effectiveness of the wto's-- (a) negotiating function; (b) dispute settlement function so that it transparently, efficiently, and fully enforces outcomes negotiated by members rather than usurping their primacy by creating new rights or obligations; and (c) rules for special and differential treatment to ensure those rules promote advancement for truly developing countries, rather than becoming tools for globally competitive countries, like the people's republic of china, to engage in protectionism and market distortions; (3) the efforts to reform the negotiating function of the wto should revitalize the negotiating function by providing confidence to members that the wto operates according to the rules as negotiated and adopted by members; (4) a revitalized negotiating function must include new rules that reflect the 21st century economy, further combat anticompetitive and protectionist barriers, and ensure disputes are efficiently resolved; (5) the united states trade representative should continue to lead efforts to work with wto members to pursue reforms at the wto that-- (a) ensure the dispute settlement mechanism faithfully applies the rules adopted by members, including by undertaking measures to ensure the wto's appellate body does not create new rights and obligations; (b) improve public confidence in dispute settlement by promoting greater transparency and efficiency in the conduct of proceedings; (c) redress the consistent failure by certain members to satisfy their notification obligations under various wto agreements, including through measures that strengthen accountability; (d) ensure rules for special and differential treatment are appropriately reserved for countries whose state of development and global competitiveness actually warrants such flexibility; (e) create new rules and structures that can serve the interests of the united states while promoting peace, prosperity, good governance, transparency, effective operation of legal regimes, the rule of law, and free enterprise; and (f) expand upon the trilateral negotiations currently underway with japan and the european union; and (6) the united states trade representative should explore and assess specific reform proposals, including-- (a) pursuing plurilateral agreements that further the interests of the united states while limiting the benefits accruing to countries that are not parties to those agreements; (b) efforts to ensure that incorrect interpretations by the appellate body, including with respect to the agreement on safeguards, the agreement on implementation of article vi of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994, and the agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures, are corrected, and not to be deemed precedential; (c) new rules and norms to address practices of nonmarket economies, such as practices relating to state-owned enterprises, which certain countries often utilize for objectives that cause severe trade distortions; and (d) better implementation of existing rules, such as the prohibition in paragraph 4 of article xiv of the general agreement on tariffs and trade on currency manipulation, to ensure that those rules are effective to preserve the rights of free market economies. title iv--promoting american competitiveness subtitle a--reauthorization and reform of generalized system of preferences sec. 74001. modification of eligibility criteria for beneficiary developing countries.

bipartisanship that can be achieved if we put in the hard work to work out the details and the differences between us on very critical issues. this is not just an amendment on one topic; this is an entire title, the finance committee's title. the chairman of the finance committee, senator wyden, and i have worked for months [[page s3837]] together to identify that intersection--which is a big one, as you will see--between republicans and democrats here in the senate on trade policy to help us to put together a package of strong trade policy that will help us to stand up our efforts in pushing back against china in one of the most critical arenas that we face: trade, our economy, and working against the very nefarious activities that china is engaged in to try to undercut us economically and to undercut our american companies in our trade relationships. senator wyden and i worked hard together to get this done, and i am glad that we now have a package that can be put forward. as i said, it is not just one provision; this is an entire trade title. let me summarize just some of the things that are in it. it provides a comprehensive approach to combat china's manufacturing imbalances, threats to free and fair trade, and illicit activity, which undermine america's leadership in innovation. this legislation will level the playing field for american consumers and companies, including workers, farmers, fishers, families, and taking aim at china's worst practices. the amendment itself carries a bipartisan approach into a senate-wide effort to ensure that the united states is positioned effectively to compete on a fair playing field globally--not just with china, globally, but especially with china. it bolsters efforts to prohibit goods made with forced labor from reaching the united states by strengthening our customs and border protection enforcement efforts and through better use of the seafood import monitoring program. it provides modernized trade enforcement tools to u.s. trade representatives to address anti-competitive digital trade and censorship practices, like china's great firewall, by requiring the ustr to identify trading partners that disrupt digital trade. it appoints a ustr official to oversee information communication technology and provides advance notice and text of proposals for any digital trade agreements 5 days before they are tabled to facilitate our efforts here in congress to oversee an effective trade policy. it requires a review of trade in essential supplies, including the sources of imports, and analysis of any vulnerabilities, as well as additional tools for businesses in the united states seeking reliable suppliers. it strengthens oversight over u.s. trade policy by providing an inspector general to the ustr and by ensuring the application of section 301 tariffs related to china are calibrated to provide the necessary leverage to support american competition while ensuring u.s. competitiveness in manufacturing. it reauthorizes, critically, the miscellaneous tariff bill--what has been called the mtb--and improved generalized system of preferences, the gsp. that will promote human rights, the environment, women's economic empowerment, and the rule of law and digital trade, and restarts and reforms the critical section 301 product exclusion process. these things might sound complicated, but it is our way of standing up our american competitors in a very anti-competitive environment dealing with china. it expands the duties of the interagency center on trade implementation, monitoring, and enforcement to include investigations of practices, diffuse impacts on the economy and workers of the united states where there is systemic impacts on the resiliency of multiple critical domestic supply chains. standing up and building out our supply chains is critical in this economic competition. it requires the u.s. trade representatives to initiate talks with the quad countries to develop a strategy on critical minerals to counter china's dominant share of that global supply. it requires the cbp to submit a report to congress on achieving supply chain transparency. cbp is seeking greater supply chain transparency to address merchandise made with forced labor, with counterfeits, and through a 21st century customs framework initiative. it requires the ustr to brief congress on the findings of a forthcoming report by the comptroller general of the united states related to that critical 301 exclusion process. it directs the ustr to enter into negotiations with allies to stop the importation of goods made with stolen intellectual property into the united states and allied countries. the theft of american intellectual property is becoming critical to our ability to be effectively competitive against china. this list goes on. this is a major finance committee title that will significantly strengthen u.s. competitiveness in response to the malign activities that we continuously see growing from china. i encourage all of my colleagues to support this important amendment. before i finish, i want to say what i was going to say at the beginning of my remarks, and i alluded to it briefly. senator wyden and i have had a very close and strong negotiation going on, and i appreciate deeply the ability that we have to work together in a bipartisan fashion to build this, and we will be building other very important policies for this country. i just wanted to thank my colleague senator wyden for his partnership in this effort. the presiding officer. the senator from oregon. mr. wyden. madam president, i, too, want to express my appreciation to senator crapo. we are partners in the senate finance committee. as senator crapo really touched on, we know that sometimes around here in the senate, it is hard to get senators to agree on the proper way to butter a piece of toast. but what senator crapo and i have tried to show--and i believe this amendment does it--is that the senate is going to come together on the urgency of outcompeting china, and that is what our legislation is all about. senator crapo ticked off a number of the key measures. obviously we feel very strongly. we spent weeks looking at it in hearings and in discussions--at how china rips off our intellectual properties, steals technology, sends dangerous counterfeits to our market, and how it undercuts manufacturers with overproduction and unfair subsidies. the fact is, the chinese have deployed massive subsidies, incentivized overproduction in key manufacturing sectors like steel, aluminum, and solar panels, that undercuts our competitors. they have shaken down american firms for intellectual property and stolen cutting-edge technology. worst of all, colleagues, is the practice of forced labor, which we looked at in the senate finance committee. it is morally repugnant on its own, and it is also a very substantial threat to american jobs. i do want to spend a moment on an area where we are going to be doing a lot more work, and i am going to have plenty to say about it before this bill becomes law; and that is, as my friend from idaho just talked about, the chinese government's great firewall. it blocks more than 10,000 american websites and digital platforms, and others are subjected to extreme censorship. americans who are blocked can only watch as chinese homegrown competitors then rip off their very best ideas, thrive in the absence of real competition, and then grow into tech behemoths themselves. the catch is, as those chinese-grown tech giants get bigger and bigger, using ripped-off american tech and ideas, they are also exporting their government's intolerance of free speech. so in the case of the great firewall, we now have trade enforcement tools that really go back to the dark ages. literally, some of them date back to some cases in the middle of the last century, and that, in no way, leaves us in a good position. as senator crapo and i have found--and we agreed in a bipartisan manner on this--it leaves us ill-prepared to handle the fast-moving world of digital trade, where there are a lot of high-skill, high-wage jobs on the line. so, for now, i hope members of the senate will strongly support this bipartisan amendment. as senator crapo said, we have a lot of other things we are going to tackle. as the presiding officer knows, i think what we talked about yesterday, in terms of clean energy, can build on ideas of both political parties. senator crapo has a very good idea for tech-neutral, private sector competition for clean energy. that is his idea. i am a democrat, and i am acknowledging my colleague's good ideas. so we have a lot to work with. [[page s3838]] but for today, when we pass this amendment, the crapo-wyden amendment, we are signaling that the entire senate is coming together on a straightforward proposition, that we want to tell our constituents that we understand the urgency of outcompeting china, and that it is going to take key tools, which is what we have developed in the senate finance committee. i urge all senators to vote for this bipartisan amendment. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from florida amendment no. 1802 mr. rubio. madam president, i want to take a moment to speak on my amendment, and i will not take very long. first of all, really, my comments are geared toward somebody who might be watching or will maybe watch a video of this later because usually there are not a lot of mysteries here on the floor of senate. and when these amendments come up, everybody kind of knows the way it is going to go. and this amendment that i am about to put forward here is probably not going to pass. i am pretty certain it will not or we would not have gotten a vote on it. that is just the way it is. but that is ok because--it is not ok, but it is ok in the sense that i still want to take this opportunity to talk about this and have a vote on it. let me just say this: if you go back 2, 3 years, i believe not the first but one of the first people here who talked about the need to do what much of this bill does was me. i have been talking now for 2 or 3 years about the need for the american government to step forward and partner with the private sector. i have been talking about the need for industrial policy. you cannot compete with a nation-state if the nation-state is not involved in the competition. and that is what we are involved in--a nation-state competition. and it does involve a massive amount of chinese investment in research and development. and we have to step up to the plate. the days of believing that on some of these items the private market on its own will solve it, it is not possible at this scale and scope. i point to operation warp speed. would the private market have eventually given us a vaccine? it would have. but we needed it now. we stepped forward. we provided the money. the private sector responded. and today we are standing around here with no masks on, and much of the country is getting back to normal because we have vaccines. you could criticize a lot of things about what america did in the beginning of the pandemic, but we have done vaccines better than anyone in the world, and that would not have been possible without industrial policy, which is the partnership of government and business to solve an urgent crisis of a national concern. well, when it comes to research, development, technology, that is perhaps the single greatest requirement before us today in terms of the future. the 21st century is going to be defined by this definition between china--this competition between china and the united states. and it is a competition we simply cannot win unless we step forward and match it. but another part of the chinese approach to this is not simply to invest but to steal. as many of you know, i have been on the intelligence committee now for 10 years. i was acting chairman of it for a number of months and now the vice chairman in a committee that i think--maybe i am prejudiced in this view, but i think it is the best functioning committee here. i am sure some would disagree. but i think we do a lot of good work. and it comes on topic--and i spend a lot of time reading all of the intelligence every single day. let me just describe my experiences over the last few years. it is a horror show. the chinese are stealing our intellectual property. and it is not just, oh, they reverse engineered someone's software; they steal the money the taxpayers are investing in basic research and development. we have a graph here. i have it up. the print is too small to see on camera, but i will describe it to you. here is how they operate, use our universities. they prioritize--they steal priority technologies, leverage international openness of u.s. markets, universities, and institutes. they play scientists, researchers in universities, u.s. national labs, for access to emerging and foundational research and access to dual-use export control technologies. it goes on to say, chinese state-owned enterprises' front and shell companies partner with universities for access to ip, research data, technology, penetrate u.s. company supply chains. this is their strategy. now, we were about to put $200 billion of american taxpayer money in more of that, in more of those activities. and you do not think that they are going to do all of that against us? they are. and so it is incumbent upon us to make sure that we have in place safeguards so they cannot keep doing this to us. what is the point of putting up $200 billion of american public taxpayer money on pursuing all of this research if we are going to allow the chinese to steal it? nobody here wants them to steal it. and i know there have been improvements done in terms of upping the security. what i want you to understand is that this is not a minor security threat. this is the no. 1 priority of chinese intelligence. this is their no. 1 priority. this is what all of their agencies and all of their government is geared toward doing. and we are going to put all this money in there and hope that the safeguards we put in place are going to work. i hope they do. but what if they do not? what if a year from now we find out, or you are going to read in an article 2 years from now, whatever, that says: the chinese have stolen a quarter--25, 30 percent of the ip developed by the money that has been put forward in the bill that was passed? then we are all going to feel pretty stupid around here. that is the only thing i am aiming at. all i am asking in this amendment is that, at least in the initial stages of this program, that the director of national intelligence, the dni, the dni's office, and the fbi have an opportunity to review these grants to ensure that they do not have embedded, in the place we are giving the money to, a scientist, a researcher at one of these national labs or that there is not some shell company involved. now, i know the argument. i have heard the argument against it from those who want to do the research. this is going to slow it down. it is. tsa slows down our ability to get on airplanes. who wants to get rid of tsa? cyber security slows down our ability to access our networks. but we need more of it, not less. yes, security becomes burdensome. it slows things down. but i would rather do it slow or slower and own it than faster and have them steal it. and that is what this amendment does. i do not know what the opposition to it is other than i understand that there are a lot who just want to get their hands on this money, and they want to get going very quickly. that is what they want to do, and that is great. that is what researchers want to do. they want to move fast. we need them to move fast. but our job is different. our job is to see the problem holistically and understand, let us move as fast as we can without allowing the chinese to steal it so, look, i am asking everyone to vote against this motion to table because, frankly, i think we expose ourselves to a vulnerability. we are placing the faith that this existing system we have, and whatever new one we are starting up, is going to be able to withstand the force of the intelligence agencies of an entire nation-state and their no. 1 objective, and that is how can we get our hands on whatever these $200 billion are helping to innovate. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. ms. cantwell. madam president, speaking against this amendment, i know the senator from florida probably, given his intelligence work, wants to be well-meaning, but this amendment is not ready for the focus that we need to give on issues of counterintelligence. this amendment, as drafted, literally says that the director of national intelligence should look at and certify whether any of the entities given this money--including nasa, which would be given money under this bill--that they would have to certify for a 10-year period of time. [[page s3839]] so, literally, every institution, every organization that gets money under this bill would have to certify for a 10-year period of time that they did not have anything to do with a chinese investment. i am all for investigating theft and intellectual property. in fact, the senator from mississippi and i added several provisions to our legislation. other people have added things to this legislation. but do i want the director of national intelligence calling every university in the united states that might get money from this program and asking them to verify for the last 10 years what did they ever take as far as chinese investment? i have news for you. i want the director of national intelligence to be focusing on cyber security. if somebody did not see, we have just had a major pipeline incident. it is not the first incident; it is many incidents in which foreign governments have threatened our nation, our sources of power, basically, by infiltrating our system. i want the director of national intelligence to focus on iran, to focus on russia, to focus on north korea, to focus on syria, to focus on threats of terrorism. i want them to focus on monitoring our organizations nationwide. i do not want them spending their time calling university presidents and nasa officials asking them what they have done for the last 10 years and to verify before they can get the needed research dollars. now, i know the senator is trying to be well-meaning, and i am happy to work with him on this issue. but i know this: the race is on in semiconductors. the race is on in quantum computing. the race is on in ai. the race is on in other areas of manufacturing. and we cannot afford to have our director of national intelligence spending his time calling up these people when we have already implemented the securities in this legislation. i am happy to keep working with anybody on this issue. but, by god, i am telling you, we are going to be committed to doing more on our international threats on cyber security because, as you can see from this recent pipeline incident, that is where we should be spending our time and our focus, from a security perspective. i ask my colleagues to table the rubio amendment. motion to table madam president, i ask for the regular order. and i ask to table the rubio amendment no. 1802 and ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second?

[[page s3840]] a 29-year-old jewish man was punched, kicked, and pepper-sprayed last week in new york in broad daylight, as a group of men yelled anti- semitic statements. people in cars began throwing bottles and yelling anti-semitic slurs, including words like ``dirty jew,'' at a dinner party in los angeles. in skokie, il, someone shattered a window at a synagogue. in bal harbour, fl, men yelled, ``die jew,'' at a man in a skull cap, and then threatened to rape his wife and daughter. these instances are compounded by an uptick in anti-semitic speech online, with the anti-defamation league finding 17,000 tweets between may 7 and may 14--1 week--with some variation of the phrase: ``hitler was right.'' these attacks follow the january 6 capitol insurrection earlier this year, where white supremacist and extremist groups displayed anti- semitic and racist symbols and recited conspiracy theories blaming jews for the pandemic. these conspiracy theories have proliferated alongside anti-semitic stereotypes and images being mainstreamed by some political leaders and public figures. while these events are shocking, perhaps we should not be surprised. the adl global index on anti-semitism, updated in 2019, found that more than 1 billion people--nearly 1 in 8--around the world harbor anti- semitic attitudes. over 30 percent of those surveyed said it was ``probably true'' that jews have too much control over financial markets; that jews think they are better than other people; that jews are disloyal to their country; and that people hate jews because of the way jews behave. a full 41 percent think jews are more loyal to israel than the country they live in. such sentiments too often translate into violence, leaving 40 percent of european jews to report in 2018 that they live in daily fear of being physically attacked. here at home, jews make up fewer than 3 percent of the american population, but the majority of reported religious-based hate crimes targeted jewish people and institutions. i strongly agree with adl's ceo jonathan greenblatt, who said last week: [w]e are witnessing a dangerous and drastic surge in anti- jewish hate. . . . to those who choose to indulge in age-old antisemitic tropes, exaggerated claims and inflammatory rhetoric, it has consequences: attacks in real life on real people targeted for no other reason than they are jewish. this is antisemitism, plain and simple. and it is indisputably inexcusable in any context. in 2004, i had the opportunity to represent america at the berlin conference on anti-semitism, where we developed an action plan to stand up against anti-semitism. the very first recommendation coming out of the berlin conference is that leaders must speak out against anti- semitism in any form; that leaders need to be heard. they cannot be silent. so i was very pleased when our president, joe biden, stated this past week: the recent attacks on the jewish community are despicable, and they must stop. i condemn this hateful behavior at home and abroad--it is up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor. thank you, president biden. i was proud of our colleague senator mazie hirono, a leader in the asian-american community, who posted on social media: i have said it before and i will say it again--an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. we all must condemn the recent surge of antisemitic attacks in our country. each of us needs to stand up, speak out, and confront this hatred. at my last in-person osce meeting before covid-19, i hosted an event with my european colleagues entitled ``lessons from the past, leadership for the future,'' where we spoke about the lessons from the holocaust, including early warning signs from the past--some of which have been rising to the surface again. these early warning signs include the rise of populist leaders, demonizing of minorities, propagandizing of hate, and the neglect of refugee protections, which ultimately became the factors that resulted in genocide. this month, i chaired a helsinki commission hearing on preventing mass atrocities with professor timothy snyder and the u.s. holocaust memorial museum's center for the prevention of genocide director, naomi kikoler. this center's early warning project provides an innovative risk assessment tool using quantitative and qualitative methods to spotlight countries where mass atrocities have not begun, but where the risk of such violence is high. the warning signs are there. my colleagues, we are painfully reminded of our past. the osce has repeatedly reaffirmed that hate crimes pose a threat to the security of individuals and society, given their potential to lead to conflict and violence on a wider scale. the spread of hateful ideology and recent acts of hate crimes and extremism across the osce region attest to this. in response, i have called for a plan of action to address violence and discrimination across the osce region, including here in the united states, so that we may have a more strategic and cross-border approach to addressing hate. i have also supported the osce initiatives that address security concerns of jewish communities, including by improving relationships between law enforcement and justice institutions and vulnerable communities, educating communities on anti-semitism and how to counter it, and building alliances with other communities to counter hate. over the past decade, i have also worked to ensure that the state department's budget annually includes funding to fight anti-semitism globally by creating civil society partnerships between the united states and europe to work as allies to fight against anti-semitism, racism, xenophobia, anti-muslim bigotry, hostility to the lgbtq-plus community, and other forms of hate. the united states should be a global leader in fighting such intolerance. it would be hypocritical for us as a nation to preach to the world against hate if we let it fester and grow here at home. like a virus, as we all know too well, if hate exists in one country, it has the capacity to spread around the world. therefore, i ask all my senate colleagues to join me in supporting these efforts at home and abroad to achieve safe and just societies for all. hate takes many forms, but none of them should be acceptable here in the united states of america or anywhere else in the world. with that, i yield the floor i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. young. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. s. 1260 mr. young. mr. president, i am very proud of where the senate is headed today. it has taken well over a year-and-a-half for this bill to finally come together, to come to fruition. there have been many committees of jurisdiction that actively participated in this process, members who have accommodated other members, and i am proud of the work product that we have been developing here. i especially want to thank, as we head toward what i hope is final passage later on this evening, my legislative director, lauren o'brien; my national security adviser, brandt anderson; dan cheever, who worked on commerce committee, all manner of work for me. they have worked tirelessly with senator schumer's staff and my colleagues on the republican side to ensure that this day came about, and we got a positive outcome. let me say a bit about this legislation. we americans have always looked toward the frontier and forward to new horizons. our ancestors chased them across a continent and to the sea. when the wilderness was no more, they followed them elsewhere--in workshops and laboratories and factories and on farms, in the air and beyond. our spirit is restless. we prefer the difficult as americans. we have never accepted limits or impossibilities in life. no, instead, we sought to cure disease to lift the human condition, to better understand the world around us, to constantly go faster and further in these and other endeavors. and we do these things always aware that the new knowledge that they bring will benefit mankind and make our union stronger. but this spirit is not entirely ours alone. you see, there are others out there who also harbor bold ambitions, but they do not share our democratic [[page s3841]] values. just days ago, communist china orbited, landed, and deployed a rover on the surface of mars. no other nation has done this. no other nation has done this. it was their first voyage to the red planet. it is only part of the chinese communist party's ambitious space program. and it is another direct challenge to the united states of america. now, this momentous event happens at a time when so many of our citizens feel overlooked, when the communities they call home are hollowing out, when trust in our civic institutions is eroding, and when our allegiance seems increasingly to our political tribes and not to one another as citizens for the common good. let us not kid ourselves. the chinese communist party plans to exploit our difficulties and divisions. their power and their capabilities are growing. they are, indeed, locked in a global competition with this great nation, and they intend to win it. they intend to win it. they think of those of us in this chamber as powerless to stop them and unable to prioritize our nation's long-term goals over our party's short-term gains. so i ask you this: when future generations of americans cast their gaze toward new frontiers, will they see a red flag planted on those new frontiers that is not our own? today, we answer, unequivocally, no. today, we declare our intention to win this century and those that follow it as well. today, we demonstrate our faith in the american people to lead the way and vote to give them the tools to do so. this bill, this moment, is really not about beating china. it is really not about beating china. you see, the endless frontier act is about using their challenge to become a better version of ourselves. it is about helping more americans get more skin in the game, deploying their talents and untapped potential. it is about supercharging our economy as we emerge from this global pandemic which descended upon us from communist china. it is about spreading the benefits of this economy far and wide and preparing and allowing more people, regardless of their circumstances or their place of birth, to meaningfully participate in the 21st century. it is about unleashing what emma lazarus called the imprisoned lightning across this land and aiding so many americans in their pursuit of our common happiness. you see this is how we unite our nation and tilt the balance of a great power struggle westward. this is how we become the first to reach the next great horizon. let history record that at this moment we stood united. we declared with solemn purpose and single voice that this is our destination; that by confronting the challenges of today, we built a brighter tomorrow; and that a new generation of doers and dreamers pressed america on, once again, toward the endless frontier. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from connecticut is recognized. jabara-heyer no hate act mr. blumenthal. i was tremendously proud and grateful to be at the bill signing last week in the east room of the white house with the president of the united states, at his side when he put his approval on a measure that took years to pass, the no hate act--known as the jabara-heyer no hate act, named after khalid jabara and heather heyer, who perished as a result of the most vicious and vile hate crimes in this nation's history. the occasion was centered on legislation addressing protection for asian americans and pacific islanders. it was a tremendously moving and powerful event when the president spoke passionately and unequivocally that hate has no safe harbor in the united states. i was reminded of those moments with the president of the united states as i witnessed just very recently this surge in anti-semitic hate crimes across this country. we have seen them again and again and again. the anti-defamation league has been tracking anti-semitic incidents in the country since 1979, and the past three annual reports have included two of its highest tallies. last year's report recorded more than 1,200 incidents--a 10-percent increase from the previous year. these assaults and insults, brawls, and vicious desecrations have occurred across the country to individuals in synagogues and places of worship, and we should be rising to condemn them now unequivocally and clearly, condemn all of these acts of hate, because we are all in this perilous time together. we know from the acts of hatred directed against asian americans that they follow similar kinds of assaults and incidents involving muslim americans, black americans, and jewish americans. an assault on one is an assault on all of us. but the assaults and the acts of hatred against jewish americans have been particularly vile and venomous over these last 2, 4 weeks and months. we have seen not only the physical attacks but also holocaust denial and distortion, including intentional efforts to excuse or minimize the impact of the holocaust. these kinds of vicious and intolerable statements have grown. that is one reason why i continue to support the never again education act, which was signed into law almost 1 year ago, to expand the united states holocaust museum education programming and the development and dissemination of accurate, relevant, and accessible resources to improve awareness and understanding of the holocaust. but prevention through education is not enough. we must do more. we must act. what is most important to remember about every one of these incidents is that they involve real people, real communities, and real victims whose lives are torn apart in the most heartbreaking cases. they involve real lives that are lost forever and real families who will never see their loved ones again. that is what happened to the families of khalid jabara and heather heyer. they were in the east room of the white house with us, graciously and generously lending their presence, their faces, and their voices to this effort against hate crime. they expressed gratitude for the actions we are taking. now we must move forward to provide the funding for the no hate act so we have greater reporting of these vicious acts and so that we have better training and more prevention and action--not just condemnation but action against anti-semitism in this country. i read recently that a 5-year-old was constructing a lego of a synagogue and, using those legos, added a security force around the synagogue. what kind of america is it that requires a 5-year-old building a place of worship out of legos to include a police security guard? and what kind of america is it that has double the number of reported anti-semitic harassment, vandalism, and violence just over a 2-week period most recently when there were clashes in israel and gaza? it is not the america we know and love, and it is not the america we deserve. we must do better, and i know my colleagues share this view. i heard and saw my friend and colleague senator cardin speak powerfully on this issue just moments ago. we know that we as a body can take action because hate is contagious, but so is courage. we must provide all of the people who have courage and good will in this country with the kind of support that we can, that we must, and that we will to fight anti- semitism and to make sure that this america is the one that we know and love and that my father came to believe in as an immigrant at the age of 17 when he escaped persecution in germany, coming here at 17 years old in 1935 with not much more than the shirt on his back, knowing no one, speaking virtually no english, but believing in that america that would provide him freedom and opportunity and, yes, protection against exactly the kind of anti-semitism whose beginnings are in those kinds of vile and vicious assaults and words we see around the world today. let us all come together and fight anti-semitism just as we have done with the hate crimes against our brother and sister asian americans and make sure that our country is the one that we know and love. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from new york unanimous consent request--s. 1520 mrs. gillibrand. mr. president, i rise today to once again ask that every senator have a chance to consider and cast their vote on the military justice [[page s3842]] improvement and increasing prevention act. this bill would ensure that when crimes are committed in our military, justice is delivered. this commonsense reform, which has bipartisan, filibuster-proof support, moves the decision on whether to prosecute serious crimes to independent, trained, and professional military prosecutors, while leaving misdemeanors and uniquely military crimes within the chain of command. in other words, it takes the same approach to criminal justice that the military takes in most other areas of operation. it puts highly technical work in the hands of trained specialists. this is not a new concept. i first introduced a similar form of this legislation in 2013. this is not a new idea that requires hypothetical thinking. this system or a version of it is already being used by our allies around the world to positive effect. australia has moved charging decisions for serious crimes from the chain of command to the director of military prosecutions, as has canada, new zealand, and ireland. in france, charging decisions are made by lawyers, not by commanders. germany tries military cases in civilian courts with civilian authorities. in italy, charging decisions are made by judge advocates, who are fully independent of the chain of command. the netherlands assigns charging decisions to public prosecutors with broad experience in military cases. norway uses military prosecuting authority for criminal offenses by military personnel. the uk moved serious crimes out of the chain of command in 2009 as part of an effort to provide an independent and impartial tribunal to the accused. in israel, charging decisions are made by judge advocates whose sole commander is the military advocate general, a general officer. i will note that the israeli system is almost identical to the procedures set forth in our bill. israel has not seen a decrease in good order and discipline and, in fact, has seen increased reporting and faith in their military justice system. these countries took serious crimes out of the chain of command because they believed that defendants have a right to civil liberties. they recognized that servicemembers deserve a trial not led by a commander, who often has no legal experience or education, but by trained criminal lawyers. when they made these changes, they did not see a diminution in command control or the ability to maintain good order and discipline within their ranks. in fact, when we stop asking commanders to act as judge and jury in complex cases, they will have more time to focus on rebuilding the trust and cohesion among their ranks that we know is critical to military readiness. we pride ourselves on having the best military in the world. to maintain it, we need to do more to make it safe for everyone to serve. our allies have already done this. every day we do not act is a day we fall further behind on this front. this is a tried and tested system. it has delivered change for our allies that the incremental reforms put in place by the armed services committee have not delivered to our servicemembers. this reform has been tested; requested by survivors, veterans, and commanders; backed by experts in military justice; and supported by 65 senators. there is no reason to delay a vote on the floor any further. i ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the republican leader, the senate armed services committee be discharged from further consideration of s. 1520 and the senate proceed to its consideration; that there be 2 hours for debate equally divided in the usual form; and that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the senate vote on the bill with no intervening action or debate. the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. reed. mr. president, reserving the right to object. for the reasons i articulated on monday and remain, i think, accurate, i would object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. mrs. gillibrand. mr. president, i would like to actually give some information to the chairman about what these other nations' leaders have actually said about this issue. major general blaise cathcart, advocate general of the canadian armed forces, wrote: the 1999 changes to the military justice system were battle tested in the theater of active operations and, in my view, were a key contributor to combat effectiveness of the canadian armed forces. the current military justice system contributed substantially to the fielding and sustainment of a disciplined and efficient force with high morale. air commander paul cronan, director general of the australian defense force legal service: at this point, it is appropriate to reflect on the effect of the reforms made to the australian military justice system in 2003 and 2006. these reforms have undoubtedly had a significant and positive impact on the efficacy, impartiality, and perceived fairness of australia's military justice system. this is a fact confirmed by a number of subsequent independent reviews of the effectiveness of the 2003 and 2006 reforms. as a result of their independent review, they concluded that the reforms had been effective, and that as a result of these reforms, ``the military justice system is delivering and should continue to deliver impartial, rigorous, and fair outcomes. enhanced transparency and enhanced oversight is substantially more independent from the chain of command, and is effective in maintaining a high standard of discipline both domestically and in the operational theater.'' in the uk, commander andrei spence, commodore naval legal service, royal navy, uk: probably the most pressing question that you need answering from me, and if i may preempt it slightly at the risk of being too forthcoming, is what is the effect on command of our changes? how do they view it? do they feel disempowered, disenfranchised? i have to say that the simple answer to that is no. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to enter this testimony into the record there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: mjiipa: allies testimony maj. gen. blaise cathcart, advocate general of the canadian armed forces ``the canadian armed forces require a robust and fair military justice system to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate allegations of sexual assault. as the superintendent of the administration of the canadian military justice system, i am confident our system meets the disciplinary needs of the chain of command while addressing the interests of victims and reflecting the constitutionality protected canadian values of fairness, transparency, and the rule of law . . . the 1999 changes to the military justice system were battle tested in the theater of active operations and, in my view were a key contributor to the combat effectiveness of the canadian armed forces. the current military justice system contributed substantially to the fielding and sustainment of a disciplined and efficient force with high morale.'' maj. gen. steve noonan, deputy commander, canadian joint operations command ``my intent is simply to inform the panel that as an operational commander, i am very comfortable with where we have evolved to, recognizing the continued key role of the commanding officer in the system, and the latitude that the system still provides for us to maintain good order and discipline, two key elements of operational effectiveness . . . in terms of the role of the commanding officer in the court martial process, in sensitive matters, like an alleged sexual assault, we believe it is in the best interest of the chain of command, the accused, and the complainant to have an independent investigator assess the evidence and lay charges, an independent prosecutor determine whether or not to proceed, and an independent court martial administrator convene a court martial. all of these actors, in my view, strengthen my role in the chain of command as those under my command can be confident in the real and perceived independence of the military justice system.'' air comm. paul cronan, director general, australian defense force legal service ``at this point, it is appropriate to reflect

how do they view it? do they feel disempowered, disenfranchised? i have to say that the simple answer to that is no.' mrs. gillibrand. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. mr. merkley. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 2103 mr. merkley. mr. president, i rise to support amendment no. 2103, which addresses a very important issue in the world, which is the issue of governments that undertake to destroy populations, either in other countries or within their own country; that is, to commit genocide. now, this topic comes up because china is committing genocide against its own uighur population--a million uighurs who are enslaved, who are trapped, who are assaulted in every possible way by the official authorities operating out of beijing. the finding of genocide is one that the state department takes very seriously. it involves long investigations, collection of evidence, analysis. it is not something to say lightly. but we now have two secretaries of state who have led our state department through this process and reached the same conclusion--secretary pompeo, under president trump, and secretary blinken, under president biden. and both find that this is, in fact, genocide. now, at this very moment, athletes are preparing to compete in the olympic games in china, and i find it horrific that the prestige of the games is going to be carried on for a country that is committing genocide. now, we have a commission that works on human rights issues, known as the congressional-executive commission on china, and it hauls a whole team of experts who work to analyze human rights issues. this commission, which is bipartisan and bicameral and includes executive branch appointees, when they are actually appointed, has held a hearing. at that hearing, various experts came and testified on what china is doing. it reinforced what the secretary of state under our former president and the secretary of state under our current president found: genocide is being conducted by the government in china against the uighur population and that is not all china is doing. there are other afflicted groups that it is assaulting. in addition, it has proceeded to start stripping the political rights of the people of hong kong. it is very much in the news. we have seen the citizens protesting in the streets, hundreds of thousands, saying: china, honor the commitment you made when britain transferred hong kong back under a 50-year agreement to china. and china has not honored that agreement. now, china, when it was awarded the games back in 2015 to be held in 2022--7 years in advance--made human rights promises to the international olympic committee--promises that have not been upheld. in fact, during those years, china has become an even worse violator of human rights in hong kong, in xinjiang, and in other ethnic areas, including tibet. so we have echoes of 1936--the year the summer olympics were held in germany and hitler was in charge. he used those olympic games to shine prestige on his country and to essentially help distract enormously from his already horrific actions against jewish germans and other groups within germany. so how is it here, nearly a century later, that, again, the olympics are going to be used to shine a little bit of light and a lot of prestige on a country engaged in genocide? i want to compliment my colleague senator romney of utah. he has placed in the underlying bill, as it came out of the foreign relations committee, a provision that says: when the olympics are held, there should be a diplomatic boycott to protest and draw attention to this egregious situation. i hope, also, that the sponsors of those games will start to withdraw their sponsorships. now, my friend and colleague senator romney is an expert on the olympic games because he organized the olympic games in utah. nobody in america probably knows more about what it takes to prepare for them. and it is not, at this moment, possible for the structure that has been established to host the athletes to be redone and to pivot for just next year, which i find unfortunate, but i understand the point. so let us do this together. let us send a strong message to the olympic committee, the ioc, that never again should they allow a country to host the olympic games that is engaged in genocide. this should be a message that every american can say together--that never should a country be given the prestige of hosting the games when they are committing genocide. never should a country be able to host the games when it is something like what china is doing to the uighur population--enslaving them, stripping them of their dignity, their autonomy, their culture, controlling them in every way, enslaving them. never again should the games be able to be hosted by a country like china that is restricting the political rights of hong kong--what china is doing, stripping the freedom of speech, stripping the freedom of assembly, and breaking the deal that it signed when the deal was struck with britain for the return of hong kong. so this amendment, cosponsored by senator rubio, who is the cochair in the senate of the congressional-executive commission on china; cosponsored by senator romney, who knows more about the olympic games than anybody else in this country; cosponsored by senator young, who has been a terrific champion against the abuse of citizens in yemen and the abuse of citizens in burma--let us adopt this amendment as part of this package while we are on the topic of china, while we are on the topic of trade. let us not let this moment bypass us without saying with a unified voice that this is wrong, and that the olympics, which were designed to lift up the human spirit, to celebrate the best of competition, to have kind of the thrills and the agonies of victory and defeat--that never should the games, the focal point of world attention, be hosted by a country that is committing genocide. thank you. the presiding officer. the senator from california. january 6 commission mr. padilla. mr. president, colleagues, this coming monday is memorial day. many of us are making our plans to commemorate the holiday, the weekend, where we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation and in defense of our democracy-- those brave americans and so many others who have worked, fought, and died for more than 200 years to protect our system of government--of the people, by the people, for the people. upholding that legacy is our highest duty, and it is in that spirit that i rise today. on november 3, 2020, i was serving as california's secretary of state. it was my privilege for 6 years to serve as the chief elections officer in our nation's most populous and most diverse state, and i can tell you that even in the best of times, election administration is complex. elections are consequential operations. last year, our elections workers at all levels of government faced the additional, unprecedented challenge of administering an election during a global health pandemic. and i am proud to say that they rose to the occasion to protect the democratic legacy that we hold and trust. and, as a result, california's election officials administered an accessible, secure, and safe election, which drew historic voter turnout. indeed, by every objective measure, the 2020 elections were a national success. but none of this mattered to president trump, who had spent years attacking the integrity of our elections by repeatedly lying about voter fraud and ``rigged elections,'' even the election that he won in 2016. president trump was furious at his 2020 loss, and he chose to take a sledgehammer to the core of our democratic system. he did not just refuse to concede the election--breaking a tradition that dates back to thomas jefferson--president trump attacked the very notion of a peaceful transition of power. [[page s3844]] along the way, he filed and lost more than 60 cynical lawsuits challenging the election. he personally called state elections officials and pressured them to alter vote tallies--tallies that had been counted, recounted, and audited. and he lied to the american people, tweeting out a steady stream of conspiracy theories and disinformation denying his electoral loss. online and around the country, president trump's big lie caught fire. sadly, many republican officials participated in fanning the flames, spreading fears of voter fraud for political gain. others stood by silently as president trump radicalized his supporters with falsehoods. they chose loyalty to trump over the truth, delusion over democracy. let me be clear. these allegations of fraud had no basis in fact. they were rooted in trump's ego and cemented in white supremacy. and they led directly to the deadly insurrection of january 6, an unprecedented attack on our nation's capitol by violent extremists against the u.s. house of representatives and this senate, invited and incited by the president of the united states. armed rioters brutally beat capitol police officers and stormed this building. the confederate flag, the symbol of violent white supremacy, flew inside this capitol for the first time in our nation's history. members of militarized hate groups searched these hallways with the intent to kill elected leaders of both parties. they made their way to this very floor to try to stop the certification of the presidential election, and in so doing, they terrorized our staff, capitol police, the free press, our citizens across the country, and our democracy itself. through their violence, the january 6 rioters disrupted our democracy at the behest of president trump, and our nation lost the right to call the transition of power peaceful. now we gather in the wake of this armed insurrection, the deadly insurrection. the scars of january 6 can still be seen throughout the building. yet many of my republican colleagues say: we just need to move on. let us just move forward. they say that this deadly attack was simply a group of ``peaceful protesters'' on a ``normal tourist visit''? they claim that the proposed commission to investigate the january 6 insurrection is unnecessary because we have already increased capitol security and our congressional committees are already investigating this attack. these arguments are outrageous. of course we need an independent commission to fully investigate the causes of the attack. we need to know the whole truth about january 6. we need and the american people deserve an independent, bipartisan investigation that will give us the facts and allow us to begin the hard work of restoring public trust in our democracy. it is the only way to ensure that an attack like this does not happen again. the bipartisan bill we are considering is modeled after the bipartisan 9/11 commission. imagine arguing in the wake of 9/11 that the only problem that we needed to address was airport security. that is how ridiculous this counterargument is. to brush aside the january 6 attack on the american people would be the ultimate dereliction of our duty. colleagues, we swore an oath to support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies, foreign and domestic. so i call on my republican colleagues to live up to that oath, live up to that sacred duty. and if you cannot, if your hand is frozen by fear of those who were misled to believe that the election was stolen, if your hand is frozen out of fear of the president who sold that lie, then the insurrectionists have succeeded. i urge the senate to authorize the january 6 commission on a bipartisan vote, but if our republican colleagues refuse to join us, then we will face another choice: do we continue to defend our system of self-government or defend the filibuster? the stakes could not be higher. the choice could not be clearer. the peaceful transition of power must be defended. colleagues, this is a moment where we must put country over politics, put the institutions of our democracy over the abuse of the filibuster. on january 6, our government was attacked, and now the future of our democracy is on the line. let us act like it. i yield the floor i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. murphy. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. s. 1260 mr. murphy. mr. president, i wanted to come to the floor very briefly today to thank chairman menendez and ranking member risch for the great work they did on the foreign relations committee to add to the pending legislation a title developed in the foreign relations committee that makes sure that we are building the kinds of capacities inside the state department and usaid that are able to make sure america can compete with china and a host of other developing, advancing nations all around the world. the fact is, we are often fighting our competitors with one hand tied behind our back. for instance, the size of the chinese international development bank dwarfs the capacities of the similar institution that is used by the united states of america, the dfc. we have added new capacities to the dfc in this legislation that will allow the united states of america to be able to make sure that we can do development deals around the world and compete with other nations that are fast investing significant amounts of money and trying to use that money as leverage to gain political interest and political influence. included in that title, midwifed through the senate foreign relations committee, is a provision that builds upon the expectation that congress should have that the administration share with us agreements that they have entered into on behalf of the united states. if we want to play our constitutional role to be a coequal branch with the executive on the setting of american foreign policy, then, of course, this body needs to have access--immediate access--to any agreements, whether they be binding or nonbinding, that the federal government, through the executive branch, has entered into on behalf of the american people. i am very pleased that the legislation includes a requirement that, in an expeditious manner, the executive branch, whether there is a republican president or a democratic president, share with congress any agreements that they have entered into on behalf of our constituents. that section of the bill goes a little bit further than that, though. it also says that the administration shall notify congress anytime that the administration is beginning a negotiation over a prospective agreement with a foreign nation. again, that, on its face, makes a lot of sense, the idea that the administration should be communicating with congress when they have begun a significant negotiation with a foreign country that may ultimately obligate the united states or this congress with respect to an international agreement. i raised, during the consideration of this bill in the foreign relations committee and i have continued to raise both publicly and privately, concerns i have that i think are shared by current and former diplomats that there is a potential that by going too far in our request that the administration inform us of negotiations, we could provide a chill on both our government's willingness to enter into what are sometimes very sensitive, early negotiations with foreign governments but also a chill on foreign nations' interest in entering into negotiations with the united states of america if they were to understand that anytime they began a conversation with the united states about a very sensitive matter, there would be a notification to congress that could easily become public. in fact, there are good reasons sometimes where the executive branch, early on in a negotiation, before they know whether it is even going to become an agreement a year, 2 years down the line, would want the space to conduct that negotiation without the public eye coming down on those proceedings. so i think there is a way to get this right. i think that we want to make [[page s3845]] sure that any agreements are sent to congress. i can even understand how, in some circumstances, when you are talking about big negotiations of national significance, we would want to know at some point when those negotiations have begun. but i think you have to understand that there are two equities at play here. one is transparency, the right of congress to get information from the executive branch, but the other equity is that we do not want to do anything here that would disincentivize diplomacy, that would create a massive bureaucracy inside the state department that would serve as a barrier to negotiations with countries that may avoid a war or may end up in a more efficient expenditure of u.s. taxpayer dollars. so i want to raise this concern about this language that is included in the substitute amendment. i know that there is a long way before this bill is law. obviously, the house will take up their own version, and there will be some reconciliation between the house and the senate. and i am glad to have senator menendez's commitment to continue to have this discussion to make sure that we balance these equities--the equity of congress's right to know with the equity to invest and incentivize in american diplomacy. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from north dakota is recognized. tribute to lynn aas mr. cramer. mr. president, it is a great honor for me today to recognize a north dakota legend who is celebrating his 100th birthday on june 4. lynn aas, of minot, is one of our state's most treasured residents. with his engaging personality and deep commitment to public service, lynn has experienced many great moments in our state's and in our nation's history. lynn was raised during the great depression on a farm near the town of benedict, 40 miles south of minot. he earned law and business degrees from the university of north dakota, managed a medical clinic, served in the north dakota legislature for 8 years, and was a delegate to the state's 1972 constitutional convention. he and his late wife beverly raised four sons. to this day, lynn remains active in his community. with all that has been so remarkable about lynn's life, it is his service during world war ii that resonates the most with those who know him. like with so many other young north dakotans, the japanese attack on pearl harbor in december of 1941 changed the course of lynn's life. in august 1942, lynn had just finished his first year of college when he enlisted in the u.s. army. he began basic training in march 1943 and became part of the 193rd glider infantry regiment of the 17th airborne division. following intensive training stateside, he boarded a ship in boston in august 1944 heading to liverpool, england. lynn's first combat experience was the battle of the bulge, one of the costliest battles in american history, with more than 80,000 u.s. casualties, including 19,000 american soldiers killed. his division and unit were flown to france and transported by trucks to bastogne on december 24, 1944. his platoon entered combat on january 7, fighting in deep snow, frigid cold, and heavy fog. beginning with 55 troopers, lynn was one of only 5 survivors to leave the frontlines 3 weeks later. the end of january brought his first 2 nights of sleep under a roof in 5 weeks. in february, his platoon fought along the siegfried line on nazi germany's border. later in march, he participated in operation varsity, the last large- scale allied airborne operation of the war. there, he was towed in a glider and landed behind enemy lines near wesel, germany. lynn's combat days ended on march 25 when he was wounded in his left arm by shrapnel. following extensive recuperation back in america, lynn remained in the army another 5 months until he was honorably discharged on november 1, 1945. for his valor and commendable 18 months of service during world war ii, he was awarded the purple heart and bronze star medals, in addition to the glider badge, combat infantryman's badge, good conduct medal, american campaign medal, european campaign medal with one bronze arrowhead and three bronze campaign stars, and the world war ii victory medal. later in his life, lynn attend reunions of the 17th airborne division. in 1999, he visited europe with other 17th airborne division veterans, visiting the locations where they had fought more than 55 years earlier. in 2015, he visited belgium again to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the battle of the bulge. as one of the official representatives from the united states to this observance, lynn was greeted by many grateful belgians who had not forgotten what american soldiers did to liberate them from hitler's tyranny. in 2017, the french government awarded lynn its highest honor, the knight of the legion of honor medal--an award created by napoleon in 1802. it was my great honor to be at that commemoration. the letter from the french government notifying lynn of this award carried these poignant words: 73 years ago, you gave your youth to france and the french people. many of your fellow soldiers did not return but they remain in our hearts. . . . you saved us. we will never forget. for us, the french people, you are a hero. gratitude and remembrance are forever in our souls. mr. president, lynn aas was one of 60,000 north dakotans to serve in the u.s. armed forces during world war ii. of those, nearly 2,000 gave their lives for our freedom in this largest and deadliest conflict in world history. with only some 500 world war ii veterans still alive in north dakota, the heroism of every single one of them is appreciated more than ever. throughout his life, lynn aas has embodied the best of the ``greatest generation.'' he has lived a meaningful life, sharing his history as a world war ii soldier throughout so the rest of us can better understand and appreciate the selfless service and sacrifice of every veteran. on behalf of all north dakotans, i wish lynn aas a very happy 100th birthday on june 4 and many more years of health and vitality. as he celebrates with his large family and many friends in minot, i honor him as one of north dakota's most exemplary citizens. i yield back. the presiding officer. the senator from texas is recognized mr. cornyn. mr. president, i would like to thank our friend senator cramer for telling us this story about this great american patriot. many of us are of that age where we are the children of members of the ``greatest generation'' who have their own stories to tell. just listening to senator cramer talk about this great patriot who fought at the battle of the bulge, one of the most horrific battles in world war ii and most consequential battles--that is really where they really stopped hitler, finally, toward the end of the war--it reminds me of people like my dad who flew b-17s out of england during the last part of the war. their job was to knock out the hitler war machine. but there are so many great stories from that generation. these great world war ii patriots are getting older, and they are leaving us, but certainly we will always remember them and their contributions. so i appreciate the senator from north dakota sharing that with us. s. 1260 mr. president, the senate is moving quickly, i hope, toward a vote on a far-reaching proposal to confront threats from china. based on everything we know about the might and the ambitions of the chinese communist party, there is a clear and urgent need for us to take action. every year, the u.s. intelligence community issues a threat assessment report outlining the greatest challenges confronting our country on the horizon. topping the latest report, which was released last month, is china's push for global power. the report outlines china's efforts to strengthen its military power, diversify its nuclear arsenal, and fine-tune its cyber espionage skills, which are already quite considerable. one major area that cannot be overlooked is china's industrial policy. through the ccp's made in china 2025 initiative, it seeks to achieve china's dominance in high-tech manufacturing. for everything from electric cars to advanced robotics, to artificial [[page s3846]] intelligence, to quantum computing, china wants to lead global production, and they are throwing serious money into the effort to get there. china is expected to spend $1.4 trillion by 2025, covering investments in everything from 5g to artificial intelligence. the 2021 threat assessment report raises alarm bells here too. it says china will maintain these efforts because ``chinese leaders see this strategy as necessary to reduce dependence on foreign technologies, enable military advances, and sustain economic growth and thus ensure the ccp's survival.'' i view this as both an alarming statement but really more as a call to action. if china is making these kinds of investments to increase its independence and global presence, we should be investing in our industrial base and our national security here at home. the most important place to start, i believe, is with semiconductor manufacturing. the pandemic is hopefully soon to be in our rearview mirror as more and more americans, more and more people get vaccinated. one of the most important lessons i believe we should have learned is the vulnerability of our supply chains, everything from personal protective equipment, most of which is made in china--and in the global race to get the ppe we needed during the pandemic, china got a head start because china manufactured it and we did not here at home. so that opened up my eyes to the vulnerability of that supply chain, but we cannot stop there. we need to look at how heavily we rely on other countries for semiconductors because nearly 90 percent of the semiconductors in the world are made in southeast asia, with taiwan dominating the market. in fact, one company, taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company, accounted for more than one-half of total foundry revenues last year. companies in taiwan control 63 percent of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the world. now, if you are like me, before i got involved in this issue, i did not really know very much about semiconductors, so i asked my staff to explain to me the significance of this vulnerability. they said: well, senator, think of it this way: everything with an off and on switch involves semiconductors. well, that helped me quite a bit. then i asked them to research something for me. i said: you see those rockets that are raining down on israel from hamas? some of those interceptors are made by raytheon, an american-based defense contractor. ask them how many semiconductors are in a single interceptor. they did the research, and they reported back--750 semiconductors in a single interceptor. so these semiconductors or microelectronics are everywhere, everywhere--in the phones we carry, in the planes that our air force, navy, and marines are flying, the fifth-generation stealth fighter, the f-35. semiconductors are everywhere. given china's ambitions, it is easy to imagine how they might be tempted to interfere with the supply chain and our dependence on asian-produced semiconductors. if china were to block or even invade taiwan, we would be literally helpless. back in 1980, jimmy carter gave a speech in which he laid down what came to be known as the carter doctrine. this was 2 years after the soviet union invaded afghanistan. he wanted to send a message to the world that they should not mess with u.s. access to the oil that came through the strait of hormuz in the middle east. so he laid down the carter doctrine. he said: anybody who interferes with our access to the oil that we need to power our armed services and our economy, that would be an act of war. well, i do not think it is an exaggeration to say if another country were to block our access to semiconductors, it could well rise to the same sort of act of war that jimmy carter warned about in 1980. in other words, semiconductors have become the new oil in terms of our dependency, and it is a dangerous dependency we must correct. this is precisely why the senior senator from virginia and i, senator warner, introduced the chips for america act. it is crucial that we shore up our dependence on chips manufactured overseas and we shore up our domestic production. the vast majority of our colleagues have agreed that this is a critical task. it was carefully crafted after monthslong bipartisan, bicameral negotiations. recently, we had a meeting at the white house, and president biden agreed with us that this was a critical imperative. this is literally a bipartisan, bicameral agreement with the executive branch and legislative branch that this is something we need to fix. last fall, when we took up the national defense authorization act, we introduced an amendment that authorized what we now hope to be able to pay for, which is an amendment to the defense authorization act, which passed 96 to 4. now we need to fund the program, and there is just one issue standing in the way. during committee consideration of the endless frontier act, an amendment was adopted that would apply controversial davis-bacon language to the underlying chips for america provision signed into law last year. this provision creates, i believe, an unnecessary distraction from our focus, which should be on defeating this vulnerability in the supply chain. the fact is, current wages of u.s. semiconductor manufacturing companies do not need davis-bacon. they pay much better than the prevailing wage davis-bacon would require. so it is really a nonissue when it comes to semiconductor manufacturing. but what is more significant--and i think the reason why some of our democratic friends are insisting on this inclusion--is it represents an expansion over labor policies by applying it to private construction as opposed to public works. obviously, this would set a troublesome precedent. leaving this language in the bill, i do believe, has the potential to weaken the support for the broader legislation. and i hope we can all agree that the stakes are too high to risk letting that happen. last week, i introduced an amendment to strike this unnecessary and divisive provision and maintain strong bipartisan support for the underlying chips for america legislation. a partisan provision with zero impact is hardly a reason to sacrifice the strong bipartisan support we have seen for the chips act. republicans and democrats have worked very closely together and, i think, really in an encouraging and responsible way to bolster domestic manufacturing of semiconductors and confront one of the biggest looming threats to our national security and our economic security. now is not the time to backpedal on the progress we have made. i expect the senate will vote on my amendment later this evening. i encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment so we can maintain the strong bipartisan support we have demonstrated so far for this critical, critical legislation. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. ms. cantwell. mr. president, i come to follow my colleague from texas to talk about the very issue that he brought up, which is where is america going with semiconductor manufacturing, design, and development. on this last point, i am pretty sure we see things differently. i am pretty sure that the majority--probably all of the democrats would be enthusiastic about supporting both manufacturing in the united states as well as making sure that if federal dollars are used, prevailing wage should be applied. i am sure we will differ on that point. but i think that we are, at least on our side of the aisle, supportive of this concept that chip fabrication, chip manufacturing in the united states of america is an important sector and that we are facing a chip shortage and that we should do something about it. if you think about it, semiconductors are like the oil of the 21st century. they have become an essential aspect. they can be found in children's toys, in appliances, computers, cell phones, our telecommunications networks, and advanced national security technology, as my colleague was mentioning. they enable healthcare, artificial intelligence applications, financial services, and certainly in the area of defense. they have transformed how we communicate, how we learn, how we socialize. yet they are so complex and manufacturing so expensive, it can cost anywhere from $5 to almost $20 billion--$20 [[page s3847]] billion is one number i have heard--just to build these facilities. this is why this issue has become so important. the united states has had strong leadership in the semiconductor area, but massive investments from other nations put us at a disadvantage when it comes to manufacturing. they are subsidizing and getting tax benefits up to 40 percent to build in korea than in the united states of america. the endless frontier act tries to address that because it really is a national security and telecommunications policy in the 1990s, the united states produced over 37 percent of the global chips supply. as you know, here in the united states, we have 48 percent of the world's aircraft production, but now with these challenges, as we look at the chip supply, they are down to 12 percent. i noticed in the wall street journal they said: why do we care? why do we care? they basically are saying that chips in fabrication have become a commodity and that we do not have to worry about it anymore. as long as we are winning on the design side, we do not care where it is manufactured. well, if you ask me, that is so 1980s--i mean, the idea that you could design a product here and then have it manufactured somewhere else. maybe that works with shoes or outdoor clothing, but it does not work with something as sophisticated and changing as a high-tech innovation product like semiconductors. in fact, i would say, if you really think that type of thinking works, just look at what happened. it is really pro-covid thinking. we thought we could have the design done here and, basically, some of these devices that we use here, like ventilators, we will just produce them overseas. what could possibly go wrong? well, we figured out what could go wrong. if we are not manufacturing ventilators here in the united states, something could go wrong, and it did. the question is, what is going to go wrong if we do not manufacture chips in the united states of america? the thing i do not think that the wall street journal quite got right is that they do not understand that in today's innovation cycle, having a cluster of design, of manufacturing, of supply chain, of customers--everybody working together is the new way to have an economic advantage. in fact, there is a recent study done by a chicago research organization. i am going to read from this report. basically, it is all about clusters and why clusters are so important: an industry cluster is a group of firms, related stakeholders, and supportive institutions that gain productive advantages from close geographic proximity and related economies of scale. as groups of related industries grow and develop, clustering can help lower business costs and increase the extent of benefits of specialization. deeper labor pools, better access to customers and suppliers, knowledge spillover--these and other advantages are derived from an environment of balanced competition and collaboration. i could go on. i will submit it for the record. that is what is happening with semiconductors. the asian market has, basically, now become the epicenter for this level of production, and the question is, are we just going to forgo that and end up, basically, with not 12 percent of market share here but 6 percent of market share? then our suppliers are going to continue to go where the investments and the energy and the ideas are. that is why in the united states of america, where we still have clusters in various parts of the united states--my colleague from texas knows this well because he has a cluster in texas. my colleague from oregon, who was out here earlier, knows because they have a cluster there. there are clusters in places like arizona. this is about whether the united states of america is going to continue to make this investment ourselves. chips are essential to our national security and to telecommunications. in 1990, we produced over 37 percent of global chip supply, and we need to continue to make sure that we are going to be an investor in chip fabrication today. today, as i said, we are at an inflection point because of what is happening in a global basis. according to goldman sachs, 169 industries in the united states have products with embedded semiconductors, and there will be a 20-percent shortfall of components needed for those products. last month, caterpillar, headquartered in illinois, said it anticipated the chip shortage impairing its ability to meet growing demand of construction and mining equipment. we are not just talking about kids' gaming consoles or computers. we are talking about many sectors of our economy that depend on this. national security experts argue that if there were a greater trade war or military conflict, the united states would not be able to fill its demand for chips for national security and critical infrastructure needs. that means people like car manufacturers, appliance manufacturers--if you think about 5g and new technology--the post-pandemic economy will not be able to keep moving forward. the shortage also forced the auto sector to cut 27,000 jobs in april alone. earlier this year, general motors temporarily shut down three north american plants due to the shortage. ford cut back michigan production of f-150s and the popular explorer. and dodge is reducing worker schedules in a nevada plant producing the jeep grand cherokee and dodge durango. these are having real-life impacts on us today. the question is, we had a ripple of this just because of covid. what if we had a ripple of this because somebody decided not to supply things to us? these are things we have to worry about just in a national security perspective. you have to worry about whether we are going to get a supply chain that we can depend on. we really are at an inflection point. we are at an inflection point where we need to do something about this sector. one of the issues also is that chip fabrication and private r&d make huge investments. what we are talking about here represents a very small r&d investment partnership with the private sector as it relates to this. we are talking about trying to get more manufacturing jobs here in the united states. my colleague was just discussing this sector, overall, and one of the things that people should think about--and i am pretty sure people at home will not be able to see this--but these jobs in production and in various aspects of design and even on some of the other aspects, even in management and computer, these are all well-paying jobs. these are jobs that, literally, are the types of jobs we want to be producing in the united states. i heard this story about idaho. micron, a big company that used to be a major chip fabrication--they are still doing chip fabrication--but the number of jobs in boise, id, has fallen off, probably in the thousands, because this production has gone to other places. now we are replacing them with call center jobs. the question is whether we are going to make this investment in a key technology critical to our national security--critical to a lot of applications of the technology future, whether it is 5g or ai or various things--and whether we are going to be a competitor in this area of a supply chain and cluster that continues to innovate. we know for a fact that semiconductor jobs in the production area are literally $94,000 a year. that is why we are fighting for this because it is a sector, in just the production end, that is high-paying jobs. so are we going to spend time letting things go overseas and basically saying, ``ok, they will allow us to have call centers,'' or are we going to fight for these high-paying jobs in the semiconductor space that we know will help us maintain our expertise and skill in the united states? i ask my colleagues to just think about the fact that this notion that we design something here and ship it overseas for cheap production does not fit this bill. that is not what we need to do to maintain competitiveness, in the information age, on something as important as semiconductors. i think our history is rich with people like thomas edison and the edison park, which is what we established in new jersey, or menlo park, or what now exists in seattle or in various places. people get that innovation happens in clusters. so, if we are going to innovate, we have to make sure the united states is attracting this investment. we have to make sure that we are doing this here, on our shores, with the expertise and support. [[page s3848]] a lot of my colleagues might say: well, do you know what? let us just have the private sector do this r&d. as i said, the private sector spends a lot on r&d. in fact, we think the private sector spends about $377 billion a year on r&d. yet, as we know, r&d is not just done by the private sector for its specific interest. basic science and lots of advanced research and applied science are done by the united states. that is why this bill is plussing up this number here from the national science foundation. we had discussions here about plussing up the number from the department of energy. obviously, we had a vote in the senate of even increasing the defense advanced research projects agency and its dollars. what works about the united states of america is that we are an ecosystem. we are not a top-down. it is not like we are basically the government, saying: this is what is going to be done. we create an ecosystem that is really based on american know-how--our ingenuity in how to get things done. what we are asking for, as it relates to not only nsf funding in order to continue the work of r&d as it relates to semiconductors, is also to make sure that we are going to continue the focus of manufacturing and design and r&d and development and clustering and supply chain and companies working together. i know how important this is because, in the seattle area, in washington state, we are a leader in aerospace technology. we are 49 percent, in the united states, of aerospace manufacturing. if you do not keep manufacturing, do you think the supply chain will stay in seattle? do you think the supply chain would stay in seattle forever--all of those companies? we have hundreds of companies that make products for boeing. do you think they would stay there if it were not there? they will end up moving where the manufacturing is. that is what the information age is about, and it is certainly about that when it comes to technology products. the technology products are developed faster, quicker, and with the innovation and the input from their customers. that is why, if you look at these centers around the united states, they are also the places at which you will find the biggest users of this technology. they are there, and they are there because they want to be close to their customers. they want to understand their customers' needs. they want to have interaction. they want to have collaboration. that is what innovation is today. innovation is doing design and manufacturing close together. that is how we win. that is why we need to pass this legislation as it relates to an investment in chip design and manufacturing r&d and so we continue to attract manufacturing in the united states. back to my colleague from texas, who i know agrees with this principle in an underlying way, when the federal government wants to make an investment in actual construction, we say that we should apply prevailing wage. i have talked to many of these people in the semiconductor manufacturing-design space. they say: do you see how expensive it is to do these plans? do you see how expensive the equipment is? it is very expensive; so we need the best workforce. so guess what. we pay prevailing wage. so we are saying, because we are putting federal dollars on the table, we should pay prevailing wage. they think we should also pay prevailing wage. i am not speaking for them, but, in general, they feel like that is when they get their best product. i know where my side of the aisle is. we are going to be here to make an investment in this particular sector. we are going to figure out how to be competitive against asia in semiconductor manufacturing. we are going to continue, as andy grove said, to be paranoid because we know that this is a changing landscape, and we are going to follow our colleagues who have made these decisions and make an investment for the future. i ask our colleagues to turn down the motion to strike the underlying bill, as the underlying bill already has this provision in it, and let us get about this business of waiving a budget point of order and deciding to make the investment that we need to make to be competitive in a key sector of the u.s. economy. if we do that, i guarantee you we will be well-positioned to continue to move forward, and our national security will be more secure because we will have made this decision. i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. kaine). the senator from north dakota military appreciation month mr. hoeven. mr. president, i rise to mark military appreciation month and to pay tribute to the many military members and veterans who have sacrificed in service to our nation. this month provides an opportunity to show our immense gratitude to all those who have donned a uniform in our armed forces. the freedoms and blessings we enjoy as a nation have been secured by their hard work and determination. military appreciation month culminates in memorial day--the date set aside to honor the men and women who have given the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation. while we honor their memory on memorial day, we remember their loss every day and extend our gratitude to their loved ones, as well as to those who continue to serve. we also recognize that those who serve do not serve alone. the friends and families of those in the service of our country also serve, and those who have lost loved ones know too well the cost of our freedoms. i believe that we best honor and pay tribute to our military members by thanking them, both past and present, and by ensuring they have the resources and support they have so richly earned. as a member of the senate defense and veterans' affairs appropriations subcommittees, i have worked with my colleagues to ensure that our veterans and military members are properly trained and equipped and receive the care, benefits, and recognition they were promised. our servicemembers and their families have given much in defense of our nation, and the state of north dakota, especially, has a rich tradition of military service. my state is home to some of the country's most premier air force installations, including the minot and grand forks air force bases and cavalier air station. we have more than 7,300 active-duty servicemembers who are currently serving in north dakota and performing missions that are essential to our national security. in addition, more than 4,400 men and women serve in the north dakota national guard. currently, more than 53,000 veterans call north dakota home. we are grateful for the many servicemembers and veterans who have served our country, and we honor their service every day but especially during military appreciation month. we will never forget the sacrifices of those who gave their lives so we can enjoy the freedoms that we are so blessed to have today and every day tribute to lynn aas and john sinn mr. president, there is no better example of service and sacrifice than that of our ``greatest generation.'' i would like to honor two world war ii veterans, as well as the kiwanis club of minot, nd, of which they have both been lifelong members. this year marks the 100th anniversary of the minot kiwanis club, as well as the 100-year birthdays of two kiwanis members, mr. lynn aas and mr. john sinn. since its founding on may 27, 1921, the kiwanis club of minot has helped to make my home town, where i grew up, a better place to live. as a former member myself of this organization, i deeply appreciate its continued dedication and contributions to the community and the surrounding area. some examples of its work include donating books to schools, supporting the arts, and raising money for local service organizations like the boy scouts, the juvenile drug court, and the domestic violence crisis center. in these ways, minot's local kiwanis chapter helps realize the mission of this international organization and makes a real difference to families and children in the region. for two individuals who have been lifelong members of that group, in the very same year the organization turns 100, it is their 100th birthdays as well. as part of the ``greatest generation'' and as world war ii veterans, lynn aas and john sinn have both been important parts of the minot community in so many ways and have set a great example not only in their service but [[page s3849]] in the service they have delivered throughout their lives even after world war ii. a native of mclean county, nd, lynn aas fought as a rifleman in the historic battle of the bulge. he served with the 17th airborne division of the 193rd airborne infantry and received the bronze star, the purple heart, and the french legion of honour medal. following the war, he returned to his home state, where he earned his law degree from the university of north dakota. in addition to being a lifelong kiwanis member, he served in our state's legislature for four sessions. he was the president of the minot chamber of commerce; served on the board for the united way; and has been a longtime supporter of minot state university and of so many, many other worthwhile things. his family and my family have been friends for as long as i can remember--truly, a great american. also, john sinn--another veteran of world war ii--has his 100th birthday as well. as a member of the 386th infantry regiment, john sinn served in the european theater, where he earned the bronze star. he returned home to farm with family members in ryder, nd, eventually going to work for the u.s. army corps of engineers in 1957. he retired in 1989, more than 30 years ago. however, rather than taking a well-earned rest, he has continued to serve the community as a volunteer. included among his volunteer efforts, he is best known for his work to improve and maintain the scandinavian heritage park--a beautiful scandinavian park in the community. it is truly an iconic outdoor museum. it is central to the community's identity and is home to the annual norsk hostfest, the largest celebration of scandinavian culture and history in north america. the presiding officer is invited any time he would like to come join us. it is a wonderful festival with wonderful food, and the best view of the park can be found at john sinn outlook, which is a testament to his many contributions. we recognize the hard work, dedication, and service of lynn aas, john sinn, and the entire minot kiwanis club as they celebrate their 100th birthdays this year. it is therefore appropriate to take this time to recognize their hard work, their dedication, and their service, and i have submitted a statement honoring that today. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from colorado. s. 1260 mr. bennet. mr. president, i am thrilled that we are passing this legislation. it is amazing to me--and i am sure the presiding officer would agree--that the senate has actually returned to regular order. we are passing amendments on both sides of the aisle, and i think we are going to have a big bipartisan vote here in the senate. in having been here for a number of years when the senate did not operate that way--it was incredibly dysfunctional--it is a great, great privilege to be here at a moment when it is working. so i want to express my sense of gratitude for that. january 6 commission mr. president, i also want to call the presiding officer's attention to news reports this afternoon that say that our colleagues on the republican side of the aisle have decided they are going to block this bipartisan commission to examine what happened on january 6 and that they are going to use the filibuster here to block a commission that some of them actually called for and a commission that, i think, 35 republican members of the house of representatives supported. i wanted to come to the floor to appeal to their conscience and to ask them to consider the damage that it will do to our democracy to not have this commission, as we have done at other important moments in the country's history. and, mr. president, you were here on january 6. i was here on january 6. we had been sent here--we came here--to accomplish the ministerial task that we are required after a presidential election is concluded, to certify the results of that election, to certify the ballots of millions and millions and millions of americans who voted in the last election. that is why we were here. unfortunately, we had a president at that time who denied that the election had actually happened. the president will remember that we also had colleagues that came to this floor and said that we were disrespecting the president's base or their base because we were certifying the election, instead of having enough respect for their base to tell them the truth, which was that the election had been decided by millions of voters, and by every court that looked at it and by incredibly brave local officials, many of them republicans, who would not allow the president to push them around. the 6th was a terrible day here. the people who invaded this capitol, the people who stormed the platform that had been set up for the peaceful transfer of power on january 20, when joe biden took the oath of office--the people who came here on january 6 cursed the capitol police. they bludgeoned the capitol police. they speared them. they hurled racial epithets, leading some of our african-american police officers here to ask what had happened to america. they broke windows in the capitol. they looted the parliamentarian's office--the people who would bravely carry the ballots out of this chamber, when we were led to the hart building, and protect those ballots that could have ended up getting burned out on the national mall, if they had not had the presence of mind to do their job--just like the capitol police, who were in mortal danger that day doing their job. and i remember, when we were all together in one of the senate office buildings, after they had rushed us out of here, we would later see that the mob was just a hallway away from here, and, actually, they were misdirected by another capitol police officer, who put his life in jeopardy to move them out of the way. we were taken to another building, a senate office building, and it was in that room--we were crowded in that room. it was in that room that i saw a scene that i never thought i would ever see as an american, on the tv sets that were on the walls of that room. while we were inside the room, we were watching the scene that everyone else in the country and everyone else across the world was watching of the u.s. capitol being invaded by our own people. i know the president will remember that when he was growing up, when i was growing up, that was not an uncommon sight to see in countries all over the world. there are a lot of countries that have had events like january 6 over the world, especially when there have been transitions of power or a tyrant unwilling to give up their power. but in a million years, i would never have imagined that it would happen here. and it did happen, and it sent a message all over the planet. while we were in that room, unable to certify this election, the chinese government had the greatest propaganda win that you could imagine, and in the weeks that followed, they have said democracy is in decline, democracy is failing. that is what the russians are saying. that is what the iranians are saying. and when i was there in that room that day, i thought a lot about my mom and her parents, who were polish jews, who survived the holocaust. the whole family was killed except for them and an aunt, and they were lucky enough that, after the war was over, they went to stockholm, sweden, for a year. they went to mexico city for a year, and then they came here to the only country in the world where they thought they could rebuild their shattered lives. and they did. and so even worse for me than the thought of our adversaries using this to undermine democracy was the understanding that people all over the world situated just like my mom and her parents would lose hope in the american ideal, would lose hope in democracy and in the rule of law. now, the good news is we actually had a january 20. a lot of countries that go through january 6 never get to january 20, and we had that, and joe biden took the oath of office and he became president of the united states, and kamala harris became the vice president of the united states. we had, notwithstanding all of the prior president's efforts to the contrary and the efforts of some of his allies in congress [[page s3850]] to the contrary--we had--a peaceful transfer of power. but consider how close we came, not just on the 6th, but consider what would have happened if elected officials, many of them republicans in georgia and in arizona and in michigan had not fulfilled their obligations to the rule of law, had not lived up to their oath of office, bent to the will of a president who did not want to relinquish power. where would we be then? imagine if the democrats, instead of winning a narrow majority in the house of representatives, had lost the majority in the house of representatives, and 140 or more--148--republican votes to decertify the election, to overturn the will of the voters, to disenfranchise millions and millions and millions of americans all of a sudden was a majority doing that, as the former president would have wanted. imagine if 60 judges, many of them republicans, appointed by president trump, who howled the president's lawyers out of courtroom after courtroom, after courtroom because, instead of doing what the president wanted them to do, instead of finding them ``a few more votes,'' as he said to the secretary of state in georgia, recorded on the phone, they did their job as judges and they withstood the pressure. they swore an oath, and they fulfilled their oath, and that is the only way democracy can actually work. it is when elected officials and judicial officials apply the rule of law, fulfill their oath and their obligation. and what i want to say to my colleagues today, i want to implore them and appeal to their conscience, because the responsibility to the democracy is not over. the democracy is still at risk. we still have a president of the united states--a former president--who refuses to concede the election, who, on a daily basis almost, says that the election was stolen. we still have members of congress who are saying the election was stolen. we still have members of congress who will not face the facts and tell their constituents the truth. i want to say again: respect your constituents enough that you are going to tell them the truth, and that is why, at difficult moments in our history, like after president kennedy was killed or the challenger exploded or 9/11 happened, we have had a bipartisan commission to make sure we understood what led us here and how we can do better coming out of this. it has never been perfect, but it has worked pretty well, and that is what we need here. we need to understand what led millions of americans to believe conspiracy theories about our own country and what led thousands of people to storm the capitol of the united states, to attack police officers, to attack police officers, leading to their death. from all over the country, they came to invade this capitol, and if we do not want it to happen again or we want to be able to protect ourselves, and i am not just talking about the poor capitol police, although that, at a bare minimum, ought to be enough to warrant a commission. i am talking about the danger of political violence in this nation going forward if we do not address this and the american people do not have the chance to understand what happened. as i mentioned, that night on january 6, standing at this desk on the floor, political violence is what brings these republics to an end. i am going to finish because i know there are others who want to speak, but let me just finish by saying how agonizing it was to watch officer sicknick's mom here today, going door to door to door, to ask people: please vote for this commission. i hope that people will reconsider. i hope they will search their conscience. the people around the world who watched january 6 are watching us today, and they want to know if democracy is up to the challenges of the 21st century. i believe it is. i believe it is. i think democracy is the highest expression of humanity on earth, and we are being tested in all kinds of ways right now, externally and internally. this would give us the chance to at least deal with the internal question. and i think at a moment like this it is important for us not to stand for a party or for a president but for the truth and for common sense and for our exercise in self-government. for all of those reasons, i hope that when we have the vote tonight, that it will succeed and the american people will have the benefit of a bipartisan commission to examine what happened on january 6 and help us understand how we can strengthen our democracy. with that, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from hawaii. unanimous consent request--h.r. 478 and s. 789 en bloc mr. schatz. mr. president, the senate has a solemn duty to exercise and fulfill u.s. federal trust responsibility. this duty is the guiding principle for all our work on behalf of american indians, alaska natives, and native hawaiians. so as the chairman of the senate committee on indian affairs, it is my job to prioritize and push tribal and native communities' legislative priorities toward the finish line and ultimately to actually enact legislation. the indian affairs committee has a strong tradition of bipartisanship going back decades. committee members on both sides of the aisle routinely work together to achieve their own native communities' goals. when there are disagreements, we do everything we can to work them out internally and to find common ground so that members are not forced to air their disagreements when bills get to the floor. in fact, just last night, the senate passed eight indian affairs bills unanimously. those bills would, among other things, promote economic development, protect native children, honor tribal self- determination--goals that we all agreed take important steps toward fulfilling our shared federal trust responsibilities. time and again, we have shown that the indian affairs bills can rise above partisan logjams. that compromise can be found. but here we are. h.r. 478, which passed the house on may 12, 2021, under suspension of the rules, would help to rebuild tribal homelands; and s. 789, which passed the senate unanimously in late november 2019, would repeal 11 obsolete, racist, unenforced laws that are inconsistent with the current government-to-government relationship enjoyed by the united states and indian tribes. both bills would likely be laws by now if the covid-19 pandemic had not disrupted our legislative work last year. these bills are good policy. that is why both republican and democratic administrations support them. and the senate should have passed these bills last night, but because there was an objection to their inclusion in the 10-bill package, we find ourselves here again. the indian affairs committee, as is tradition, has negotiated in good faith to clear up any concerns there may be, but those efforts were not successful, which leads me to this moment. when it comes to fulfilling the u.s. trust responsibility, there is no room for partisanship. so i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to the immediate consideration of the following bills en bloc: calendar no. 59, h.r. 478, the blackwater trading post land transfer act; and calendar no. 53, s. 789, the respect act; further, that the bills be considered read a third time and passed en bloc and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table en bloc, with no intervening action or debate. the presiding officer. is there objection? the senator from utah. mr. lee. mr. president, reserving the right to object, one of the bills in question--specifically, h.r. 478, would direct the secretary of the interior to take 55.3 acres of land owned by the gila river indian community into trust. the gila river indian community reservation is already 583 square miles, with a population of 11,000. the gila river indian community already owns this land, so why we need to take more land into trust and have the federal government more involved in the management of the land is not immediately obvious or apparent to me. the answer is not at all clear as to why it needs to be in trust. trust land responsibilities for the federal government are significant and before we expand the size of our trust lands, we have to have an understanding of what we are doing and the actual need to do it [[page s3851]] proponents of this legislation have claimed that the tribe has a unique history with this particular plot of land--this particular 55.3 acres of land--adjacent to the trust land. but from the history shown, the tribe's interaction with the land is mostly that they have had friendly neighbors with whom they have traded goods. as many of my colleagues are aware, i have great concerns that i have quite consistently expressed with further expanding the federal government's management or involvement in public lands, including trust lands. nevertheless, i have been engaging in negotiations, and i have made a number of good-faith efforts to develop a possible path forward--one in which the amount of acreage owned or held in trust by the federal government would not grow, while taking this land into trust for the gila river indian community. while i continue to negotiate a path forward, i am not inclined to abandon this concern. this is a negotiation that has been in progress. that said, with respect to the part of the request dealing specifically with s. 789, the respect act, i am willing to let that go. but if the request is to pass both of these by unanimous consent, i cannot support that, and on that basis, i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the senator from hawaii. mr. schatz. mr. president, a couple of points. on taking 55.3 acres into trust, this is not like the federal government is going to have new land management responsibilities. this is a matter of principle for the senator from utah, and i recognize that; that he thinks, basically, no additional land should be taken into trust, even though this government-to-government relationship--this authority over these government relationships are enshrined in the constitution of the united states and this government-to-government relationship has already been established by statutory law and the process for putting land into trust is already a well-established pathway. but what the senator from utah is saying is no more or we are going to have to do a one-for-one swap or even sometimes a two-for-one swap. you cannot have a net increase in the acreage, even if it is 53 acres, even if there is an established process. and so, i do find that difficult to work with. i know that the senators from arizona are in discussions with the senator from utah. we will find our way forward. this is 53 acres. it is important, obviously. we are going to enact this legislation. i like the senator from utah. we will find a way on this one. but if he would entertain an amendment to the request, then i
