after republicans cut snap, hayes, craig, luján fight to restore $187 billion in food assistance november 20 , 2025 washington, d.c. – today, ranking member of the subcommittee on nutrition and foreign agriculture, congresswoman jahana hayes (ct-05) was joined by house committee on agriculture ranking member angie craig (mn-02) and ranking member of the senate agriculture committee subcommittee on food and nutrition, specialty crops, organics, and research, senator ben ray luján (d-nm) , to introduce the restoring food security for american families and farmers act of 2025 to repeal the devastating cuts to the supplemental nutrition program (snap) in the one big beautiful. forty-two million americans, including sixteen million children, rely on snap. in july 2025, republicans forced through the one big beautiful bill, which eliminated $187 billion from snap, the largest cut in the history of the program, and provided over $1 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest americans and the largest corporations. as a result, millions of children, seniors, veterans, workers, and those with disabilities and chronic health conditions will be blocked from snap, the most effective anti-hunger program in the country. these drastic cuts will negatively impact farmers, ranchers, producers and the 250,000 grocers authorized to accept snap dollars. every dollar in snap benefits generates $1.54 in economic activity. additionally, slashing federal snap funding creates a massive unfunded mandate on state governments, requiring them to make the toughest choices and harshest cuts. states across the country could be forced to end snap entirely if they are unable to come up with the funds to fill the gaps left by federal cuts. “at every opportunity, republicans have chosen to target and decimate the programs that feed people. the big beautiful bill implemented the largest cut to snap in history – putting the most vulnerable at higher risk of hunger,” said ranking member hayes. “republicans have proven that cruelty is the point. during the government shutdown, all of america watched as they once again chose to use hunger as a weapon and blocked emergency funding for snap – marking the first ever lapse in funding. with the restoring food security for american families and farmers act we can reverse the damage caused by this legislation and restore the nearly $200 billion eliminated from snap.” the food research & action center (frac) and the center on budget policy priorities were joined by more than 1,440 organizations nationwide, including 24 from connecticut in a letter of support of the restoring food security for american families and farmers act . additional supporters provided the following to offer their endorsement of the legislation: “connecticut foodshare distributes 45 million meals annually across the state of connecticut and we cannot do the work that we do without snap. the program offers dignity, choice and stability. we enthusiastically support congresswoman hayes in her efforts to restore this important program for the people that we serve,” said jason jakubowski, president & ceo, connecticut foodshare. “the big, ugly bill is truly robin hood in reverse. it’s implementing the largest cut to domestic food assistance in u.s. history, literally taking food out of the mouths of the country’s most vulnerable children, seniors, people with disabilities, limited-income working people, and veterans – all in order to pay for massive tax cuts that would disproportionately benefit millionaires and billionaires. this cut to food assistance will also devastate hundreds of thousands of food businesses nationwide. this bill's reversal of those cuts is both common sense and basic morality. we thank rep. hayes for leading on this,” said joel berg, ceo of hunger free america , a nonpartisan, nonprofit direct service and advocacy organization. “the recent republican cuts to the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap) are a stunning abandonment of the tens of millions of americans experiencing food insecurity today. at mazon, our faith demands that no one go hungry, and we firmly believe our federal government is responsible for ensuring the basic needs of all americans are met. we strongly support this legislation to reverse the damage to snap and corresponding harm to american families, and we urge congress to take up this measure at once,” said abby j. leibman, president & ceo of mazon: a jewish response to hunger. congressional co-leaders of the restoring food security for american families and farmers act shared the following: “president trump has spent his first year in office repeatedly attacking our nation’s most effective anti-hunger program at a time when his tariffs are contributing to record food prices. his big ugly bill cut snap – a basic needs food assistance program – by $187 billion, taking food away from millions of hungry american seniors, children, people with disabilities and veterans. i encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for our vulnerable neighbors and help to pass the restoring food security for american families and farmers act,” said ranking member craig. “for half a century, our nation has stood behind a bipartisan promise: that no child, no senior, no veteran, and no working family should go hungry. republicans broke that promise and ripped meals away from millions of americans in their budget betrayal. snap puts food on the table for 42 million people – including one in every five new mexicans – yet the trump administration spent the shutdown trying to block families from receiving food assistance and make it as difficult as possible to access their benefits. we have a responsibility to protect these families. that’s why i am leading congressional democrats in introducing legislation to fully repeal the republican cuts to snap and ensure no american family goes hungry,” said senator luján . “from gutting snap in their big beautiful betrayal of a bill to refusing to provide food assistance to families in need during the shutdown, this administration has taken every opportunity to make it harder for americans to put food on the table,” said senator klobuchar , ranking member of the senate committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry. “with this legislation, we will keep fighting every step of the way to restore food assistance to families in need and ensure the 42 million americans — including veterans, seniors and children — who count on snap don’t go to bed hungry.” the house legislation is cosponsored by representatives: angie craig (mn-02), alma s. adams (nc-12), gabe amo (ri-01), yassamin ansari (az-03), becca balint (vt), nanette
