hayes statement on republican-led continuing resolution september 19 , 2025 washington — today, congresswoman jahana hayes (ct-05) released the following statement on the fiscal year 2026 continuing resolution (cr): “today, i voted no on the house republican funding bill, which was a continuation of the same bill i voted against earlier this year. this legislation paves the way for nearly $1 trillion in healthcare cuts that will kick 15 million americans off their insurance, with premiums expected to rise by over 75 percent. “the cr continues the cuts to veterans benefits, healthcare programs, rent subsidies, and food and nutrition programs that i rejected earlier this year. “moreover, this legislation was drafted with no bipartisan input, ignoring the urgent needs of families in the fifth district already struggling with the rising cost of living from the policies of the current administration. “i remain committed to working on finding solutions and will not settle for partisan legislation which raises costs and continues to decimate programs. the health and financial security of millions are on the line. i urge the senate to reject this bill and prioritize the needs of the american people.” ### permalink:
