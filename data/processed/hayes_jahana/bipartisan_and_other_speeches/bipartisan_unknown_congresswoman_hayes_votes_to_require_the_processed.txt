congresswoman hayes votes to require the department of justice (doj) release the entire epstein files november 18 , 2025 washington, d.c. – today, congresswoman jahana hayes (ct-05) issued the following statement after the vote on h.r. 4405, the epstein files transparency act: “my vote on this legislation was an easy yes, because simply put, anyone who participated in, had knowledge of this depravity, or worked to cover up the abuse of young women should be brought to justice. the vote today was necessary because president trump, the department of justice and house republicans have blocked the release of the epstein files for months in committee, refused to comply with subpoenas and attempted to stall a discharge petition signed by 218 members of congress. more than eighty percent of americans believe these files should be released. victims deserve full recognition, the public deserves full disclosure, and history demands the truth. while today’s vote does not provide the justice these women deserve, it is my hope that it provides some healing, comfort and accountability for the survivors of this heinous abuse." permalink:
