uh kentucky had the unfortunate distinction until yesterday of being the only state in the south with a democratic legislative body that changed dramatically yesterday as the republicans in the bluegrass state took the state house by defeating 17 democrats went from 47 up to 64 um it' been almost as long as the uh it had been since the cub has won the world series 95 years of continuous uh democratic control so that only added a little more um happiness to my uh evening uh to more current and national matters i senor schumer call yesterday and um offered his cooperation and i said that is certainly what i intended to do and we talked again today and that is still the view of both of us that we want to work together and see what we can accomplish uh for the american people not only in the uh in the lame duck but beginning next year also have had a chance to talk to president the vice president both of whom called uh to president-elect trump and to vice president-elect pence uh all today um not only just offering congratulations where appropriate but in the case of the president talk about wrapping up uh business uh this year i am really proud of the races that we won um if you look across the country u as all of you know we had a lot of exposure 24 of us up only 10 of our democrat friends um in a day when the american people clearly were expressing themselves for major change uh in the vote for president it is noteworthy that only one or maybe two senate incumbants were defeated so i think an appropriate way to look at the senate races 18 of the senate candidates actually ran ahead of the uh presidential uh candidate in other races somewhat behind kind of a mixed picture uh but i think in a day when people were voting for change they did not decide they wanted to change the republican senate which i am proud of and of course many of our members actually had bipartisan accomplishments to run on as distinguished for example from the previous congress where senator beage from alaska had never been able to allow and never had been allowed to even offer an amendment on a on a bill in a whole six-year term we open the senate up we gave people an opportunity to express themselves to offer their ideas in the case of several of our members there were important accomplishments for their states that they were able to talk about during the course of the campaign want to particularly congratulate president-elect trump i think we all agree this is a stunning election and clearly an indication the american people would like to try something new and i know the speaker shares my view that we would like to see the country go in a different direction and intend to work with him to change courses uh to change the course uh for america he will have an opportunity to fill the supreme court vacancy as you know i said in february of this year to a hail of controversy that i thought it best that the american people decide who made this appointment to the supreme court i thought i was on pretty firm footing and doing that it had been 80 years since a vacancy created in the middle of a presidential election year was confirmed by the senate you would have to go back to 1888 to find the last time a vacancy on the supreme court in the middle of a presidential election year was confirmed by senate of the opposite party of the president and so the american people have spoken and president trump will send us a nominee i assume early next year so with that let me just throw it open and see what you would like to discuss yeah mr leader um considering how uh republicans blocked meric garland here uh there is ever been an outright filibuster of a supreme court justice we have the a for a situation that is a little bit different why would you expect democrats to handle any nomination from president-elect trump any differently and if they do block it would you expect to return the favor with the nuclear option on supreme court justices well it will not surprise you to know i am not going to address what might happen in the context of a supreme court appointment what we do know is the the new president will fill the vacancy and um i expect it to be handled um in the way these court appointments are typically handled and i would not anticipate any particular strategy in that the democrats might employ uh to uh defeat it or what we might do in reaction to that did you bring that up with senator schumer today no we have not discussed do you think comprehensive tax reform is possible next year and what are some of your other legislative priorities well we are going to be working with the new president on legislative priorities but he talked about tax reform and as some of you know um i think this is really important um in the early part of my service in the senate we did the comprehensive tax reform back in 1986 and um president reagan and democratic speaker tip o'neal had an agreement that it would be revenue neutral to the government and to the maxim extent possible try to make america more competitive by lowering the rates for as many as possible possible president obama and i and i know he had this conversation i am sure with speaker boehner and speaker ryan as well talked about it the president the current president was not interested in making it revenue neutral to the government in other words he wanted to get more money for the government if we want to make america truly competitive the goal ought to be when revenue is produced by the elimination of preferences use that to buy down the rates we have a particular acute problem with a corporate tax rate as everyone admits thereby creating the opportunity for inversions and the like and what i would prefer to see and i have not had a chance to talk to the president about this yet is comprehensive tax reform that does not just lower taxes for the corporations who are having a hard time competing with the rest of the world but for most american businesses which are not corporations they are either es corps or llc's and so we need to have an agreement on what we are advocating and um back in those days when we did it the last time there were plenty of democrats on board for it bill bradley was a key player in it and hopefully that is the kind of thing we are going to have some bipartisan agreement on and actually make some progress to the country senator m senat m you have talked before about how in 2018 republicans have a very favorable map um it is very likely that you will have the majority through until your own next election in 2020 are you starting to think about what kind of legacy you will have or what kind of stamp you can make on america with these next four years no we have not even started the next congress yet there'll be plenty of time to talk about legacies later send call yeah um i wondered if you had a preference for how long you would like to fund the government that is going to come up in about a month would you want to go uh cr just until trump takes over or are you thinking an omnibus what is what is your where is your head at on that really have not talked about that uh there are two priorities it seems to me for the lame dug the issue raised how how are you going to fund the government and second excuse me second the 21st century cures bill the president's interested in precision medicine part of that the vice president's interested in the cancer moonshot part of it i am interested in the regenerative medicine part of it c alexander and uh chairman upton have done terrific work on this i would like to see us finish that important new measure this year and the president and i discussed those two matters um this morning uh in june you expressed uh concerns about donald trump uh his comments about hispanics and potentially harming the republican party's relationship with hispanics similar l goldwater did with african-americans i am wondering after last night after this campaign do you still share those concerns you still have those concerns number one and number two do you support his central policy idea to build a wall on the border with mexico well i am not going to go back and relitigate the events of the past we have a new president i would like for him to see get off on a positive start and i think we should look forward and not backward and kind of rehash and relitigate the various debates we had both internally and the democrats over the past year what about the wall that is that is a c we are going to be talking to the president about his agenda border security is important i think even our democratic friends realize we have not done a very good job of that and u achieving border security is something i think ought to be high on the uh list do you have a pref personal preference on the wall i i i want to try to achieve border security in whatever way is the most effective go senator uh do the election results signal an end to the war on coal which you talked about and if so how does that affect your agenda in the next congress and what does that mean for coal jobs in kentucky well you know the uh the war on coal is not a result of any legislation we passed here one of the things i hope the new president he mentioned this during the campaign will do is take a look at all of the unilateral actions that the president took both through executive orders and regulatory u overreach of one kind or another and the coal industry is a perfect example of that there were a lot of others uh and see how much he can undo of the unilateral actions the president took all by himself which would not require us um so i think in looking at why the countries had such slow growth the most tepid recovery after a deep recession since world war two overregulation is the principal reason why i am pretty conf confident the president did not have one year of 3% growth and you saw a whole lot of people who voted for the new president yesterday frustrated they might not have put it this way but the lack of growth is the reason for the lack of opportunity and jobs we got to get this economy going again we got to take our foot off the break and put it on the accelerator and much of that can be done by the president alone because much of the problem has been created by this president alone so we will be working with the administ ation to make suggestions about what kind of unilateral action he can take to undo some of this regulatory overreach which has slowed the economy so much and and cole is a good example that can you characterize how you see the senate majority's relationship with president-elect trump is it to be a partner is it to be a facilitator of his agenda and do you think he shares your perception of the role of a senate majority in his coming term well i know he is really happy he is we still have a republican majority and uh we look forward to working with him i think most of the things that he is likely to advocate we are going to be enthusiastically for where we have differences of opinion i expect to discuss them privately and not sort of hashing them out in public but the goal will be to try to get on the same page to try to turn the country in a different direction look we have had a tutorial here over the last eight years a big government taxes regulation big debts we know what does not work you do all of this stuff you get slow growth so in order to get the country going again we need to undo much of that and the good news is a lot of it was done by the president by himself so we are going to i think be enthusiastically supportive almost all the time and where we have differences we will talk about them privately and see if we can work them out senator mcconnell senat mn senat mcconnell what is your plan on healthcare going forward do you plan on repealing obamacare right away it is a pretty high item on our agenda as you know and um i would be shocked if we did not u move forward to keep our commitment to the american people it was the single worst piece of legislation among many bad pieces of legislation uh passed in the first two years of the obama presidency the sooner we can go in a different direction the better specific t any chance that comes up in the lan duck any chance that comes up under president trump well you have to ask him but tpa is still in place if the next president wants to negotiate trade agreements he has the opportunity to do that and to send it up exting framework that president obama has negotiated do you think it is that it is certainly not going to be brought up this year yeah and it' be up to discussions with the new president as you know i think president le made it pretty clear he was not in favor of the current agreement but he has the latitude because tpa is in place through the next administration to negotiate better deals as i think he would put it if he chooses to and sending them up to us for an expedited up or down vote yeah in september you and speaker ryan both said you wanted to move spending bills on series of mini buses did the does the election outcome change that plan at all how you plan to move the appropriations measures in well we will be talking with a speaker and with the president about how to wrap up the spending this year you are asking me a procedural question i do not blame you for asking it but i do not know the answer to it right now we would like to finish funding the government this year exactly how to achieve that over a three-week period is always a matter for discussion how to package it um differences in the house versus the senate but i would like to wrap up the business of funding the government in this fiscal year this calendar year um going back to the affordable care act do you plan to use budget reconciliation for the repeal and replacement or do you plan to reach out to senator you are asking me a question you know i am not going to answer all of that is underway i i think let us just stipulate that every single republican thought obamacare was a mist stake without exception that is still our view and you can expect us with a new president who has the same view to address that issue do you expect to support uh president-elect trump's stated goals of withdrawing from nato and forging a closer alliance with russia yeah look i again that is sort of like manu's question sort of go back and relitigate various things that were said during the past year i want to look forward i will say for myself i think the nato alliance is every bit as important today as it ever was i think article 5 means something you attack any member of nato you have us to deal with i want the russians to understand that fully pa senator uh in the last time there was a unified control of the white house the senate and the house your belief was that the democrats in 20091 acted too fast on their own unilaterally with no real b bipartisanship on stimulus uh aca dodf frank how do you avoid those mistakes given the the views of your voters republican based voters right now well let me just answer it sort of broadly i think it is always a mistake to misread your mandate and frequently new majorities think it is going to be forever nothing is forever in this country we have an election every two years right on schedule we have had since 1788 and so uh i do not think we should act as if we are going to be in the majority forever we we have been given a temporary lease on power if you will and i think we need to use it responsibly i think what the american people are looking for is results and to get results in the senate as all of you know it requires some democratic participation and cooperation uh we were able to do that during the first obama tenure and the deals for example that i negotiated with biden on three different occasions and um we are going to be looking for bipartisan support and i think uh overreaching after an election is generally speaking a mistake mcconnell uh one of the items that has been on president elect's agenda has been congressional term limits which my memory is is not something something that you have been a particular fan of uh what would you say to whether or not that would have any uh chance of daylight i say we have ter limits now they are called elections and it will not be on the agenda in the senate senator yeah any chance that um now that republicans control all the you know aspects of the government then you might reconsider the earmark ban or moror i do not think so senator mell when you talk about bipar issues criminal justice reform is something that has support on both sides of the aisle do you think that that is something you could look at in a new congress donald trump has not talked about it much he is talked about law and order but he has not waited specifically on any other legislation well in terms of scheduling in the senate as i think you already know we have some pretty serious divisions among republicans on that i would not rule it out um i do not want to uh speak for the speaker but i he is he is he is said something about whether or not they might tackle it um so that might be a good question to ask him um if they send a bill over to us we will take a good hard look at it but but it is a pretty spirited debate within uh our conference and we have really not on a philosophical basis i have some very conservative members who are in favor of it and who are opposed to it so it did not look to me like a good agenda item for us at this point but i would not want to rule it out for next congress senator yeah senator m back to the supreme court issue could you just help us understand how much advising and how much consenting you will be doing well i i was really pleased that the president elect was already asking for our advice as you know many of us made suggestions when he put together a list of prospective nominees he was in effect asking for our advice and i think he will be open to that and i for one intend to take advantage of it i have got a few suggestions i would like to make that i will not mention to you but i you know i think i think he is open to our suggestions about that and i think that is good i think it is the way it ought work yeah ty you uh mentioned a few things in the lan like you did not mention uh tax extenders is that an issue that will be in play over the next few weeks or two you know i we you know i i am not sure we are doing extenders are we i do not know the answer to that that is the best answer when you do not know just say you do not know yeah um you and senator re have been famously at l heads for years now we both like bryce harper we both pull for the nets and we were both sad that the gats did not make it past the first round again and i am with you on all this could i just ask you though to expand on your thought on your relationship with senator schumer and you expected different relationship um what sort of does he bring to the table that you maybe can work with or will be trouble area yeah look i i think we are getting along f i know you you guys like to write these personality pieces he is he is got a job to do and i got a job to do i i respect him i think he is very smart and um i i think we will be fine we we both have our roles to play i do not expect him to enthusiastically embrace my agenda on the other hand um to do things in the senate you have to have some bipartisan support unless you are like the democrats in 09 and 10 with 60 votes and then they paid a big price for it two years later which sort of gets back to paul's uh question earlier senor mell can you describe your relationship with governor pence and do you expect him to be kind of a chief lea on to capitol hill given his govern well we all really like u mike pence i if you have asked any of us who have served with him everybody likes him we all thought it was a great choice that uh president-elect trump made and picking him i would just mention the way vice president cheney worked with us uh he he was at many of our tuesday lunches and you know dick cheney was a classic guy who did not necessarily say anything all the time but he was like a sponge absorbing um what our concerns were and he he acted almost like president bush is senate le aison and i am i have mentioned that to vice president pence and i hope he will uh attend our tuesday policy lunches when he is in town and uh kind of be our liaison between the administration and the senate much like vice president cheney was yeah um regarding the majority uh keeping the majority uh the senate leadership fund said that when the democrats started to to raise a lot of money and put them in these competitive senate races that you personally quote set up a flare sent up a flare to republican donors to try to raise some more money for the for the effort to keep the majority can you tell me a little bit well you know what i did was to call people's attention around the country call their attention to the fact that this group existed it was obviously operated by people that that i have known well for years and i knew what their purpose was because they announced it their purpose was to try to help us uh keep uh the republican senate so sure i i praised them and um made sure everybody was aware of their existence what was the key moment though when did you feel like you had to start i do not know that it was a key moment uh i recommended that that this group be set up which is about all i could do legally recomend represented they be set up a couple of years ago because i felt like there was no sort of outside group grp that was sort of looking out for us like the senate majority pack was looking out for the democrats there are a lot of entrepreneurs on the right groups you have all read about and written about you know all from my point of view doing good stuff but nobody was completely focused on the senate and so i was pleased that they came into existence and i think all indications are they made a difference you mentioned that uh you think that there is a lot of executive orders and regulatory act that the uh new president will get rid of specifically on the climate plan the clean power plan do you think that he will just drop that court case or what is your expectation and what would you advise them to do that would sure be my hope i mean right away or what is your that would sure be my hope day one would be a good idea yeah what do you say to um undocumented immigrants in a country right now who might be uncertain about what their futures are with donald trump elected president yeah i am i am not going to discuss the immigration issue today um we will be discussing that internally with the new administration uh in the coming coming months i am going to take one more yeah uh so president-elect trump did not win the popular vote as it looks like now um a does he have a mandate and b what do he the mandate to do well we have been there before you know that happened in 2000 and the american people understand that if you you get 270 electoral votes you are president and i would like to compliment vice president gore you know he conceded he did not run around saying we ought to amend the constitution to get rid of the electoral college he accepted the results of the system that we have and uh secretary clinton did the same thing to accredit this morning so the election is over we know who won and we going to move on from there and do the best we can for the american people thanks a lot everybody
