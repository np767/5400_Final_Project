press releases mcconnell statement on ukraine november 21 , 2025 washington, d.c. – u.s. senator mitch mcconnell (r-ky), chairman of the senate appropriations defense subcommittee, released the following statement today: “putin has spent the entire year trying to play president trump for a fool. if administration officials are more concerned with appeasing putin than securing real peace, then the president ought to find new advisors. rewarding russian butchery would be disastrous to america’s interests. and a capitulation like biden’s abandonment of afghanistan would be catastrophic to a legacy of peace through strength.” permalink: press releases audio statements video statements newsletters photo galleries
