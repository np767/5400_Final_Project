here we go. mr. gatelle. of mr. patel and all the people that are here to observe. this is our annual fbi oversight hearing. we meet today in the aftermath of the political assassination of charlie kirk, a school shooting and the senseless murder of ukrainian refugees and also to remember several weeks ago the killings in minnesota. charlie kirk was a man of god, faith, family, and country. a pray for his wife, erica, children, the whole family. god bless you, charlie kirk. i have asked director patel for an update today on this matter. as we proceed with the hearing, dr. patel, director patel, i would like to note that you have agreed to one ten men around of questioning. that is more time than your predecessor agreed to. when director ray appeared before this committee, he left early to go on a family vacation and he wanted me to think it was business he had to conduct. since your confirmation, you have been acquainted with the bureaucracy that you must reform and hold accountable and that is no simple task. you have begun the important work of returning the fbi to its law enforcement mission. according to the fbi, since january 20th of this year, the fbi has been involved in the arrest of more than 23,000 violent criminals. this year the fbi assisted the arrest of more than 1500 child predators and 300 human traffickers. and this year the fbi helped rescue more than 4,000 children from predators. fbi teams nationwide are working alongside immigration and custom enforcement. this teamwork has resulted in the arrest and removal of a historic number of violent criminal aliens, gang members and child sex offenders. those are all more well-winged better records than at least two of your past predecessors. during the ray era at the fbi, the bureau reallocated resources from child crimes to january 6th work. director patel, you have also moved agents from headquarters to field offices to better assign a line with their enforcement mission. under your leadership, the fbi has apprehended several most wanted fugitives and secured the extradition of senior leaders of the central american gangs like ms-13. now well it is well understood that your predecessor left you and fbi infected with politics. i am going to provide examples of that today including making public new whistleblower records. at your nomination hearing, i made public records that whistleblowers provide me about arctic frost. arctic frost was the fbi case opened and approved by anti-truths trump fbi agent t-bolt. arctic frost then became jack smith's electric case against then citizen trump and now president trump. these new records show that arctic frost was much broader than just an electoral matter. the case was expanded to republican organizations. some examples of the group that ray fbi sought to place under political investigation included the republican national committee, republican attorney general's association and various trump political groups. in total, 92 republican targets including republican groups and republican linked individuals were placed under investigative sculpt of arctic frost. on that political list was one of charlie kirk's groups turning point usa. in other words, arctic frost was not just a case to politically investigate trump. it was the vehicle by which partisan fbi agents and department of justice prosecutors could achieve their partisan ends and improperly investigate the entire republican political apparatus. so today senator johnson and i are making these records public for the entire country to see and i hope a lot of people are interested in seeing what government can do when various agencies have a political agenda. my investigative work has also exposed the political way in which peter navarro was investigated and prosecuted. when fbi agent t-bolt found out that biden's doj would prosecute navarro, he said, wow great that is a quote unquote. through whistleblowers, i have attained a audio recording of special agent geogardina and special agent sebastian gardner's delivery of a subpoena to navarro. i am making that audio audio public today in a court document filed by the department of justice. navarro's interaction with the fbi was unfairly described as quote unquote the word combative. that intervention with navarro was just as the justification to later aggressively arrest him. then we get to the clinton annex and the durham annex. the clinton annex showed that the komi fbi had evidence necessary to complete the clinton investigation. the one about her misunderstanding of emails and classified information but the fbi never did its job because it never reviewed the evidence at that time. the durban annex showed that the clinton campaign had a plan to falsely tie trump to russia, yet the komi fbi failed to investigate that information. instead the komi fbi used the discredited clinton campaign funded steel dossier to advance crossfire hurricane against trump, director patel. thanks in a large part to you both annexes were finally declassified. that may be history but it is history to make sure we do not repeat the history of the past and the people ought to be concerned when the weaponization of government is used in this way whether it is done by republicans or democrats. last congress i made public an fbi document called 1023-4 that alleged a bribery scheme with the biden family. today the fbi has never answered congress whether they investigated the text messages, the audio files and the financial records referenced in that 1023. whistleblowers have provided my office with two additional fbi 1023 documents. these documents memorialize statements from fbi sources. these two new 1023 documents are from separate fbi confidential human sources during different years. so in total we now have three different fbi confidential human sources providing information about the biden family and potential criminal conduct. today senator johnson and i are releasing these records. let me say this for the partisan media the people that are supposed to be policemen of our republican form of government. we are not saying the allegations are true. we want to know what the fbi did to fully investigate their veracity or lack thereof and what they concluded. let us put this matter to rest one way or the other. starting with my championship i have given one example after another of disgraceful partisan weaponization by federal law enforcement. since the trump administration took power many fbi agents have been removed. the removal included agents and prosecutors who became partisan weapons that lost their way and i have made records public to prove it and many of my whistleblowers were aggressively retaliated against by some fbi agents who were subsequently fired. one fbi whistleblower publicly said of these terminations quote ensuring that they no longer work at the fbi is not rectorbusion. it is responsible leadership and a quote which brings me to my final and favorite topic whistleblowers. in august 10 of my whistle 10 of my fbi whistleblowers secured compensation agreement because of your leadership director patel. it included a mix of reinstatement of the to the fbi reinstatement of security clearances and monetary compensation. at the beginning of this month another of my fbi whistleblowers got their job back all told across government agencies almost 20 whistleblowers have received fixes to their retaliation. today you will get a lot of grief from some members of this committee but in in the short amount of time you have been director you have corrected whistleblower retaliation increased transparency more than any other fbi director i have seen whether that fbi director was appointed by republicans or democrats and i have been around here more than anybody else on this committee. i yield to senator droomit. thanks chairman grassley for holding the silverside hearing during a critical period in the history of the federal bureau of investigation. during my four years as chair i held four hearings within fbi director ray as a reminder to republicans who claim the biden administration weaponized the fbi president biden retained director ray a lifelong republican who was president trump's nominee for the office. after his second election in an unprecedented move president trump forced out director ray and nominated cash patel arguably the most partisan fbi director ever. director patel came to the fbi with a political mission and he spelled it out in writing in detail. he wrote government gangsters quote the rot at the core of the fbi is not just scandalous it is an existential threat to our republican former government in quote and with the power of his office and the blessings of the president he attacked the fbi with a vengeance. mr. patel had falsely claimed the fbi quote was planning january 6 for a year in quote even what so far as to produce a song by the january 6 rioters who violently assaulted police officers in the capital. he compiled an enemy's list of public servants he called government gangsters like former fbi director mueller who mattel called quote an utter swamp creature. former trump officials who served with mr. patel warned us he would weaponize the fbi to protect the president's allies and target his critics and indeed director patel is already inflicted untold damage on the fbi putting our national security and public safety at risk. since january 20th the trump administration has engaged in an unprecedented purge of fbi officials as we heard from highly credible whistleblowers mr. patel was involved in directing this purge even before he was confirmed despite his sworn testimony to this committee. it began with terminations and forced retirements of all six nonpartisan career officials who run all six branches of the fbi the executive assistant director. since then at least 18 of the 53 special agents in charge of fbi field offices had been removed along with many other senior officials. individual agents have been targeted for termination simply due to the work that they were assigned such as january 6th investigation. in fact according to former acting fbi director brian disco in a lawsuit filed last week director patel made this very plain telling driscoe personally quote that his own job depended on the removal of agents who worked on the cases against the president and quote and even though he knew quote the nature nature of summary findings were likely illegal. at the same time director patel has installed mega loyalist as political appointees and key career positions including conspiracy theorist dan bongino as fbi deputy director the first time in the history of the fbi that this position has not been held by a career fbi agent. director patel is also reportedly initiated loyalty test loyalty test requiring dozens of officials to sit for polygraph exams and answer inappropriate questions about whether they have made negative comments about him personally. of course this is often the case in the trump administration the rules applied to the but not to me as we understand it from highly credible sources key members of director patel senior executive team and others on the 7th floor had disqualifying alerts on their initial polygraph exam well how do they survive they survive because of personal waiver by either the director or the attorney general to remain employed by the bureau. get the understand the context here political operatives in key positions given the routine fbi on polygram exam failed and had to receive waivers to continue their positions they were lucky to keep their political appointments they were but the 5,000 career civil servants the director is so far forced out of the bureau's ranks were not offered that same courtesy. 5,000 this mass accidents has created a disastrous brain drain particularly in the fields of cyber security counterterrorism counterintelligence for example my office has received information indicating that cuts to the bureau's cyber division will cut personnel by half despite the ever increasing threats posed by adverse foreign actors the brain drain is exacerbated by director patel's misuse of remaining fbi personnel resources to focus on other priorities of this administration according to reports the 25 largest fbi field offices have been ordered to divert 45% of their agents from their primary missions to work on the mass deportation of immigrants just as concerning as director patel's plan to hire fewer qualified agents by removing the college decree degree requirement and reducing new agent training at quantico from 18 weeks to just eight so we have a brain drain and a significant watered orring down of training quite a record mr. patel has recently fired special agents and others of war and fast tracking inexperienced and improperly trained people into critical national security jeopardizes the bureau's ability to effectively protect america director patel himself had no training or life experience for this position the result of that incompetence is staggering for example after attorney general bondy publicly stated in february that the epstein client list was quote sitting on my desk right now to review that is what you said on fox director patel diverted more than a thousand fbi personnel from their critical missions to work on 24 irish shifts reviewing over a hundred thousand pages of epstein related records these personnel were instructed to flag any records in which president trump was named but that review ended in unsigned memorandum from doj and fbi stating simply there is no incriminating client list close quote director patel still has not responded to my letter from two months ago asking about his rule and his cover up on the day of the horrific shooting of charlie kirk at utah valley university director patel again sparked mass confusion by incorrectly claiming on social media that the shooter was in custody which he then had to walk back with another social media post mr. patel was so anxious to take credit for finding mr. kirk's assassin that he violated one of the basics of effective law enforcement at critical stages of an investigation shut up and let the professionals do their job notably director patel recently forced on special agent charge at salt lake city my amsaid a counterterrorism expert with 20 years experience who would have led this high-profile investigation the men and women who served at the fbi and the american people deserve a director who has the ability and the character to restore the bureau to its place as the preeminent law enforcement agency i want to close on a personal note i came of age in the 1960s we experienced a number of horrific assassinations including president john kennedy senator robert kennedy and dr. martin luther king we are going through a similar period of division and political violence all of us in public life on both sides of the aisle have a responsibility to bring down the temperature and to work to unite the american people let us be clear republicans are not nazis and democrats are not evil as mr. patel is claimed democrats are not responsible for the murder of charlie kirk and republicans are not responsible for the murder of melissa hartman our political opponents are not our enemies we are all americans and we should be working together to keep the american people safe and protect their constitutional rights thank you mr. chairman would you please stand so i could do you do you affirm that the testimony you are about to give before this committee will be the truth the whole truth or nothing but the truth so i hope you guide please be seated and you can give your statement now thank you good morning mr. chairman ranking member durbin and members of the committee it is an honor to be here with you today as the ninth director of the fbi i want to provide by providing briefing into the tragic assassination of charlie kirk it is important that this fbi is transparent as possible without jeopardizing investigations charlie kirk was shot at 12.23 a.m. excuse me pm on september 10th i think this timeline is critically important less than a day later the fbi my direction released the first set of images of the suspect that we captured based on our analysis on the ground later that evening while conducting extensive interviews and cell phone analysis and also flying out evidence response teams and hostage rescue teams and evidence tacticians who were collecting evidence in live time and flying them back to washington dc in our laboratories for immediate analysis we were able to extract video from the campus feed and at my direction at 8 p.m. in partnership and promise to working with the public to bring this fugitive to justice we released a newly never beats never before seen video of the suspect we also released new enhanced photos of the suspect a few hours later that suspect was in custody pursuant to the interrogation of the suspects on father who stated when i saw that video that you released i recognized it was my son and i confronted him and he was handed over to lawful law enforcement authorities that is the fbi working with the public as a promise to being transparent and provided critical information along the way in the manhunt for the suspect and suspects involved in charlie's assassination we received over 11,000 tips in the first 24 hours alone we received 16,000 submissions to our digital media enterprise and tip lines that is a large number of material to go through i want to thank president trump and attorney general pam bondi for their unwavering support and commitment resources to this and all investigations i also want to especially thank our colleagues in utah governor's office dps and the sheriff's out there state and local law enforcement partnership has been a cornerstone since i took over at the fbi and it was no different here and our teams in salt lake city or sacs out there across the country our lab tacticians in quantico who race to complete the evidence analysis so the public could have the answers they need these people worked through the night without sleep for days on end there to be commended they are not to be attacked and many many many more people i do not have time to thank here today but i do want to thank the american people especially the mission of the fbi is for them and with them and by within through them and is that mission and that ethos that i brought to this investigation and so many others and that is why that suspect is in custody we cannot do our job without the american public incredible reporting in the media and that is why tyler robinson is in custody today about to face charges the last time i appeared before this committee was in january for my confirmation hearing i told you then that if i were confirmed i would provide and do everything i can to provide a safe and secure america i promise to provide the courageous men and women the fbi the tools and resources they need to crush violent crime and defend the homeland i pledge myself to commit to full transparency oversight and accountability so we could restore the public's trust in the fbi that is exactly what i have done under this administration the fbi's arrested more than 23,000 violent criminals that is more than twice for the same time period from last year alone 23,000 more than twice from the same time period last year we have taken over over 6,000 illegal firearms off the streets that number is an exponential increase we have identified and located more than 4,700 child victims more than 4,700 child victims have been found by this fbi that is a 35% increase from the same time period last year 1500 child predators have been arrested that is a 5% increase from the same time last year 300 human traffickers have been arrested that is a 10% increase from the same time last year over 350 members of trendy oragua far and terrorist organization have been arrested and we have 42 ongoing cases that is a 250% increase from the same time last year those are just some of the things the fbi is doing differently and better because we are leading the mission of crush violent crime and defend the homeland we have also arrested four captured four top 10 fugitives from the fbi's top 10 most wanted list to put that in perspective that is the same amount i have captured in seven months that my predecessor did during the entirety of the biden administration those are real results and the credit is to the men and women at the fbi we have been able to achieve these results because the fbi recognizes violent crime does not just happen in washington dc that is why one of my first decisions as a director was to get the people the bureaus professional staff out to the field and we have done that with great speed in every single one of your districts and states has received a plus up of fbi personnel agents and special operators to the tune of almost a thousand we did that because crime had unexpectedly and unacceptably exploded across the country in fact one of the stats that the american people should thank the fbi the most for is we are on track to have the lowest murder rate in modern american history the lowest murder rate by double digit percentages a major factor in the drop of this violent crime is the fbi's flagship operation summer heat we use this initiative at the direction of the president the attorney general surging resources to a major and mid-major cities across america conducting intelligence-based operations to target the worst of the worst to target the gangs to target the transnational organizations to target the tcos and to target the drug trafficking cartels and we have taken them out city by city there is a lot of work left to be done but we are off to a great start just ask the citizens of seattle miami memphis charlotte chicago in so many more places specifically new orleans and nashville alone there has been an increase in the number of violent crime arrests by an average of 250 percent for each of those cities and there has been a drastic reduction in crime across the board in mid-major cities across this country thanks the men and women of the fbi how are we doing that we are attacking the drug of a dynamic we have seized nearly a thousand kilograms of meth and cocaine off the streets of america we have taken over 1600 1600 kilograms of fentanyl off the streets maybe one of the greatest achievements we have this year 1600 kilograms of fentanyl that is a 25 percent increase from the same time last year to put things in perspective that is enough fentanyl to kill a third of the american populace 115 million americans we are also going after the companies that manufacture these precursors overseas in places like mainland china and and their cutting agents in fact this month in cincinnati we announced groundbreaking charges aimed at the individuals and businesses responsible for flooding these opioids and their precursors and cutting agents into the streets of america and for the first time that i can remember we are charging these businesses and enterprises not just in america but in mainland china and seizing their operational necessity to have money by seizing their cryptocurrency wallets we are also equally important to protecting the homeland we know we have a no-fail mission we are committed to keeping our nation safe from terrorism cyber attacks and foreign adversaries whether stopping threats inspired by foreign terrorist organizations or lone wolf factors sponsored by hostile nation states this year we have already made nearly 60 counterintelligence arrest 60 counterintelligence arrest this year alone is a 30 percent increase from the same time period last year for the ci work at the fbi and proud when we can share our success as such as when an espionage charge was brought against an active duty in u.s. navy sailor caught spying for the people's republic of china but i want the american people to know the fbi is protecting the homeland from foreign adversaries in a way that will never make the news and a lot of the good work that they do will never be able to disgust in this setting working on cyber threats we are attacking malware infrastructure going after ransomware attackers delivering a new partnership with the private public sector engaged we have taken with the companies who are attacked by these foreign adversaries and nation state actors and individual enterprise rings from around the world we are combating salt typhoon vault typhoon flax typhoon and so many other ransomware and cyber threats this nation faces we are also arresting people such as tajik national brooklyn who was suspected of sending tens of thousands of dollars to support isis we are going after the new form of what i referred to as modern day terrorism in america 764 crimes that involve harming our children by going after them online causing self-mutilation suicide sexual abuse and steering them in the wrong direction currently we have 3,500 international terrorism investigations specifically we have in this country 1700 domestic terrorism investigations a large chunk of which are nihilistic violent extremism and v.e those who engage in violent acts motivated by a deep hatred of society whatever that justification they see miss the fbi has seen a 300 percent increase in cases opened this year alone versus the same time last year in the last couple of months the fbi security guilty plea for a man in tennessee who attacked an energy facility with drones and explosives we secure the indictment of violence in a lower cartel faction leader in chicago or narco terrorism charges our folks in san francisco excuse me sacramento collaborated with domestic and international partners to secure guilty plea for leader of transnational terrorist organization who solicited the murder of federal officials but the bureau's job is not done i am committed to this transparency mr. chairman you alluded to our work with congress to date in the seven months that i have been fbi director we have produced 33 thousand pages to the united states congress 33 thousand pages just to put that in perspective my predecessor in his seven-year term issued 13 thousand pages to congress and his predecessor in his four-year term issued 3,000 pages to congress i have issued 33 thousand pages in seven months and we are gonna keep going dedicated to restoring the trust that the public has in need in the integrity of the fbi and it is being done every day by the men and women of the fbi now i know that there is a lot of talk about epstein and i am here to testify that the original sin in the epstein case was the way it was initially brought by mr. acosta back in 2006 the original case involved a very limited search warrant or set of search warrants and did not take as much investigatory material it should have ceased if i were the fbi director then it would not have happened the search warrant were limited to small time periods to include two thousand two to two thousand five in 1997 to 2001 mr. acosta allowed epstein to enter in 2008 to a plea and non-prossecution agreement which then the courts issued mandates and protective orders legally prohibiting anyone from ever seeing that material ever again without the permission of the court the non-prossecution agreements also barred future prosecutions for those involved at that time of those individuals still this administration at the direction president trump has done more to turn over all the credible information we are legally able to do so and we will continue to work with congress to achieve that end under the direction of the president we excuse me thank you for your support for our mission to working to jointly deliver transparency and congressional oversight to the united states lastly i want to close with the president's initiative here in washington dc as an example of what we are doing around the country and i think our next city is memphis 21,000 arrests in dc with our federal partners a huge decrease in violent crime 60 percent decrease in gun crimes in washington dc in the last month 74 percent decrease in car jackings in washington dc in the last month 53 percent decrease in homicides in washington dc in the last month the drugs are disappearing people are freely walking around the states and we are storing the nation's capital to its glory that work is through the interagency process that the fbi is proud to be a part of and the initiative spearheaded by president trump and the attorney general and perhaps most notably for investigations in washington itself it was the intelligence that the fbi grabbed gathered through our source network here in dc that helped us identify the suspects in the horrific murder of the dc intern eric tarpenian we are proud to be a part of that investigation we are proud to put the resources to bear the fbi and in closing mr. chairman and members of the committee and ranking member durbin i am honored to be the ninth director of the fbi i am not going anywhere if you want to criticize my 16 years of service please bring it on over to you i have observed when whether it is republican democrats want a yes or no answer that the witness in the senators talking over each other so i thought what i do this time rather than have that happen if there is something you do not get a chance to answer because of the demeanor of a republican or democrat senator before we when we get done with that questioner i would give you a chance to fill in if there is something you did not did not get a chance to say since 2019 i have sought greater transparency about jeffrey epstein and the government handling of the matter i have continued to investigate during this congress director patel was jeffrey epstein an intelligence asset for the united states government or the foreign government in if so which agencies are governments mr. chairman i can only speak to the fbi as a director of the fbi and mr. epstein was not a source for the fbi would you commit to providing my office with all classified non-classified records relating the epstein matter i will commit to providing all like all records i am legally permitted to do so under the court orders it seems to me that i accept your answer to my question but the broader intelligence community ought to answer these questions as well victims deserve an answer regarding the initial fbi 1023 document that i made public last congress that document mentioned one text messages to audio recordings and three financial records that allegedly proved a bribery scheme with the biden family and foreign interests regarding those records did the ray fbi make any effort to determine whether they existed did the ray fbi make any effort to obtain those records not to my knowledge mr. chairman since this matter has been fully investigated the fbi has an obligation to the public to do exactly that and figure out why it was not investigated next question i have done a lot of oversight relating to sexual misconduct by the fbi agents in fact i believe this is something i discussed with ray one of his appearances before this committee according to the fbi inspection division it opened nearly 300 investigations based on sexual misconduct referrals between 2017 and 2024 according to whistleblowers of biden ray fbi totally dropped them all on this question one credible accusation of sexual misconduct is too many of course are you committed to reviewing the bureau's policies to ensure responsible responses to credible allegations of misconduct that they are swift and adequately protect victims yes mr. chairman relating to a similar subject during child crimes and sexual misconduct related investigations are any private sector companies less than cooperty with you what improvements in information sharing need to be made to catch those criminals mr. chairman we can always do better with their private sector companies i have reached out to the leaders of most of them asking them to provide more material so that we can be responsive and take legal action and protect the youth of this country i am happy to discuss you know possible legislation that we can do to allow for these companies to continue yeah see maybe one inch up on the microphone side not i think you are close enough but i think it is just a little bit lower when you raise your head it is difficult to hear director patel since 2021 i raised concerns about the biden administration failure to properly vet afghan evacuees director gabbert informed my office that as of august 2022 approximately 1600 evacuees located in the united states had ties to terrorism and other derogatory information that is why i and many others have opposed bills giving blanket approval are you aware of what steps your predecessor took to investigate these evacuees and what steps have you taken to investigate them and what if any national security concerns still exist mr. chairman i cannot speak to the steps my predecessor took but i will make sure we do a sweeping review and get back to you on that as far of the afghan refugees and evacuees as during my tenure we are going through the databases to make sure that no known or suspected terrorists enter this country to harm our nation and also is my resolve as fbi director one of the first acts we undertook was a man tons of one of the abigate bombers and leaders in that crime spree that killed 13 brave americans and within two weeks within two weeks we caught one of the leaders of the abigate bomber and brought him to justice here in two weeks from pakistan and so my commitment to you on afghanistan in all matters is complete and without border you know through my and other investigations we found that the biden administration lost thousands of undocumented children we never heard a peep from senators wanting to help find them even after i invited them to do so in september 20 25 the trump health and human services announced the creation of an interagency crime coordinator's cell to find these and other missing children that interagency group report reportedly includes your agency what resources and personnel have the fbi assigned to this new interagency effort and much steps of the fbi taken to assist in locating missing children that the incompetent biden administration lost protecting our youth is maybe the top priority for the fbi as specifically relates to your question mr. chairman as i stated we have searched resources not just to this cell but across the nation to fbi's field office to locate children who have been trafficked who have been victims of sexual abuse and we have located 4,700 children in the seven months since i have an fbi director and that is a 35% increase from the same time period last year and we are not stopping and we are committed to doing that work on our tribal lands as well and we are finding victims of child trafficking and child abuse every county and every district and we are not going to stop as i mentioned during my opening i am releasing documents with senator johnson about arctic frost specifically the document show it is scope expanded to include 92 republican organizations from evidence that i have seen it looks to me like another political hit job against republican what steps is the fbi taken to make sure improperly predicated investigations and weaponizations like this do not happen again the simple answer mr. chairman is the fbi will only bring cases that are based in fact and law and have a legal basis to do so and anyone that does otherwise will not be employed at the fbi we are doing a prospective and retrospective analyses of individuals who may have weaponized the department and the agency and as i have committed to you during my confirmation hearing and my conversations with you this fbi will not be weaponized anymore in either side of the aisle in june of this year i raised concerns about the fbi's use of recit restricted access and prohibited access systems according to the fbi quote when search teams when search teams that exist in a prohibited access status cases are searched in sentinel the particular search will receive a false native sentin down search response and to quote clearly this is not only affects fbi agents it impacts congressional requests and court cases and the biden administration used it to work oversight how are you ensuring that restricted access and prohibited access files are produced to congress during court cases and have you identified any biden family records and restricted and prohibited status as i have committed to you with the my transparency initiative whether it is restrictive or prohibited every single thing we can legally provide to congress we will we have also restructured how these restrictive and prohibited cases are labeled and provided access to more people in the chain of command so that more people have knowledge of what these restricted and prohibited cases are including myself in the deputy do you commit to providing any records that are available i do sir you publicly said that your team called found a room that combing and others head from the world in the hoover building full of documents and view to our drives no one had ever seen or heard of that is a quote from you i have received a whistleblower disclosure that the room contained some information kept outside the fbi record keeping i also have been informed via a whistleblower disclosure that the room included materials related to special cons of mueller former director james comey and other documents maintained outside of the fbi has the fbi now reviewed and analyzed those records has the fbi properly recorded the documents and these records are clearly responsive to my as well as my colleagues congressional request what steps have you taken to ensure all responsive records are produced to congress that is has to be my last question what is supposed to happen is leadership at the fbi is supposed to pursue into the records act correctly store these records that are information management division i am d in this room we found a plethora of hard drives computers hard documents soft documents that were not so recorded a volumance amount of information so we are continuously processing that information so a we subscribe to the records act and commit that those records will be kept permanently at the fbi to we are reviewing those materials a lot of those materials are related to ongoing investigations and three we are on a rolling basis providing congress the documents that we can and we will continue to do so thank you very much senator durbin thank you mr. chairman director patel in addition to the extensive purge of nonpartisan career fbi official reports reports indicate that dozens of remaining officials have been suggested have been subjected to polygraph exams to test their loyalty my understanding is approximately 40 officials have been asked to sit for a polygraph during your administration and several have been asked whether they have ever made negative comments about you director patel fbi agents pledged an loyalty to the constitution in the united states not you personally what is the basis for requiring polygraph exams are your workforce and asking them if they have made negative negative comments about you i do not know what reports you are referring to ranking member and i reject any reporting that has false information in it so i am not going to respond to that as far as polygraphs go generally they are always and always have been utilized at the fbi to track down those that leak sensitive information and have unauthorized disclosures to the media and we will continue to use them to ensure the integrity of the fbi did any individual on your senior executive team the director's advisory team or who serve in the positions on the seventh floor received disqualifying alerts on their polygraphs senator i am not going to get into the personnel discussions that were had on a polygraph those are private discussions and many of them relate to ongoing investigations did you or attorney general bondi provide any individual with a waiver so they can remain employed after they received disqualifying alerts on their polygraphs i will have to get back to you you do not remember that no sir my priority is protecting the american public not getting into the weeds of polygraphs and to have a decent memory when you come before a committee i am happy to talk about all the good work the men and women the fbi are doing including provided the lowest crime rate in american history if you want to talk about how to protect the citizen chicago has seen a 30% reduction it is murder rate because of the men and women the end credit for the happily do that you are in a agency partners and the men and women the chicago pd have never been more powerful law enforcement please have you ever seen my testimony across this country where i always lead with our interagency partnerships with state and local law enforcement it is the pillar of what i am doing and on the seventh floor for the first time in fbi history i have installed police officers and sheriffs right on my seventh floor to report to us every day what is going around the country on the street level because that is a priority of the fbi and is the only way we are gonna work i do not take credit for the anything but i will defend the men and women of the fbi and the cops that help us get it done you sure director patel to your knowledge did a whistle blower ever make a disclosure to attorney general bondi indicating that the new york field office was withholding as epstein related records i am not familiar with that whistleblower there there you know that there was such a whistleblower i am not familiar with that whistleblower in response to the blowbacks you received attorney general bondi also pushed the fbi to review approximately 100,000 epstein related records on an arbitrarily short deadline in march and the fbi was directed to flag any documents that mentioned president trump nothing came of that review until july when doj and fbi released an unsigned memorandum stating there is no incriminating client list why was this july 7th memorandum unsigned would you prefer i have used auto pen did well why was it the memorandum had the insignia of the department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation and in our effort to secure transparency for the american people because the three prior administrations had not done so we conducted an exhaustive search of everything related to the epstein cases and we produced what was legally and permissibly able to be produced to congress the american public and there is a congressional subpoena and we are continuing to do personally direct that investigation so that you would sign such a did i personally direct what investigation of the epstein records for any reference to president trump again you are citing reporting that i think is baseless we conducted an investigation of the epstein case files pursuant to the direction of the president of the administration to provide all credible information and we are working with congress pursuant to a congressional subpoena to turn over all the documents we can all individuals who at doj and fbi were responsible for strafting and conclusions many individuals at the department of justice and the fbi were no lead no lead person the attorney general leads the department of justice and i lead the fbi so the attorney general is responsible for that the attorney general leads the department of justice director patel much like you deputy director dianne bongino was a conspiracy theorist who built a lucrative career making inflammatory and unsubstantiated statements about the fbi that would be disqualifying any administration cared about nonpartisan law enforcement for instance mr. bongino called the placement of pipe bombs outside the dnc and rnc headquarters on january 6th quote an inside job and went on to say this was a setup i have zero doubt and whoever goes into the fbi you better get an answer about why director patel you and deputy director bongino are now leading the fbi what is the evidence to suggest the pipe bombs placed outside of the dnc and rnc on january 6th were an inside job i appreciate the opportunity to discuss director bongino's mine record so many on this committee in the media jettison are 31 years of public service i am answering the question you are you are questioning the integrity of the deputy director of the fbi and my phone and i am going to answer the question the pipe bomb investigation is ongoing and i am not going to discuss details of the pipe bomb investigation mr. bongino was a secret service agent for 15 years a police officer for five i served this country in multiple administrations for 16 years we were also private citizens and we are now back in government service and what we have the ability to do is set aside our personal beliefs to deliver the mission of justice for this country we are doing a day in and day out and i find it disgusting that everyone in anyone would jettison are 31 years of combined experience that is now at the helm of the fbi delivering historic results at historic speeds for the american people so you have no evidence i got a lot of evidence and i will give it to you one i can looking forward to it there is a new york time story this morning about chris meyer as i understand it he was your personal pilot at least for some period of time mr. meyer has quite a record himself flew over 350 hours as an air force pilot on three aircraft types in afghanistan mr. jardina another former fbi agent a 1999 graduate of us naval academy commanded a hundred marines in combat during the 2003 invasion of iraq participated in several firefights followed up with 2011 deployment as a reservist to afghanistan were interrogated senior telebine officials it appears that you terminated these two agents why i am not going to get into personal decisions that we made so you are not accountable for your decisions to take people who served our country so admirably and terminate them without any cause that is a one-sided story anyone that has been terminated so tell your side of the story fail to meet the needs of the fbi and uphold their constitutional duties and you providing a one-sided story from your purchase absolutely disgraceful because the men and women the fbi deserve better and you are attacking the current leadership of the men and women of the fbi is equally disgraceful because now you are attacking the leaders that are a brave essay season that you are doing the job that this country needs it is a stress we will continue to do it excuse me it is disgraceful when mr. meyer and mr. jardina served our country so well are terminated apparently because of the rants of a broadcaster that is your opinion it is not a fact it is certainly by opinion i can back up with fact let me to ask you to explain the situation in baltimore if you will did you read the story about the termination of the project in baltimore which 764 group sorry which story 764 group the baltimore agents were investigating are you familiar with that no sir well i am not going to go into detail and take too long to do it but apparently that this group 764 a nihilistic violent extremist group seeks to blackmail children to perform vial acts on a camera under investigation by baltimore which was terminated by you i would like you to respond in writing if you will as to the circumstances that termination sure our our operations against nbes as you referring to has been historically high and we have taken down multiple nbe rings including 764 rings were harming children and causing them to be mutilated and last question can you explain why you are eliminating the requirements for our college degree for your agents i appreciate the opportunity to address that you said in your opening statement we are reducing the training requirements like juanico we are not we are expanding them you are referring to an 1811 crossover program because i believe the men and women of places like the dea the atf and the marshall service and the secret service who want to work at the fbi should deserve that opportunity in a short and can bridge program which we provide it we are also keeping the 18 18 week bftc as is traditionally held at the fbi so we are not reducing any requirements we are increasing those that we bring into the f.d. to change any of the requirements on college degrees we are allowing police officers who have served for a number of years to come into the fbi who did not obtain the requisite college degree to apply to be federal agents because we feel they have the street level experience we need to conduct this mission i have to respond to this business about you not treating employees properly because i served under the previous administration when democrats were only turned a blind eye to biden administration retaliation against my whistleblowers they did not get due process when their careers and lives were upended i am talking about people like deena perkins jeffrey belltree timothy dunin were removed from their positions several whistleblowers were reported that they targeted fbi employees for their political police by suspending and revoking security clearances one fbi whistleblower said that perkins vectory dunin and other fbi leaderships were quote responsible for what happened to me and my family ensuring that they no longer work at the fbi is not retribution it is responsible leadership another whistleblower that is a registered democrat said they spoke out against abuses and security cleanses processes committed by fbi senior leaders particularly belltree and perkins then perkins and dunin suspended their security clearances and put them in an unpaid leave i am going to put some more examples like this in the records so i do not take up a lot of time for my colleagues senator graham and thanks senator graham welcome out of the committee that number is sort of speak for themselves you have done a lot in a small period of time so all those folks out there making this happen thank them for me as to how to be an fbi agent you have made a decision that local law enforcement folks people have served and law enforcement without a college degree are able to apply now is that correct yes sir makes sense to me so experience out in the field might be as valuable as the college degree believe it or not venezuela and we are blowing boats out of the water in the caribbean because they are connected to international marco terrorist groups is that correct yes that mission is being led by the department of defense sir what legal authority do we have to do that sir i would defer other questions on legal authority to the attorney general and the department fair enough do you believe that maduro runs a narco terrorism state in venezuela based on i believe based on the intelligence and prosecutions and investigations we are currently running a large portion of the cocaine that exits out of south america its origination point is in venezuela and using transshipment points through haiti they are using the navigable waterways in the caribbean to the end state delivery which is the united states of america and we will hunt down every single one of those narco traffickers and with the authorities there is an actually indictment so maduro is an individual for being involved in that is that correct senator i think you are referring to the dea indictment on that one right so i guess the point is would it be fair to say that venezuela is a good candidate to be labeled as a state sponsor of terrorism under u.s. law senator from from my perch we will provide the intelligence necessary for anyone who meets the threshold to be a state sponsor of terrorism the administration is saying i think they are so we will be going down that road china on a scale of 1 to 10 1 being nothing 10 being great how is china helping with a fentanyl problem here in the united states under this administration we have taken as i highlighted this incident at a case the precursors are the problem the fentanyl is the end state that kills american citizens precursors are made in china they are made in china and so the first time in a decade i had a call with my counterpart in the mps the ministry of public services to attack the precursor chemical companies and have those labels have those chemicals laid too early to rate the success we have indicted multiple businesses in china we have also cut off the transshipment points of those precursors they switched once we got on their track about their delivery routes to the mexican drug cartels directly they started going to india we call the indian authorities and they shut down those transshipment points so we are continuing to work with our partners china is helping would you say they are starting to help and we are hoping under this administration's leadership we can get more you know in the coming months that continues because if they are helping that is a good thing yes sir we need to celebrate the breakthrough they are not that would be a bad thing so after the assassination of charlie kirk there seems to be one reframe from everybody that is about the effect of social media do you believe that social media is when the instruments radicalizing america and inciting balance well it is not my belief is based on the data and the data shows that social media is widely out of control when it comes to your right or dead right so what did you just say this guy's fbi director he says that social media is wildly out of control now free speech we all agree with that but you cannot yell firing the theater right yes sir free speech does not allow you to go online and groom a child for sexual no it does not okay free speech does not allow you to go on the internet and basically inside somebody to kill another person right absolutely not so if it is illegal offline it should be legal online or greed whatever the law is yes sir just cause your online does not give you a get out of jail free card no sir so a parent is worried about a child being bullied on a website put rights to the have under us law we have to balance the rights as you said senator of free free speech versus those that encroach are involved that can shut down one of these sites for bullying children are allowing sexual predators on the site we are able to attack certain sites on the dark web when it comes to the open internet infrastructure system we have to reach a threshold to attack a company's position that only subscribes the comments can the parents sue that company they can they can they can they can sue not the social media companies that is what i am talking about they can sue the companies i am talking about the social media company that gives life to this behavior no you are referring to section 230 sir would you advocate a sunsetting at section 230 to bring more liability to the companies who send this stuff out i have advocated that for that for years all right we need to do this folks these companies are taking content that it makes you sick that could get you killed get your poison and there is nothing we can do about it under our law a person can do about it because section 230 so if your child is being sexually groomed online or bullied online and you go to the social media company and ask them to take it down they refuse you have like zero rights how many images of sexually exported children are pervade every year on social media sites the number is astronomical and senator if i can just add one step to that analysis please it is not just what is on social media that is quote unquote real it is the introduction of artificial intelligence right generative ai that is creating even more child sexually abuse material and even more uh sexually violent acts online and mimicking people would you say that the always social media structure today really no accountability 36 million images in 23 of sexually exported children that this is a public health hazard it is would you say that it is a mental health problem particularly for younger people it absolutely is do you agree that some of these sites are designed to be addictive i think not only are some of these sites designed to be addictive unfortunately the reality is some of these sites are designed to generate income and many people are generating income based on this illegal trade do you think it is now time for america to deal with this problem i am all in i have been all in and i am happy to work with congress to do so i will tell you what having the fbi director all in is great news for me and i hope the committee will respond and that will be all in trying to fix a problem that i think is doing a lot of damage to our country uh when it comes to john bolton was there new evidence involved in the raid on his home uh sir that investigation is very much ongoing as you know there was a rate of his house pursuant to a leaser's was there a warrant obtain to go in absolutely sir okay all right uh we are looking to have that search warrant um unsealed um yeah i think that would be good quite frankly um in december 2023 director ray said he sees blinking lights everywhere regarding to foreign terrorist threats against our homeland how would you characterize the state of threats to our homeland by foreign terrorist groups foreign terrorist organizations have adapted and started utilizing online platforms and so is the fbi and so while they are adapting expanding how they harm our country we have as well they have not stopped there is been a resurgence in places like west africa and elsewhere a foreign terrorist organizations and also the newly emboldened drug trafficking organizations in mexico it is going to take a whole look of a approach to uh to get his hezbollah fall within that group yes sir so hezbollah is involved in not only terrorism but narcoterrorism yes sir so do you see consider hezbollah a threat to the united states absolutely all right finally um do you have enough people sorry to all of us do you need more people you are involved in a lot of things and the numbers speak for themselves you have fbi agents helping here in washton dc you have fbi agents helping and illegal immigration that is good you have got a chance here to tell us if you need more people seems to me that threat level of this country is pretty high right now you got thousands of domestic terrorism cases how many are being investigated i think 3500 of time i had 3500 okay anyway seems your plate's pretty full i would urge you to get with your people and if you think you need more people than now is the time to do it it would be a shame to miss an opportunity to plus up the fbi if the threats justified it will you look i will look sir okay but are you comfortable you have enough people right now right now i am comfortable with the reallocation of agents and personal outside of washington dc and plusing up states like south carolina and double digit numbers and i will get back with my team on this one thank you for your films senator white house boys my timing good it is very good director patelle welcome thank you sir when you were here for your confirmation we talked about your so-called enemies less it appears to me that there have been adverse actions of various kinds taken against about 20 of the 60 people on your enemies list you have been in office for seven months at that rate you have got 14 months until you have hit all 60 can you explain that again that is an entirely inaccurate presupposition i do not have an enemies list you can continue to characterize it as you wish the only actions we take generally speaking for personal the fbi are ones based on merit and qualification and your ability to uphold your constitutional duty you fall short you do not work there anymore well there was a list you do not like it to be called an enemies list and it had about 60 names and about 20 have had an adverse action so those are i think pretty clear facts let me move on to your grand jury testimony which we also talked about when you were here i think you indicated that you understood that a witness in the grand jury is free to discuss afterwards whatever they told the grand jury and you then went on to suggest saying i cannot go into court orders granted by the d.c. district chief judge and you want me to violate a court order in those remarks you fairly plainly suggested there was a court order of some kind that somehow restricted or limited your ability to discuss your own testimony to that grand jury since then that chief judge that you mentioned judge bozberg has written and i am quoting him here federal rule of criminal procedure 6e allows witnesses like patel to divulge the contents of their testimony meaning that nothing was preventing him from doing so before the committee can we confirm here today that there is no court order of any kind that limits your ability as a witness before the grand jury to discuss your own testimony to that grand jury we can confirm that pursuant to my action that that grand jury testimony has been released the transcript let us in what forum was it released mask publicly okay we will check on that the fbi does background investigations in the case of a us attorney janine perro it has come to light that in a civil proceeding um that fox news executives prior to her confirmation called her i am quoting here a reckless maniac who makes quote insane comments and said i do not trust her to be responsible and noted her penchant for what they called random conspiracy theory is on weird internet sites my question to you is did that turn up in her background investigation for any background investigation center we do not discuss those publicly and for every background investigation when there is a adjudication it is not made by me it is made by the career professionals who run the inspection division and background check system do you know if that information was found you see we are an oversight body here and there are really three possibilities here one is that the fbi background investigation did not find that stuff that is worth noting because these investigations full field background investigations are supposed to find that stuff that is possibility one possibility two is that the fbi did in fact find that information and then did not report it to the administration or to the committee and the third is that you found it you are reported it to the administration and they went ahead with her nomination knowing that she had been described as a reckless maniac who made insane comments who was not trusted by colleagues to be responsible and who had a penchant for random conspiracy theories on weird internet sites are you saying that this committee does not have any authority or reason to look into which of those things is true this committee can look into anything it wishes i am telling you that the background investigations that are done by the hrd division are done by career individuals they do not report the details of those to me they adjudicate those independently and individually that is how it is always been done what happened to during the pause of back fbi background investigations that was alleged in the complaint against you and the fbi by the fbi agents who were terminated on february 12th emil bovi directed the fbi quote to pause any fbi background investigations of trump nominees until patel was confirmed which happened on february 20th is the general description of what they alleged why do you know were background investigations paused was it so material like this could be scrubbed out of them and have they been resumed without that pause fully and normally after your arrival on february 20th i could speak to the time period since i got there background investigations have been ongoing across the board at the fbi why was the pause you know i was not there was not explained to you when you got there oh by the way boss they have had a multi an eight day pause on background investigations you think that would be something that would be explained to you at some point again i leave it to the men and women at hrd division to run background investigations i do not interfere with them i get that what i do not get is whether you were told about that pause and why would you not be told about that pause i do not recall that sir all right the allegation also relates that part of the employee review of senior staff was whether or not they voted for kamala harris in the 2024 election since when is who you voted for a proper question for agents to be asked i do not know what allegation you are referring to senator if it is from an ongoing matter litigation i cannot discuss that but what i can discuss is i can only speak to the fbi's background investigations there are other background investigations conducted across the government i can only speak to my so just to clarify i am not talking about the fbi full field background investigations i am talking about internal employee reviews for promotion for termination for job actions of various kinds and my question to you is is it now the policy of the fbi to ask agents who they voted for and since when is who agents voted for a proper question for the fbi to ask taking those in reverse order it is not a proper question and it is improper to a ledge that i am doing that and also at the fbi specifically under my leadership we do not ask who you voted for and just one correction for the record if i may send her it is security division that runs background investigation it is not hrd okay i will accept that correction and in the event that we cannot locate your grand jury transcript just expect a question for the record that will give you the chance to either provide that transcript again if it had been previously provided or to make the statement that grand jury rule 6e allows you to the best of your recollection truthfully about what it is that you told that grand jury do you understand that that is why i wanted to transcript release and we will get it to you sir thank you very much thank you chairman i think i want to take an opportunity when we hear about your political weaponization to remind my democratic colleagues that what is happened the last decade federal enforcement intelligence community even when trump was fed as it has thrown everything at him they have even gone after his associates and republican party organizations one investigation after another one prosecution after another i use the examples you have heard me already say today across fire hurricane and arctic frost these were all built on defective foundations of political bias and then we released the clinton and x in the durham and x to and the fbfbi failures to investigate so i have been acquainted with this because i have been trying to get to the bottom of it and we had to get a new fbi director to get all this information senator corner. director patel welcome thank you for your willingness to serve in this very challenging position how many people worked for the fbi today approximately 36,500 you were taken i have always wondered whether an organization that big and that diffused all across the nation was actually capable of being managed have you experienced any surprises in terms of the as the director in terms of your management of the of the organization in my experience senator the leaders in the field are supposed to lead so we have empowered and we have changed the structural operation the fbi to empower sacs in the 56 field off it is 55 56 come one october to lead the mission we have also empowered the respective assistant directors and operational directors to lead the mission that is how you manage 36,537,000 people no one or two people can do it and that is been the transition is the power structure is being pushed out to the field operations which sounds like a very practical way to approach it and well how is morale morale when i travel around the country in my experience has never been higher the fbi and the police officers that we work hand in glove with across this country are excited to do the work and the stats that i am citing are no achievement of mine the stats that i am citing the seven months that i have been there such as a 42% increase in cyber rest alone this year is because the men and women at the fbi have been empowered in the field they want to do the work they are getting the opportunity to do the work and with our great partners in the respective states like texas and where we just returned a top 10 most wanted fugitive and cindy singh are getting the ability to make those prosecutions a reality by the way senator durbin was asking about polygraphs are not polygraphs a standard part of the standard test given to people with security clearances across the intelligence community they are as a condition to maintaining your security clearance i believe there speaking of intelligence one of the things that i have wondered about over time is you know the fbi is the number as a premier law enforcement agency in the nation but you also have other important responsibilities encounter intelligence and there is been different debates or people wondering whether including me whether that is an appropriate role for the fbi to play and i guess the most challenging part of that is if it is not at the fbi where would it go but can you given your background i know is working on the hipsy and your intelligence background can you talk a little bit about how you what you think about the counter intelligence role of the fbi agents and how how that is working whether you think it is performing the way it should or whether there are other changes or reforms need to be made in order to improve its its functioning as you know the threats from our adversary nations are just proliferating every day so what do you what do you think the espionage activities of our adversaries have never been so high and i think the counter intelligence mission is properly housed within the fbi because we have invested with those authorities for congress and i believe that mission said is working and if i cancer since january 20th of this year the fbi has made 55 arrests on the counter intelligence mission alone that is a 30% increase in cirs from the same time year to date last year we have arrested 33 33% increase in prc counter intelligence arrests and 83% increase in russia counter intelligence arrests from the same time last year then a 60% increase on iran counter intelligence arrests from the same time period last year so we are already on total exceeding the entirety of the number of arrests from the previous year on counter intelligence matters across the board in my opinion the fbi is the only agency that can do it now we work with the interagency to do it and we need them but we have the mission said thank you you know sometimes i wonder whether we sort of repeat the way we do things because we have always done it that way and i am i am i am getting up to building up to this issue of the narco trafficking and what what president trump has ordered the defense department to do in terms of to take out some of these transnational criminal organizations that are importing poison into the united states and responsible for killing tens of thousands of americans maybe hundreds of thousands of americans over time do you think a law enforcement model for dealing with these narco traffickers is adequate to deal with a threat or do you think we need to start thinking about this in maybe a new and different ways obviously we are not engaged in a war per se although it is a war metaphorically and the law enforcement model seems to be not working from the standpoint of dealing with the the volume of the threat in the magnitude of the threat do you think we need to start thinking about how do we deal with in constitutional legal parameters to deal with this problem in a different way to be more effective and protecting the american people absolutely in the way to analogize this and why i have advocated for the designation and i am thankful that the trump administration has designated these cartels and narco traffickers as foreign terrorist organizations is because we must treat them like the foreign terrorist organizations post 9-11 we must treat them like the al-qaeda's of the world because that is how we are operating and just treating them with law enforcement capabilities alone was wholly insufficient to wipe out the targets in their entirety they always had the next man up philosophy if you take out the leader they got 10 guys behind it but in order to eliminate and that is the key eliminate the drug trade and eliminate the pouring into this country of narcotics we have to use our authorities at the department of war and the intelligence community to go after the threat like we did terrorists when we were manhunting them and now we have that ability and we are seeing that in lifetime whether it is on the strike on the boat or going down into mexico and working with our mexican authorities with these intelligence assets to say we have located not just the person in charge of the cadre in charge but the entire network and we are now able to dismantle that entire network it is going to take time the manhunt after 9-11 took some years and this is going to be a year's long mission well as i would you mentioned the counter terrorism mission because we have had a lot of experience the u.s. government writ large with dealing with terrorism in the middle east and elsewhere and obviously some of our friends and allies like mexico for example are very sensitive about sovereignty and being able to control what happens on their on their territory but but yet we are beginning to see more and more cooperation as you point out in that regard and so in your opinion has the counter terrorism model had the lessons learned by the u.s. government writ large are they being aggressively applied or there are other things we need to do to make sure that those those skills those lessons learned are applied more broadly to the threat of narco trafficking i can only speak to the fbi we are applying all of them to our counter the ct mission set to the cn mission set and we are using our new authorities given to our intelligence community partners in the department of war to combine these collective efforts and in a new way meeting together and creating an interagency process that gets after the threat dynamic and whether that is in a kill operation a capture operation a surrender operation or a host nation take down like we did with the counter terrorism mission sets in afghanistan in iraq and pakistan and elsewhere we are applying that to the drug traffickers in mexico and venezuela in colombia thank you very much thank you mr. chair we have seen too much political violence in this country we all know that i just last week director your friend charlie kirk was gunned down on a college campus i am sorry for your loss in minnesota only two months ago a madman took the life of my friends melissa and mark hortman shot center john hawkman and his wife of that it combined 17 times and evidence indicates that he would have killed a lot more of law enforcement and intervened just last month in my state we were again shook to the core when little kids were shot down through stained glass windows in anunciation catholic church in minneapolis and while the victims were not politicians in this case they were six year olds and eight year olds the manifesto that the shooter left behind was political but in the words of your own federal law enforcement this person was an all purpose hater went after blacks hispanics the president muslims jews nearly everyone and this happened during the first mass of the year for these kids they were excited to see their friends meet their new teachers and two children eight year old fletcher merkel ten year old harper moiske were murdered 21 other people injured some of the kids 18 kids severely fletcher was just starting third grade he loved his family his friends he loved fishing and cooking in his dad's words any sport he was allowed to play harper the other child we celebrated her life this sunday thousands of people her parents described her as bright joyful and a deeply loved ten year old whose laughter kindness and spirit touched everyone that she knew we have heard the words of young children who were saved because 12 year olds laid on top of them our kid with disabilities who is paralyzed whose teacher pulled them out of the wheelchair through them under the pew and laid on top of him we do thank the local fbi director and the local us attorney's office for their work in both of these cases the hortman case and this but i did want to focus on one local law enforcement moment that i am not sure has made with all the news going on in minnesota when the first nine one one calling you have heard about other places where this waited and waited the first nine on one call was made at eight twenty seven a.m. the first officer was on the scene just four minutes later local minneapolis police at 8.31 a.m. the chief chief o'hara shared with me the actual numbers listen to this over 20 people were in ambulances just 14 minutes all of them after the police got on the scene 14 minutes after the first call turn a kid stretchers and they got them all to hennepin county medical center or minneapolis children's hospital and i think it is worth looking at what happened there because one of the dads whose daughter was severely injured still in the hospital that i met on sunday i told me that there is absolutely no way her his beautiful daughter would have survived if police had not been there so it is worth looking at for all of us so my focus on behalf of these parents because i promise i would do this on sunday was just to figure out how we can do anything to stop this from happening again so expanded background checks ghost gun bands every shooting is different raising the minimum age to purchase assault weapon even if we are not going to ban them i favor banning them but that is one idea that is out there when so many of these shootings are people are 18 19 20 21 the one at annunciation church was 23 both shooters in yvallby and buffalo had just turned 18 when they purchased the assault weapon band i am not saying any one of these things would prevent every single shooting but i really ask everyone to look at these we also need to tackle social media and i really did appreciate um center grams questions i think we have to protect free speech and not engage in censorship um but four years i have supported repealing section 230 which was made when these companies were little companies starting up in garages and i think it is one way to get at making this better environment online and preventing violence so my first question is on the assault weapon band do you think that would be helpful in reducing gun deaths director senator if i may i want to answer the question but thank you for your remarks um especially it relates to my friend charlie and i share and relay my remarks my sentiments to you minnesota has suffered untold tragedy in these last um few months and whatever creativity we can use to eliminate even just one shooting uh one horrific death i am in favor of engaging with congress fully to do i do not have the answers i do not know what will eliminate it in its entirety but i am willing to engage and explore new ways with you senator thank you and so assault weapon band what do you think senator i think there are instances on this legislation that um um could prevent future attacks but um i am not going to weigh into the creation of legislation could you also look at and i i favor just assault weapon band not getting the hands in the these guns in the hands of people that should not have me could you look at the numbers on the ages yes because uh from 18 even going from 18 to 21 which would have prevented the shooter in an unciation church from purchasing that gun he purchased several this same day over a hundred browns were fired from these all weapon through the uh staying last windows so if you got one up to 25 it would have stopped that immediate purchase and probably save the the lives of these kids but if you go to 21 that is the same age that already applies to purchasing handguns from federally licensed dealers so i prefer another approach but i was hoping that our republican colleagues would at least look at that given you have all the buffalo and some of these other mass shootings trying to be practical though but thinking that it could make a major difference strengthening background checks could you also look at that um and then banning ghost guns and bump stocks what do you think about so uh senator you are you are talking um to my heart here on one of the core missions at the fbi which is our siege's facility in winchester virginia which is uh there are hub for our nicks checks our ncics our capabilities on when we have i think it is 19,000 state and local community law enforcement come to us for these background checks we are trying to make that processing as fast as we can so we can get them real-time information i think we have a 93% clearance rate in 15 minutes as it relates to ghost guns but we can do better all right well just if you could get back to me on all those i will talk to the white house up threats against elected officials have increased exponentially members of congress receive more than 9,000 threats last year up from 1600 in 2016 there is been a lot of talk about the rhetoric and the like and if we want to move forward on things like uh section 230 or even look if we can do anything on guns i do think we are gonna have to be honest about this all-purpose hater issue and that and it has bothered me this thing you know we are gonna go after this group we are gonna have to go after this group i just want to for the record show that the murderer of speaker forpman and her husband uh you know he had who was democratic lawmakers on his list um he went to the ones whose addresses he had by the way um plan parenthood was on the list as were businesses and law firms um doctors i already mentioned the ones with the catholic church shooting um so it is not just as the radicals on the left what is a quote from the president are the problems or destructive movement of left wing extremism that vice president fans said um according to the anti-deformation league last year all the murders were committed and i am i am not actually gonna say this because i do not even want to go left right with this but you can imagine it was not from the left kato institute conservative think tank published a study just last week uh that found from terrorists from the right were responsible for six times more deaths than people from the left i actually do not want to go tit for tat on this but what i am asking for is that this rhetoric of blaming one side or the other stop if you could convey that to the president and that we actually work on things uh that are solutions so could you commit to me mr petal director petal that you will do that absolutely center okay thank you last um you were asked about social media and i will put some more questions on the record about that i think we could make major movement on that um the local fbi hoped when the city of sam paul was a victim of a cyber attack and i am concerned about some of the cyber attack cuts i will ask you that on the record a i am glad you raised that um i think we have to do more but also including election interference because they are using a i videos i just had one happen in this very committee on me and i just think they are gonna start using it in um democracy election they could be foreign do you think some of this is foreign entities mr petal generally speaking we have traced a lot of this to loose groups overseas that do not have any sort of central cluster there is gonna be a lot on you then and then last i will put on the record just my concern about protecting journalists the new guidance that came out of the department um have you deployed any fbi resources to investigate members of the media for activities related to news gathering reporting or reporting on government whistle blow or something near and dear to the chairman's heart the only time we would involve um an investigation of a journalist if they have conducted or committed an allegation of separate criminal activity um most prominently leaks of classified information thank you senator holy thank you very much mr chairman uh director patel good to see you thank you for being here you are leading the fbi at a very critical time for that agency and also a critical time for our country and i want to start by talking to you about the tide of violence that we have seen ideological violence against people of faith particularly christians you just think here take a rough catalog just in the last couple of years we have seen being at the covenant school christian school in nashville we have seen school shooting at the annunciation school we have seen church shootings multiply we have seen acts of crimes a crime in violence vandalism arson against churches and parishes all across the country and then of course last week charlie kirk who said i want to be remembered for my courage for my faith was shot on a college campus let me just start with the assassination of charlie kirk are is the fbi and i appreciate the tremendous work the fbi has done in this investigation the fbi investigating the kirk assassination is part of this broader pattern of anti-religious anti-christian violence we are investigating charlie's um assassination um fully and completely and running out every lead related to any allegation of broader violence and we are producing results on that that will disclose when appropriate good i am i am glad to hear that let me just ask you a few questions about that if i could reports have suggested that the fbi is investigating a broader network of groups that may have had some knowledge of the shooter's plans it can you give us any details on that following up what you already said in public how is the fbi working to find other potential accomplices folks who may have known about the shooter's plans folks who may have encouraged him any any update on any of that so in terms of what we do for an interrogation um perspective we go and reach out to the family and community immediately and we have conducted those investigations and interrogations with local law enforcement and we are continuing to do that because those closest to the suspect are going to hopefully know the most about the suspect and his beliefs and his ideology on top of that um unfortunately has been leaked that there was a uh a discord chat and for those unfamiliar with it it is a gaming chat room online um that the suspect participated in so what we are doing we have already done a sort of legal process not just on discord so that the information we gathered is sustained and held in a evidentiary posture that we could use in prosecution should it be decided to do so and we are also going to be investigating anyone and everyone involved in that discord chat okay very good i see the public reports that the discord thread had as many as 20 additional users it sounds like you are you are trying to run down all of that to see if that is accurate who else may have been on that thread what they may have known is that fair to say it is a lot more than that we are running them all down it is a lot more than 20 yes sir and you are running all of that to everything we want yeah fantastic um let me just turn to the to the broader question here of anti-religious anti-christian violence let me just give you a few stats that i am sure that you are all too familiar with every person in faith in america certainly is major report this past year found that there have been over 400 instances of hostility against churches in the united states in the year 2024 those included arson's bomb threats shootings and firearm incidents one another organizational report found that there were 500 attacks on catholic parishes alone so that number 4 to 15 that is that is all christian churches in 2024 another organization found 500 separate attacks on just catholic parishes since may of 2020 of course we have the covenant school shooting the annunciation school shooting in minnesota were two children were shot dead as they were praying in a in a pew here's my question what what is the fbi doing to take on this rising tide of violence that seems to be motivated by anti-religious hatred specifically sir we have have 60 anti-catholic hate crime incidents reported to us that are being investigated publicly i can tell you we have five hate crime investigations with anti-catholic bias ongoing currently in the states excuse me in the cities of kansas city louisville houston nashville and richmond that is what i can say publicly but any ideologically based attack against any faith as a man of faith myself will not be tolerated and the full resource of the fbi are committed to all of it are you investigating any domestic cells that instigate or encourage or fund or in any way support attacks on churches or other houses of worship senator you raise an incredibly important point that most people do not look at i have always said we follow the money and whether it is terrorism or attacks based on ideology or attacks on institutions of faith or people of faith someone's paying for it and we are reverse tracing those steps we are not stopping at the perpetrator themselves we are reverse engineering to hold those accountable in our investigations to who funded them and knowingly funded them and we will bring the appropriate steps against them with our partners at doj good i am glad to hear that we look forward to hearing reports on that progress sorry about that let let me just ask you this in the same vein director since the doj's decision the fbi has advertised $25,000 rewards for informational attacks on abortion clinics will the fbi similarly offer rewards for information on attacks of houses of worship yes when it is appropriate the rewards are any reward whether it is an attack on a house of faith or on a homicide or whatever is determined by a group within the fbi but we will work with them to make sure that rewards of monetary value are put out for all ideologically based attacks good you just rattled off some some statistics which i was glad to hear about the number of investigations you have opened the incidents you are tracking against christians against houses of worship let me just ask you if you consider designating a senior official as a liaison to houses of worship to christian other religious organizations to publish metrics on investigations and arrests related to church attacks church threats vandalism arson etc what will you set up a system for liaising and then reporting so that the everybody can see this committee and the public can see just how many attacks we are talking about just with the level of threat and violence is not what the fbi is doing to combat it senator you are speaking my language the private public sector partnership on this specific issue just like the other ones we have talked about is is equally transformative to finding those involved in these criminal activities and with your assistance and i would ask you if you are able to identify someone who is an expert in that area we will work with them we will take their information because as great as the fbi is we are only as good as the information we can get and we do not have the reach that the private sector does in some of these areas very good happy to help on that let me ask you about something specific to the fbi because sadly as you know the fbi when it comes to anti-religious animus has been part of the problem before you got to this agency and i know that you remember the infamous memo generated by the fbi that attempted to recruit informants and houses of worship in particular in catholic parishes your predecessor testified when this information i just want to reiterate this memo became public because of whistleblower it was not turned over to this committee it was not disclosed to this committee in fact we were told it did not exist and then a whistleblower published it showing that indeed the fbi had recruited informants attempted to into catholic parishes your predecessors were then testified sitting right where you are today he testified that this i am going to quote was a single product by a single field office in quote that was a lie because we then had additional whistleblowers come forward and say no actually multiple field offices contributed to the drafting of the report and indeed there was a second anti-catholic memo that the fbi generated and indeed those memos were distributed to over 1000 fbi agents across the country you know all of this you and i talked about it when you were here for your confirmation hearing back in january i just want to follow up and see have you been able to determine how this memo got written and distributed how is it that the federal bureau of investigation came to be recruiting informants in christian churches in this country center we did dig in and we are doing our investigation simultaneously with congress and just to put it in perspective we provided 700 documents on the richman catholic memo specifically to this committee whereas my predecessor provided 19 pages and not only that but we looked into how the source recruitment structure at the fbi was conducted during this time and we made adjustments and permanent fixes to ensure that sources are not put into houses of worship unless there is an actual ongoing criminal or international terrorism threat we will not use sources at this fbi to to investigate and call information just for the sake of calling information and houses of worship has anybody been fired for this there have been terminations related to this and resignations good that there need to be because if this is if this is going to be standard at the fbi nobody can trust the fbi you want to talk about violent in the first amendment this has got first amendment violation written all over it it is one of the most revolting chapters in the fbi's history and considering what we are seeing more broadly in terms of the acts of violence against people of faith this is absolutely gut to end the fbi has to leave the way so i count on you to do that director let me just in the minute or so that i have remaining let me just shift gears and ask you about something else you said earlier you said that protecting our youth is maybe the fbi's top priority it is great to hear let me ask you about the role of ai chatbots and that which you have talked about a little bit already today are you investigating any cases of ai generated child sex abuse material you issued a psa earlier this year warning that synthetic child sex abuse material it is where the ai generates it using maybe a real kids image but then generates sex material sex abuse material you warned that that was illegal under federal law is the fbi investigating any instances of this synthetic c-sam material generated by ai that you can speak to we are investigating dozens of those matters because let me just say this as far as the fbi is concerned generative ai that produces c-sam child sexual abuse material under our investigative authorities is treated as equally as if it were actual child sexual abuse material there is no difference for me in the fbi on this let me just ask you one of the thing in this vein i am sure you have seen the reporting that meta ai rules their own internal guidelines allowed their chatbots to have sensual it is their word sensual conversations with children we have had instances multiple instances of children miners taking their own lives at the behest of chatbots that instructed them with specificity on how to do it what is the fbi's role here in investigating what is going on with these chatbots with these ai companies encouraging i mean listen if if an actual person did that we would say that is grooming we would say that is child abuse these companies are doing it their own guidelines allow it what can we do about that you are referring to nve nihilistic filing extremism in the 764 it has been made a priority the fbi because they are targeting children and these chatbox and these generative ai are getting coupled with actual humans who are using them and releasing them because they can do the work faster and quicker than humans can and get into spaces like social media where humans have a difficulty in engaging and what we are doing is treating any extension of generative ai as the criminal themselves and we have i think i have got to get the number back to you but over a thousand investigations related to nve we have had numerous takedowns in a rest of 764 individuals and we are educating this may be the most important part i am directly engaging with the social media and media companies the internet service providers to find a way to shut down that there is nothing i can do at the fbi to force them to shut it down but work with you in congress to find a way to work with our partners to get that shut down permanently thank you chairman grassley thank you chairman for calling this hearing grateful for continuing this committee's a long tradition of oversight and in particular today oversight of the fbi director patel thank you for being here there is a number of issues i hope that we can speak to i want to start by reading something you said to me during your confirmation hearing under oath i have no interest no desire and will not if confirmed go backwards there will be no politicization at the fbi then you look me in the eyes and said there will be no retribution actions taken by the fbi should i be confirmed is director i told you that in your office i tell you that again today i am concerned that that is not what is happened that since you took over his director you cleaned house or forced out senior leaders across the bureau in particular targeting those that worked on investigations of president trump the former acting director has just sued you for firing him for political reasons so did a leader in the dc field office and the well respected leader of the salt lake city office was pushed out last month leaving that office shorthanded at a particularly difficult time i am worried that these actions compromise the bureau's ability to keep americans safe hundreds of agents have resigned you are lowering application standards to fill vacancies you have reassigned large numbers of agents to work on immigration and street crime issues other law enforcement agencies can handle perhaps more effectively with the fbi but i am concerned that this compromises the bureau's ability to address national security risks uniquely its capability in fact you have shut down the office of integrity and compliance which makes sure that agents act in a lawful and ethical way and reassigned staff away from domestic terrorism investigations exactly at a moment i think we are all concerned about it i also have to ask you came before the appropriations committee in may and told us you wanted a half a billion dollar budget cut for the fbi literally an effort to defund the police i am grateful for the work of the men and women of the fbi they have done great work this year in dollarware partnering with the dover police department to support human trafficking partnering with the middle town police department on arm robbery and carjacking and it is urgent i think that we fix the direction and the prioritization within the fbi and i wish we could focus on those efforts today but i am seeing an fbi leadership more focused on social media cloud and on political revenge than on fighting crime director have you ever ordered that an fbi employee be terminated because he or she worked on an investigation into president trump uh center thank you one quick correction for the record there is 280 and being investigations i give the incorrect number to center holly thank you understood um as far as a lot of your statement i disagree with it i am happy to address it but the only way generally speaking an individual is terminated at the fbi is if they have violated the growth of office violated the law or failed upholed to standards that we need them to have at the fbi so those who say that they have been fired because of working on investigations into president trump are lying or misrepresent well those matters are alleged in litigation which is ongoing so i cannot comment on those specifically could you comment on why you fired former acting fbi director drisco i cannot because it is ongoing litigation could you say now definitively under oath that the rank and file agents who were assigned to work january six cases will not be terminated because that is what they were assigned to do i have said it before and i have said again your case assignment as i was given case assignments when i was a young prosecutor does not dictate your career or your termination thank you then let me go to the appropriations question in may you testified before the subcommittee on which i served defending the president's request that we slash the fbi's budget by about five hundred million dollars the day before you testified the opposite in front of the house where are we in terms of the budget request senator gram earlier said if you are requesting more funding for more agents let us know we are nearing the end of the fiscal year in front of the committee on which i serve here in the senate your request was for a reduction of hundreds of millions of dollars where are we where we are on the budget cycle is we at the fbi are in support of the president's budget and we are in support of eliminating waste fraud and abuse we have already identified tens of millions of dollars of duplicative contracts that the fbi was spending on software and private sector engagements we have also identified duplicative workloads so we are transitioning those folks out of doing the same thing twice over and into the field and that is my focus right now and the move of the fbi headquarters is also going to save the fbi three and a half billion dollars in the american taxpayers so we are focused on eliminating waste fraud and abuse and as i told senator gram if we are are i will go back and talk to my team and if we need more we will let you know are you planning any additional reductions in forest director no how many vacancies are you currently trying to fill within the agents in terms of the 18 11 ranks there is a few hundred open vacancies that we have funded and so we are filling all of those with our hybrid 18 11 program and our new recruitment program and i think a lesser amount of ias in sos so if hundreds of agents have retired or taken the fork in the road offer and you have vacancies but you are requesting 500 million less how does having fewer fbi agents help you tackle violent crime and address our national security issue just to put it in perspective senator sorry i mean to cut you off if we had this 500 million we have done the math it would take us 14 years to onboard every vacancy that is on the books currently at the fbi because we cannot hire these folks and train them overnight it is a years-long process so we are currently focused on recruiting the best and filling the positions to the best of our needs and we even if we had this extra money would not be able to hire them overnight we are looking for where the need is greatest where in the country we need to send them and how we can change the training requirements which is why i am thrilled to have police officers they might not have a college degree but they got the street smarts and the cops smarts to become fbi agents and that is what we want let me turn to section 702 when you testified in front of the c.j.s. of committee we talked about this issue you told me you were in favor of reauthorizing fisa section 702 when it expires next year right so long as the reforms implemented last year reforms like better training for agents and real consequences for inappropriate searches of americans communications were maintained you also said that you had some ideas about how to make section 702 better going forward can you give me an update on the fbi's implementation of these reforms and the direction you think it should go absolutely i think you are referring to the query process and if you are not let me know but any instance of abuse or mistakes that were made in the query process have now been changed it used to be you can make multiple those mistakes and continue to access the query database system i have changed that if you make a mistake you are immediately sidelined or review is conducted and if it was an actual mistake i.e. there should have been s on the end of that name and there was not and we put you back in but we have to review those matters so that is happening and if there was an intentional mistake you have no more access to the 702 query system in its database so we have also done an audit of the entire 702 system and the query databases and now we are nearly 100% of the audit and i think we found one or two i will have to get back to you quote unquote mistakes within that system which are currently being reviewed thank you you had told me in may that you would send me updated statistics about the section 702 searches of americans data i have not received it when will i get them i will work with my team to get that to center and frankly in may when you were testifying that you were implementing these reforms you were also closing down the office of internal auditing at the fbi now that was the office created in the first term administration to improve the bureau's compliance with section 702 how is that working out how how can you continue to advocate for robust several liberty protections but shut down the office that was created to enforce those safeguards help me understand this absolutely senator this is a great example of sort of duplicative work both there was two divisions in the fbi working on this and all we did was the inspection division which is the leader in this query system and this audit system has now been given the single source mandate to conduct these so the oi a it is elimination is just taking folks who are working there and were experts in it and folded in under the inspection division and then taking other folks that we did not need because we had enough manpower and pushing them elsewhere in the fbi i am concerned about the rise in threats against members of our judiciary what are you doing with the u.s. marshals service to help protect our federal judges and with state and local judicial systems to help provide some of the expertise of the fbi and protecting them as well i share a concern senator we have 35 open investigations 17 against federal judges and the remainder against state court judges and threats that they have received and as you know federally there is a specific statute which prohibits that so we are working up those cases and referring them to prosecution where we can meet the threshold for evidence in your written testimony you referenced how counter u.a.s legislation expires and we need to resolve the conflict and jurisdiction and authority i agree this is an urgent concern i have heard from state and local law enforcement about it from the folks responsible for major events whether it is sports or concerts or public events given the tragic increase in political violence i am very concerned about the misuse of drones and the potential of there being a catastrophic catastrophic event what could we do to address this challenge well obviously reauthorizing the capabilities that we have under the counter a u.a.s program but just to highlight what the fbi specifically doing we have been giving the mandate to work with dhs to secure not just a club world cup that we had by the way which which occurred in 32 matches across the country without any significant interest excuse me significant incident which we are proud of and we are taking that model for the next world cup and also the olympics but the reason i bring that up is because we pushed out our counter a u.a.s programs to address the security needs and that is where our focus is on events like that mr. director thank thank you for your testimony i look forward to working on actually solving criminal problems and reducing the extent to which what we are going back and forth about is more political and partisan points scoring and more actually solving crimes for the american people mr. director um you and the fbi working with uh state and local law enforcement officials and you talk have caught the assassin of mr. charlie car because that right we have a suspect yes sir and you did that within 48 hours did you not 33 hours 33 hours congratulations we have had other political assassinations back in uh back in june an assassin assassinated representative melissa hoffman mr. hoffman the senator john hoffman and mrs. hoffman and minnesota uh u and the fbi and minnesota state and local law enforcement officials caught the assassin within 48 hours did you not i believe that timeline's correct senator congratulations sometimes we we uh we missed the forest for the trees good work did did mr. carcass assassin act alone as i have said since the beginning senator it is very much an ongoing investigation and i cannot speak to the state charges that is for the state to address on their own but we are providing them with the same investigatory findings reporting the department and as i noted to senator i believe it was uh cornon or holly that there are a number of individuals that are currently being investigated and interrogated and a number yet to be investigated and interrogated specific to that chat row so we are very much in our ongoing posture of investigation so others could have been involved yes sir okay um i ask you this last time you were here okay as you remember mr. peter struck and miss leesa page yes sir they were mr. struck was an fbi agent this page was an fbi and all your they were both uh very aggressive anti-trump political activists who allowed their political opinions to affect their work at the fbi is that a fair i believe their text messages and the testimony that was secured by the oig and doj speak cells in fact um mr. struck and miss page we are having an extramarital affair and at one point miss page texted mr. struck quote trump is not ever going to be president right right mr. struck replied no no he will not we will stop it end quote um miss page resigned from the fbi mr. struck was fired they promptly sued the federal government and the fbi and justice department for releasing their emails which reveal all this the fbi settled that lawsuit for 1.2 million dollars gave mr. struck 1.2 million dollars cash gave mr. page he resigned she was not far she resigned she quit gave her 800 000 dollars who if the fbi made that decision to give them money uh that settlement was reached in the biden administration when my predecessor was the director who you saying the a chris right did the only people that can decide that settlement are the attorney general in conjunction with the director and the administration okay so you are telling me that attorney general garland and director ray decided to give them the money yes right yes sir okay now when when you uh when you you took over the fbi did you find instances of where uh under the biden administration the fbi had uh had weaponized the agency to push the uh political police president biden sorry the last part when you took over the fbi did you find instances of where uh the biden administration had politicized the fbi to uh prosecute this political agenda well i will not speak for other people have not been a target of that weaponization have not been a staffer on the house intelligence committee having had the justice department weaponized against me for making the findings and leading the investigation of russia gate i know what that feels like and that is why the fbi director i am committing to not ever have that ever happen again but i am also committed to fully investigating what was done and that matter is still ongoing so i i send i take it your answer yes yes sir and you are firing those people is that right anyone that politicizes their job at the fbi will not work at the fbi okay you have heard some of my colleagues either implicitly or or otherwise suggest that you have politicized the fbi to uh to to prosecute the political beliefs of president trump zedscherud i do not know how that can be true when the stats that i cited to include the 23,000 arrests 6,000 weaponcies 1600 gang and criminal enterprise organizations 4,700 children found and rescued more enough fentanyl c's to kill a third of america the men and women of the fbi are now in an apolitical mission and this is why the numbers are historic and so have you fired people because they voted for vice president hares i do not ask people who they vote for and neither does the fbi okay but you have given people politics or have said you are not many people in the fbi take polis the fbi does that all the time yes sir not yes for a long time is that correct decades all right i want to ask you about the upstein files have you uh have you seen the upstein files i have not reviewed the entirety of it myself but uh a good amount um would it be fair to say that mr. epstein trafficked young women including in some instances minors for sex to himself that was specifically the allegations in the 2018 indictment in this other district of new york okay who else did he trafficked these young women too in terms of what the investigation again going back to 2008 mr. kosta who limited the investigation and limited the search warrants and limited the parameters of the investigation the only thing we are able to speak to publicly because he was given a non prosecution agreement by mr. akosta is that first time period from i believe do not quote me on this 97 to 2001 ash and then when the trump administration courageous reopened it has to queue me for interrupting but i am gonna run out of time you have seen most of the files uh who if anyone did epstein trafficked these young young women too besides himself himself there is no credible information none if there were i would bring the case yesterday that he trafficked to other individuals and the information we have again is limited so the answer is no one for the information that we have in the files in the case file okay now uh president trump has deferred to the fbi in the department of justice uh with respect to the epstein recklessly says it is your call about releasing and and i understand that the department and the agency have decided to release them in cooperation with the house committee said correct yes sir uh so you are releasing them a little bit at a time is that correct we are releasing as much as we can um but we are limited by three different court orders and the department went back to each of those judges to waive those court orders or have them lifted and each of those judges declined will you release all of them or at least as many as you can we will release everything we are legally permitted to do so we are continuing to work with the house on the subpoena requests we have substantially required with it complied with it but we will continue to release whatever we are legally permitted to do so okay i strongly encourage you to do that cash i do not this is you's not gonna go away um and i think the central question for the american people is this they know that epstein trafficked young women for sex to himself they want to know who if anyone else he trafficked these young women too and that is a very fair question i want to know that answer and uh i i think you are going to have to to do more to satisfy the american people's understandable curiosity in that regard mr chairman may i just respond to that i agree senator and what we have done and just to remind folks the epstein case files existed in the two prior administrations in the obama administration and the bind administration they did not release anything and there was president trump in the first administration that renewed charges against mr. epstein and i know it is a little complicated to understand uh but what exists in the epstein case files was a direct result of the limited search warrants from 2006 and seven which hamstrung future investigations because of the non-prosycution agreement and multiple administrations had the opportunity to look at the entirety of that case file and recommend prosecutions against anyone that was trafficked under mr. epstein and anyone that participated in that trafficking and the only person to bring charges was the prior administration against mr. epstein now i am not saying that others were not trafficked and others were not involved what i am telling you is that based on the information we have and we have continuously publicly asked for the public to come forward with more information if there is will look at it but based on credible information we have released all credible information and the information that the department of justice in the fbi never releases is information on investigations that are not credible and we do not release the names of victims who were not credible but at the same time we do not release the names of victims who were credible and so the infirm that is by law and so the information we are releasing now is historic and it is also to the maximum capacity that the law allows and i know that is not going to satisfy many many many people but if they wanted it done right then the investigation from its origination should have been done right and he should not have been given a get out of jail free card to do jail on the weekends for 12 hours a day and he should have been investigated fully for the entirety of his crime and criminal enterprise not just from 1997 to 2001 senator brumasal thank you mr. patelle thank you mr. chairman director patelle thank you for being here today you will recall well in january at your confirmation hearing before this committee i raised the prospect of politically motivated retaliation and you promised me as you did other members of this committee quote every fbi employee will be held to the absolute same standard and no one will be terminated for case assignments you went on to tell me quote all fbi employees will be protect against political retribution and you assured one of my colleagues that you would honor the internal review process of the fbi i am not going to miss words you lied to us in the short time that you have been fbi director you presided over a rash of retaliatory firing three fbi agents have recently sued you they are fbi agents with 60 years between them of distinguished service rescuing hostages saving kids from predators dismantling drug cartels and their allegations their civil allegations are a searing indictment of your tenure as fbi director but it is not just those three the fbi agents association has said that your actions quote distract agents from their work foster fear that their assignments could cost them their careers either now or under the next administration and increase the risk of criminal and national security threats by undermining unity and morale within the bureau and quote this association as you know is voluntary it represents 14,000 members 90% of all the active agents these are your employees saying that your performance has been unqualified and unfit and there is mounting evidence that these retaliatory firings were the result of direction from the white house there have been instances in the past here history of the bureau of political interference and political direction from the director's office but not the kind of institutional interference that we are seeing from the white house right now i am going to ask you has anyone from the white house contacted you about personnel decision i completely disagree with your entire premise that i have lied or misleading the fbi if i were the results that i announced today by the men and women of the fbi and the historic records we are doing to keep this country safe would not be possible the men and women of the fbi are responding to our leadership and this administration's priorities the only way people get terminated the fbi is they fail to meet the muster of the job and their duties and that is where i will leave it and you accusing me of lying is something i do not take lightly but i am not going to get into a tit for tat with you well let me just ask you to answer my question has anyone from the white house contacted you about personnel decisions generally speaking we always discuss with the white house omb during the budget process how many personnel we need who we need where answer is yes for budgetary purposes and the fire people agents because they participated in investigations of the president i do not receive directions to do that as anybody i make decisions as anyone asked you to do it the best information is yes you have taken suggestions and directions from the white house in firing qualified agents any termination at the fbi was a decision that i made based on the evidence that i have as a director of the fbi and it is my job and i am like a shy away from it and as you stated those are allegations and that is an ongoing litigation so they will have their day in court so we the allegations are not just in that lawsuit director pratel and i think your testimony confirms that in fact you have taken direction from the white house i do not get those preliminary firing it literally does not acknowledge that in fact they have been in contact with you about personnel the white house has been do not put words in my mouth around the record the white house like any administration contacts his agencies on the budgeting process and where it needs personnel and where the mission priorities are that always happens if they did not do that they would be advocating the responsibility to law enforcement i will always work with my partners in the chain of command at the department of justice in the white house to ensure that this fbi is delivering the results we are delivering to include the lowest murder rate in modern us history to include the most fentanyl seizures in modern us history to include the most life saved and the most children found in modern us history that is a working fbi that is not a failing fbi let us move on to a related area in white house discussions have you been asked or directed by the white house or others to engage in a crackdown on political groups or organizations nonprofits after the murder of charlie kirk to direct at it political organizations no i have been asked by my chain of command to properly root out criminal activity wherever it is in whatever investigation we are conducting that is what we are doing have those distinctions about whom you are going to target been based on direction from the white house nobody gives me a list on who to target my targeting list is from the men and women at the fbi have you talked about investigating certain groups nonprofits or foundations or institution whatever those investigations are they are ongoing and i am not going to get into those have you used polygraphs to determine loyalty of agents no have you committed that you will respect the first amendment rights of agents i have wildly committed to respecting the first amendment rights of agents but at the fbi you have to balance your first amendment rights with your mission have you imposed any sort of loyalty test in the course of using polygraphs or in any of the other personnel decisions polygraphs have been utilized at the fbi for decades they will continue to be utilized in the fashion by the professionals that minister them have you asked under the polygraph test about individuals loyalty or about their voting records or any kind of past statement just to make it abundantly clear i do not tell the professionals how to conduct polygraphs or what questions to ask they make those decisions and i as a director of the fbi never ask anyone who they voted for have you investigated donors to a political party simply because they are donors simply based on that fact alone no have you investigated donors for another reason many donors may be involved in criminal enterprises and criminal activities and those individuals will be investigated can you commit to make public the epstein files that so far have not been released if this committee is able to review them on a classified basis i think this is an important distinction the epstein case file is not classified to my understanding so we are providing what we legally can and we are going to give congress what we are legally permitted to do so to the maximum extent of the law will you enable the chairman and the ranking member to review them on a classified basis that does not make any sense if the materially epstein file is not classified there is no basis for a classified project the confidentiality of them if they were able to review them on a on a classified basis if anyone in this room can get the multiple district court judges to lift their court protective orders in the ceilings we will happily provide you with more information are you in favor of merging the dea and the atf that is not something for me to comment on well those agencies work with you do not they with me not for me or you in favor of orienting the fbi toward a national police function as opposed to the enforcement of federal law the fbi does enforce federal law across the country that is what we do but is not it a fact that you have told the leadership of the fbi that you view it as moving toward a local and state police function no we are prioritizing working with our local and state partners and they will tell you that that has never happened with this much engagement in the history that they have been serving as local law enforcement officers i believe local cops are the best intelligent source and the best understanding of their communities and i folded in my fbi agents under that direction to work with them to get the job done thank you mr chairman for the fourth time today i want to remind people that my oversight has made clear that director raise fbi was politicized i have released a trove of records to prove it not only today but in past days i have also said some fbi personnel who has been fired retaliated against my whistleblowers and i do not remember my democratic colleagues defending my whistleblowers when their careers were ruined senator schmitt thank you mr chairman before i get into the thrust of my comments and questions director i want to thank you in our meetings prior to your confirmation during your confirmation we talked about your desire to get more agents out into the field out of washington and take on violent crime and you fulfilled that st. louis received the largest permanent per capita infusion of fbi agents anywhere in the country and i know it is not an only an isolated event but we certainly appreciate you are honoring your commitment to do that and i know there is a lot of great opportunities ahead to take on violent crime which you have highlighted many of the successes in your introductory comments it is obviously no secret that this hearing takes place in the wake of a horrific american tragedy the assassination of charlie kirk for those of us who knew him i know you did too it is still sort of difficult to put into words what a tragic law set is not just for his family but for our country for free speech for a belief that we can have a free exchange of ideas and he was quite literally shot in the throat and an attempt to silence him and take and take his life and so you have this task now of this investigation there is been an arrest but i think that we face even larger crisis that law enforcement alone cannot tackle alone it is a crisis that is culminated in the assassination of charlie but it does not end there it is ever i think every bit present right now and the challenge is greater than i quite frankly i would have imagined seeing some of the comments that have taken place after the assassination and something that i think is a country we have to reckon with and it is something deeper much deeper than a rejection of law and order or the norms of civil society we have entered a very dangerous time i think in our country and that should be clear to everyone political violence is a sign of a deep and corrosive sickness in any society but in america today the problem is this not political violence in the abstract it is the specific kind of political violence which is overwhelmingly driven by a specific set of actors and groups none of this emerged out of thin air over the past week leaders from across the political spectrum have come out and forcefully condemn charlie's murder and political violence more broadly for that we are all very grateful we should be grateful there have been calls to unite and come together in the wake of charlie's murder and i want to do that i do some day i pray that we can be united as a country again and go forward together as a one people and under one flag but we are not united upstream from the dehumanization and demonizing political violence and rhetoric tearing apart our country is a divide on how we view america and americans is america good is america evil is there something inherently special about western civilization or is this 2000 year project rotten to the core and if it is something worth fighting for which i believe how do we do it with words and ideas like charlie did or with fire bombs and assassins bullets political violence is always wrong period full stop it does not matter which side in the name of any ideology or cause it is wrong but in america today political violence is not a problem that falls equally upon both sides we have to be honest about this we must reject an attempt to paint it as some kind of random phenomenon with no particular creator ideology a kind of spontaneous insanity which takes place outside of any broader social context and has no pattern at all that is wrong so free speech yes political political violence no but we have to be honest about what is happening already we are hearing people talk about charlie's assassination in those terms we are told that we cannot possibly know what drove a killer to plan and carry out a murder the most prominent conservative activist in america but that is a lie we do know the facts are plain and clear and we have to speak truth in this moment or there is no other side of the mountain the vast majority of americans are against political violence but there is a vocal active minority that encourages and celebrates it and that minority is overwhelmingly on the left just last week a ugov poll found that a quarter a full 25% of those people who describe themselves as very liberal say it can be justified for citizens to use violence to achieve political goals less than 3% of very conservative americans say the same that is too many that is 3% too many but we are lying if we think that this is a bullseye thing it is not we have to confront it and you are going to have an important job of rooting out these terrorists this is an ideology that runs very deep the numbers are virtually identical to the ones i just noted when it comes to whether or not it is okay to celebrate the deaths of people whom we disagree with and while large majorities in both parties were opposed to celebrating political violence democrats overall were nearly twice as likely as republicans to believe that it is usually or always acceptable to celebrate the death of a public figure they oppose what in the hell is going on earlier this year a poll found that more than 55% of people on the left believe that it would be at least some let justified to murder donald trump these are not just some abstractions on a page these are our fellow citizens how can we come together with people who believe these things we have all seen the flood of posts on social media over the past week not just a fringe few but thousands upon thousands of people gleefully celebrating a father of two young children getting gunned down in broad daylight i wish i would not have seen that video i wish my kids would not have seen that video blue sky the left wing alternative to x was so overwhelmed with these posts that the platform was forced to issue a statement warning its users to stop glorifying the murder and it was not just a random it was not just random social media trolls it was journalists elite college professors and even politicians all but saying charlie's assassination was justified because of what he thought because of what he said we saw the flood of hit pieces the most powerful media outlets in the nation dishonestly attacking and villainizing charlie for the most vicious possible terms how can you ask us to unite under that there can be no unity between good and evil somebody has to win this thing and as a country we have to absolutely reject it and do not tell me it is both sides it did not happen in a vacuum over the past decade we have seen an explosion of political violence not just one off lone wolf attacks but organized systemic political violence at a mass scale it is not organic it is the offspring of a dark and clandestine system funded in part with our own tax dollars winning with a large network of foundations in geo's activist organizations and front groups this system lurks behind every radical leftist movement in our nation today the george soros empire empire has financed a vast ecosystem of radicals all working together dropping off bricks at riots to unleash a tidal wave of violently anarchists on our streets and to prop it up and an army of researchers and experts and journalists and propagandists who downplay the political violence i am going to ask you because i do not have a ton of time and i would point out we have heard years years of the left their loudest voice is calling anyone on the right extremist extremist mega-republicans fascist nazis an existential threat to democracy check yourself it do not give me this both sides both shit mr. director i want to ask you tell me if each one of the following perpetrators or legit perpetrators were acting from a left wing or right-wing political violence the man who to kill who tried to kill republican congressman at the congressional baseball practice nearly killing houseman jordan leaders steves gleece left wing or right wing violence sorry i believe it was a left wing ideology okay burn down cities during the summer of love in the george floyd riots left wing violence or right wing violence sir i will rely on you on these i do not have off the top of my head okay left wing the walkiesha christmas parade massacre left wing or right wing violence left wing the lee zealot in stabbing attempt left wing or right wing left wing the covenant school shooting in nashville left wing or right wing left wing the butler pennsylvania assassination attempt on president trump left wing or right wing left wing the trump international west palm beach assassination attempt left wing the abundant light christian school shooting left wing the united care uh ceo's murder left wing tesla's burned key damaged fire bomb left wing left wing the murders at the israeli is embassy left wing the ice facilities fire bomb left wing the minnesota catholic school shooting left wing the anti white charlatan in north carolina stabbing left wing the attempted you taught new news state fire bombing left wing and now of course the culmination of this file trend a left wing assassination of president or of charlie kirk so do not give me this both sides if we want to get to unity let us be honest let us be honest free speech yes political violence no but let us be honest senator ronald thank you mr. chairman there i can tell just like the rest of the federal government there have been significant personnel changes at the fbi since president trump took office i want to better understand the scope of the turnover and the changes occurring at the fbi since january twenty twenty twenty five how many fbi employees have retired resigned been fired or otherwise separated from employment i need a number we will get your number what is the number you do not have it not off the top of my head and i want to get you the right number what is surprised you to know that it is in the probably in the thousands like five thousand i do not think that number is not here you do not know next question how many special agents or analysts have left or been fired from the fbi since january twenty twenty twenty five say we will get you the numbers and anyone that retires is of their own volition and anyone that is terminated at the fbi as i have said before is done so because they have failed to meet the standards and i will pull their loyalty to the council you will show you say next question how many executive assistant directors assistant directors or special agents in charge have left or been fired from the fbi since january twenty twenty twenty five again people leaving on their own accord or terminations were done by the standard set at the fbi that have been carried out with this question i am getting to the leadership of the fbi and you do not have that answer next question which field office division or directorate has lost the most personnel since january twenty twenty twenty five and uh what do you have the answer to that question yeah actually every single field office in the country including hawaii has received a plus-up of fbi agents because we are pushing them out to the field okay so you are telling me that no field office division or directorate has lost any personnel since january twenty twenty twenty five that is your answer in hawaii there is been a plus-up in every single state that i am looking at we have allocated a plus-up for field offices across the country so that the fbi can continue in the historic achievements it is done in these last seven months when you are talking about firings you are looking for a media hit and a fundraising clip and i am not going to give it to you it does not matter i am under what basis they left i just want to know how many have left and i think your testimony is nobody has left next question nope that is not my testimony you asked it one time i answered it one time you did not get the answer you wanted for your clip question asking it and i told you i get you the numbers but you can keep asking it which field office division or directorate has gained the most personnel since january twenty twenty twenty five you noted that there have been plus-ups so which offices have received these plus-ups the greatest allocation that i believe was given to california and then florida where were those offices california and florida thank you director patel you often refer to fbi agents as cops all of us democrats and republicans supports the police officers who keep our communities safe but while our states cities counties and towns all employ police officers to protect our communities congress has empowered and equip the fbi to take on missions that local police cannot especially taking on terrorists hackers and spies i would like to assess how well the fbi is able to handle it is specialized missions under your leadership the fbi is the nation's lead federal law enforcement agency for investigating and preventing acts of domestic and international terrorism and yet the executive assistant directors in charge of the fbi's national security and intelligence branches were both forced out at the beginning of the year who replaced them in those positions excellent qualified personnel to lead the mission of resting twenty three thousand violent criminals this year alone that is twice as many as before the places i am not going to give you any names so you can attack them why not so you can attack them i am not doing that the people sitting in those seats are extremely qualified to handle the job you would not have the results of personnel who we would not have the reduction of violence in the state of hawaii if we did not allocate the resources this year fbi counterterrorist special agents and investigators were reassigned to assist with immigration enforcement reportedly these counterterrorism experts were returned to the jobs they trained for in late january after iran threatened to retaliate for our strikes on their nuclear facilities have those experts remained in the jobs they trained for since that time yes or no fbi agents primary responsibility is exactly what they are assigned to do we always work with our energy to see part to their position you are not going to let me answer why do not you just do your salil ki in the four and a half minutes you i am not asking for a yes so a grace just say yes or no are those people who are returned to their jobs still on those jobs yes they never left what was that they never left their primary job it is a surge of resources and law enforcement working with the inner agency to combat violent crime and reduce violent crime and historic proportions that is your testimony okay director but tell the fbi is also the lead federal agency for investigating cyber attacks and cyber intusions both by foreign nation states and by non-state hacker groups since president trump's inauguration the executive assistant director and charge of the criminal and cyber branch and the head of the fbi cyber division have both left the fbi what are the names of the people who replace them in those positions the cyber branch is one of the most impressive at the fbi 409 arrests year 169 convictions that is a 42 percent increase from the same time last year so any suggestion that the fbi cyber division is not operating at full capacity and better than ever before the leadership at the branch is implementing these changes necessary to attack the cyber and ransomware infrastructure operators you know why there is important i want to know who has those positions since they people who originally were there supremely qualified individuals have those positions supremely qualified individuals who are they what are the names you are not yet you do not know special agents who investigate cyber cyber crime were also reassigned for immigration enforcement have those expert investigators returned to their duties yes or no all agents remained on their primary duties while surging to to allocate resources for interagency operations for the homeland security test forces across this country are you am i what see i am not getting the the yes or no answers i get all this explanation so there you go no you get the work are you in women the fbi are doing you do not want that additional personnel cuts to the cyber division in the future the only people that will be terminated the fbi will be those that violate their oath of office fail to meet the high standards of the fbi director patel the fbi is meant to be the tip of the spear and combatting terrorism against the united states from both foreign and domestic sources it is also our lead agency in fighting the hackers who target our businesses and critical infrastructure but instead of a specialized role fighting these kinds of terrorists hackers and spies you have the fbi playing the role of local police and helping with immigration enforcement i am going to move on to my you know there you have been asked some questions about changes to your hiring standard and including college degrees and possibly the age but you know one question i had is that you are now requiring applicants to be able to do a certain kind of pull ups which a lot of women cannot because of physiological differences are you requiring these kinds of pull ups we are requiring a physical program at bftc equanico because fbi agents carrying guns in the field have to chase down bad guys and do really hard work the physical fitness standards of those agents so are you requiring these lines of pull ups we are requiring everybody to pass the 1811 standards at bftc if you want to chase down a bad guy and put him in handcuffs you better be able to do a pull up the reason i ask is that there are concerns about whether or not being able to do these kinds of harsh pull ups is a really required of fbi agents doing one pull up is not harsh and there are always medical exemptions to that i am gravely concerned by the state of the api under your control and in fact you are willing to take a cut in your agency of almost half a billion dollars so the fbi is losing dedicated employees decades of expertise and specialization leading to loss to early retirements, firings and reassignments to immigration enforcement or conducting local police work thousands have already left for as long as you remain as the head of the api i fear the number of departures and summary fires will continue to grow. i miss your patel before the vote on your nomination of this committee i noted that your most significant qualification this is not just something that i noted but others your most significant qualification was your 100% loyalty to president trump and i fear that that continues to be the motivating factor in your position as fbi director thank you mr chairman. madam mr chairman. very good patel did you see the thing you wanted to say now that is an entire falsehood you can delete my 16 years of government service to multiple administrations all you want the fact is that i was a public defender i was a national security prosecutor i was a house intelligence staffer i was a deputy director of intelligence as a chief of staff to the department of defense and the secretary of defense i led the counterterrorism missions for the white house those are just some of the jobs i held in my 16 year career there was no loyalty then there is no loyalty now to anything but the constitution senator brey yes well before i began i want to thank senator heral no for what she said acknowledging that there are physical differences between men and women talking about that women would not be able to do as many pull-ups and i think that she was making a case here that there should be different standards there is a thing called title 9 and this is why we continue to say we should have biological men and men's sports and biological women and women's sports and so i look forward to utilizing that to talk to all of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe they will stand with us and helping us protect women's sports i think she made a great argument there for it moving on to today um director patel thank you for being here thank you for your commitment to making sure that america is safe again thank you for doing that coast to coast and with nr cities i certainly look forward to talking about that and talking about your historic gains in these areas but i would be more rest if i did not begin my questioning with you about the horrific events that we have seen over the last week obviously our heart breaks um not only for erica and and charlie's two children and for parents and families but for america and for those of us who knew him um you being chief among those so just my sincere condolences and thank you for the steps that you and the fbi have taken to make sure that we have someone with them custody and we are going to be able to to move forward with that but if you look over the last you know since last summer alone we had two assassination attempts on the president we have had an arson attack on the governor of a governor shapiro there in pennsylvania you have the murder of the state representatives melissa hortman and her husband and minnesota along with the shooting of state senator john hoffman and his wife um several anti-semitic attacks several attacks on um christians that were noted by senator holly um uh you know we had the killing of two israeli embassy staffers here in dc the june fire bombing in col-colorado we could go on and on and we saw a culmination um as senator schmitz said with the brutal assassination of charlie kirk last week i appreciate you committing to both senator holly and senator kennedy talking about making sure that all that are involved are held accountable i think that is critically important and i think that america needs that transparency i want to read you some words of vice president jadey bans he said if we want to stop political violence like what happened to charlie kirk we have to be honest about the people who are celebrating it and the people who are financing it my question to you is in light of charlie's murder and all of the things that we have just referenced and have been talking about today what steps is the fbi taking to more aggressively crack down on those who promote encourage finance fund these types of engagements and this type of political violence um thank you senator for your kind words so in terms of how we crack down on the root cause of this violence uh for now putting aside the ideological motivations and how they got there the monetary issue is a real issue and as i have said before we follow the money so we work with our partners at the treasury department to trace where the money came from how these individuals paid for the training they received or the platforms they were using and also how these individuals collectively got together in whatever groups they were on on whatever social media sites they were on to utilize clickbait to make money for their ideology and so to trace all of those we are using not just in the charlie's investigation but others lawful process and serving 2703 to de-orders on any entity that is related in any way financially to any of these criminal acts of violence and we are going to hold them accountable with our partners at the department of justice excellent uh i would love to stay abreast of that and just we must get to the bottom of it we must follow the money someone is funding this discourse do you believe obviously there are people here um unfortunately american citizens that may be engaged in that but do you also believe that some of this may be coming from overseas yes okay let us let us get to the bottom of it and let us let us make it stop yes madam i want to ask you about the dobs decision so we know that it was leaked in may of 22 and then we had the marshall service say we found nothing in january of 23 i find that absolutely mind-boggling um that we cannot figure out who leaked that opinion we know it was done an attempt to undermine the process um and then the intimidation of the justices occurred after that tell me what you can do as fbi director to help us get to the bottom of what happened and actually hold someone accountable um for their actions so i cannot speak to what the marshals did and how they conducted their investigation i can tell you generally speaking the fbi has taken over the investigation on the leak because it was such a detrimental leak uh you commit to getting to the bottom of it we will we are utilizing the full resource of the fbi's we usually do on leak investigations and we will make sure our results are public at the appropriate time we we need answers um i want to talk about child sexual exploitation uh thank you thank you thank you for making protecting our youth your top priority we know that that is the the greatest gift that we have um that is our greatest treasure here in the united states as the next generation and finally we have an fbi director that is putting that at the top of his list can you tell me um the steps and the different initiatives i have heard you talk about a couple of them you have mentioned seven six four amongst another other other things tell me what you are doing and specifically i want to know about when it comes to sex extortion so as a parent who is raising children right now teenagers and you are looking at what is happening whether you know people are snapping photos and then what is happening online i have had a number of parents sit in front of me telling me terrible heartbreaking stories about their children ultimately taking their own life because of being blackmailed i want to know what steps are you taking to get to the bottom of that and to absolutely and this if this were happening in a storefront mr director that store would be shut down no matter where it was coast to coast and yet we continue to allow these things to happen and we have got to have a more target approach um when we are looking at this and so what are you doing uh to protect children and specifically sex extortion so in our vk initiative our violent crimes against children is our umbrella enterprise um operations hub for things like operation enduring freedom and operation not forgotten and operation justice and in things like that those are producing the results that i told you about 1500 child brothers arrested 300 human traffickers arrested 4700 children identified and saved a 35% increase from year to date last year alone but on specifically on your sex extortion question senator that is a problem that we are seeing explode on generous of ai and private sector and social media companies and what we are doing is engaging with nicknick the national center for missing exploiting children because this once that alone should probably cause great pause they have seen a 1,325% increase in generative ai leading to sex extortion and child sexual abuse that cannot be counter-manded by the fbi alone we have embedded people at nipnick out of have great partnership with them but what we need to do is what we did in the month of may and we are doing it over and over again we arrested 400 individuals in one month in one month search these individuals have prioritized the agents and intel analysts have never left that mission they are doing multiple missions at the same time that is what the fbi is called upon to do day in and day out and we will not stop doing two things at once but we need help from social media companies we need help from the private sector and the internet service providers that allow this generative ai to be hosted on their platforms we have got to get a resolution on that with our partners in congress in the private sector well we are definitely committed to working on that i know the people up here so you you let us know what tools you need and i know we have got several ideas that we look forward to pushing board and my remaining two minutes i want to talk to you about your historic results when it comes to crime in particular we have seen here in dc just a total transformation you mentioned to your you mentioned earlier 60% down and gun crime 60 70% down in car jackings you said 50% down in homicides to name a few we have a success story and we appreciate president trump's leadership on all of this we have a per success story in alabama where the alabama law enforcement agency so alia they just marked their one year anniversary of the metro area crime suppression unit there in montgomery it is a coordinated effort with alia with our attorney general with montgomery pd and our sheriff montgomery county sheriffs they are they have seen a 30% drop in violent crime and a 19% drop in overall crime so it is actually producing results is this type of interagency connectivity that i think ultimately is going to lead us to safer cities and safer streets i know that you are committed to that committed to working with your partners you said earlier you have elevated sheriffs and police officers there to the seventh floor thank you for doing that i am grateful for the men and women of alabama and uniform that have made this happen and want to know how is the fbi working to collaborate in these types of ways across our country to make sure that we have even greater success stories to tell well the collaboration is happening at a redstone arsenal in alabama we bring 4,000 students through a redstone arsenal for training every year in terms of our future plans in the next few years we will bring 13,000 students a year through alabama's redstone arsenal and by students i mean fbi employees i mean sheriffs i mean police chiefs i mean cops i mean intel analysts because that is their future gem of how we are going to train local law enforcement and we are so thankful for the dedication of resources to that facility and i encourage everyone to go down there and take a look because if you want to see where they have the guys going and how we are going to train the future it is happened at quantico and redstone we are very proud of it and thank you so much for your leadership senator boca thank you mr. chairman mr. patel i want to start off where we left off last time i asked you whether you had any knowledge or discussions about removing fbi officials and installing political personnel before you were confirmed to that position and i wonder did you then understand or have conversations with the white house about the intentions to do so before i was confirmed yes sir did i have discussions with the white house to remove fbi personnel yes no so you are saying that you had no discussions with the white house before you were in the position about the removal of any personnel from the agency as i was preparing for my confirmation hearing i had numerous discussions involving the type of people that would be employed and that those that were failing to meet the market the fbi would no longer be employed if i were confirmed. i think that mark had to do with loyalty to the trump administration. no you are wrong. okay i would like to revisit another subject from that hearing did you did you testify excuse me you did testify before the grand jury that president trump had declassified the documents at issue in the mar-a-lago classified documents case is that correct? i do not have the grand jury transcript that is why i released it whatever it says is the best event you know that is what you said to senator white house that your grand jury testimony was publicly released it has not been in fact in july a court denied a news outlets bid to get that transcript but you said but the court said quite clearly that you are free to discuss your grand jury testimony so i ask you again did you testify before the grand jury that president trump declassified the documents at issue in the mar-a-lago classified document case and that is why i took your invitation to work with the department in the court to have that transcript released and the transcript is the best evidence of what i said then. so you are saying right now this committee can have access to what you said before the grand jury to whatever was released and did my understanding senator that the department of justice released you would not go to understand the law let me finish you on i understand under rule six of the federal rules of procedure grand jury witness in this case you is not barred from sharing their grand jury testimony this is an oversight hearing this is germane to your integrity and credibility you know right now whether or not you testified that president trump declassified the documents at issue in the mar-a-lago classified documents case why are you refusing to answer that simple yes or no question right now because the premise of your question is inaccurate and there is no premise to my question but trying to get to an order of what is truth or not how do you know or how do you know what was asked in the grand jury if you were not there mr. persell this is a mockery you are making of this hearing and simple question if you have a question you are not a question you do not hear me you promise that quote all fbi employees will be protected against political retribution when i ask you are you aware of any plans or discussions to punish in any way including termination fbi agents were personnel associated with the trump administration you explicitly said under oath that you were not aware of any plans to punish fbi agents associated with criminal investigations of donald trump i do not believe you were truthful firing fbi employees based solely on the cases that they are investigating their case assignments is illegal and you know that a new lawsuit that is been discussed numerous times filed by three fbi officials alleges that you carried out donald trump's campaign of retribution in quotes against fbi employees for quote failure to demonstrate sufficient political loyalty one of those plaintiffs has been discussed today brian driscoll now we know 20 years of distinguished service to the fbi before you terminated him special agent in charge of fbi's newark field office where he operated with distinction metal of valor winner shield of bravery rewards he is a patriot you terminated driscoll via a letter dated october 8th 2025 and in that letter you said that you were firing him pursuant to article two of the constitution well you are not the president of the united states and so i am wondering under what authority you were allowed to terminate him that matters under litigation and i am not able to discuss it okay well discuss this did you have discussions with stephen miller about firing this particular person or about his continuance in the fbi not that i recall how often do you speak to stephen miller frequently on our homeland security task forces you frequently discussed with stephen miller about subjects other than homeland security task force issues correct i frequently talk to mr. miller about homeland security task forces has stephen miller ever given you his opinions on how to run your agency mr. miller's interagency operations are in valid over 60 fbi that is what we talk about so you frequently discuss your job and your responsibilities with stephen miller and pam bondi i imagine as well absolutely she is the attorney general understood okay donald trump promised to make us all safer you have pushed out senior fbi agents with decades of knowledge and experience in fact this is the first time in fbi history that neither the director nor the deputy director have any experience with the fbi you have shifted the agency's priorities primarily to pursuing donald trump's immigration enforcement agenda according to ice data the cato institute which is a conservative thinkpink found that 20 20% of all agents have been diverted from their work to do assist ice immigration enforcement 20% part of this operation is the work of mass law enforcement who jump out of cars snatch people off streets at churches schools and their jobs and hospitals have there been any fbi agents who investigate crimes against children that have been assigned to immigration enforcement yes or no premise of what you say is there been any fbi no no no no no no you do not get to say the america is not safe for under this i am not america is safer because of the assumption you are making a presumption of a pretty 700 children we have see 6000 weapons and you have you are a thousand miles of hell and have an fbi agents who investigate human trafficking have been reassigned to immigration enforcement you were not denying that fbi agents who are in the task force that fight against russian oligarchs have not been reassigned public correction squad reassigned people who defend us again defend children reassigned you are not denying that fbi time again attack my colleagues premises of questions as a way to not answer the question so let me end with this i believe you have made our country weaker and less safe i believe that we are more vulnerable to a major event and i pray to god it does not happen you have got it the bureau of institutional knowledge and expertise you fired or pushed out seasoned fbi officials many with more than 20 years of experience and we are working on cases that were critical you have been purging thousands of serious law enforcement officials who spent their careers keeping us safe only to lower hiring standards in order to find anyone to replace them and shockingly you admitted in this hearing to senator coons that it would take 14 years to fill the vacancies at your agency many are the result of your purge 20% of fbi agents are doing low level immigration enforcement instead of their mission critical work you have disbanded entire task forces that stop intellectual election interference foreign influence public corruption and who benefits from this will corrupt people benefit from it criminals benefit from it vladimir putin benefits from it and it really makes me wonder who you are looking out for it makes me think we cannot trust you as a nation you swear to release the epstein files but now you are withholding the epstein files you claim that you have a suspect in a serious assassination whoops then you do not have a suspect you know nothing about plans to remove fbi you are directly involved in those plans and the words of an ex-sbi official you are overseeing and i quote generational destruction of the nation's premier law enforcement agency mr. patel in just eight months you have assaulted the institutional integrity of the fbi but i know fbi field agents i have worked with them in newark no matter how truly bad you are you cannot undermine the legacy of agents who fight every day to keep us safe but you can tarnish the integrity of the agency and under at mine the agency's capacity i believe your failing failing as a leader and that your failure does have serious implications for the safety and security of americans in our families we are more vulnerable to domestic and foreign attack because of your failures of leadership i do not think you are fit to them the bureau but here's the thing mr. patel i think you are not going to be around long i think this might be your last oversight hearing because as much as you supplicate yourself to the will of donald trump and not the constitution of the united states of america donald trump has shown us in his first term and in this term he is not loyal to people like you he will cut you loose this may be the last time i have a hearing with you because i do not think you are long for your job but i am going to tell you this i pray for you i pray for you that you can step up and defend your oath defend the constitution and do a much better job of defending this country thank you mr. chair do you want to say yes sir that rant of false information does not bring this country together if you want to work on bringing this country it is my time not yours my god my god if you want to talk about biting this country it is i found you on your social media post it is my time to address you all you try all you want to do in this country not say your bout my time for one time sir you are the time it is over committee sir you do not tell me my time is over you know who belong to tell me what my time is you cannot lecture me you can tell me my time is you maybe the charge mr. chairman not afraid of you mr. chairman point of order senator booger i announced at the beginning of this meeting that this back and forth talking over each other does not work and i said if that happened i asked patel not to respond and i was going to give me some time after the senator's time was up to respond and that is he has the privilege to do that on interrupted mr. chairman one point go ahead mr. i have watched him talk over us and you have never once criticized him for us not even be able to get our questions out he has been rooted disrespectful to senator after senator and when the senators were not giving him a chance to answer i did not stop the senator either go ahead sir thank you mr. chairman if the fbi under my seven month leadership were failing this administration in this country why do we have 23,000 violent felons arrested this year alone a 20 a 200 excuse me a double increase from that time last year why is it that we have seized 6,000 weapons why have we found 1500 child predators and arrest them why have we have 300 human traffickers in jail why have we found and identified 4700 children why have we see 1600 kilograms of fentanyl in enough to kill a third of the american public a 25% increase alone from last year 88,000 kilograms of cocaine seized 7,000 kilograms of methe seized and that is just on our criminal operations in summer heat how is it possible that we are taking 8 kilograms off the streets of the cities in new jersey and preventing the deaths of 607,000 people this year alone a failure of the fbi and my leadership how is it that we have counterintelligence arrest already this year exceeding the numbers from the entirety of last year 33% increase in prc 83% in russia 60% in the ci space that it relates to iran and we have not even talked about ct the southern border of the northern border before senator cruz i kind of feel like a broken record today all this interest in fbi termination yet my college showed no intent or interest in when i my whistle blower suffered retaliation over the past years particularly the past four years indeed one whistle blower has alleged that brian driscoll's in subordination whether an ass uh whether an agent is on a hot button case or not they ought to be held accountable for misconduct and weaponization senator cruz thank you mr chairman you know i have to say it used to be that to see theater you had to go to the kennedy center uh now apparently you need only go to the senate judiciary committee uh and see our senate democrats berating the director of the fbi which okay it is not partisan politics is not new in the united states congress but what is remarkable is is what senator booker was berating director patella bow he was not berating him for failing to do his job but rather he was furious for director patella for successfully doing his job for four years the democrats under joe biden had an open border that undermined the safety of every single american they allowed 12 million illegal aliens to come into this country to invade this country and every single day americans were murdered women were raped children were assaulted by violent criminals that democrats released now director patella found senator booker's questioning really bizarre he asked you have you reassigned fbi agents from human trafficking to immigration issues director patella are the mexican cartels that are bringing people illegally into this country engaged in human trafficking yes sir what the hell does it mean to reassign someone from human trafficking to immigration the greatest human trafficking that the in the world has been over the last four years are our southern border it is modern day slavery that the democrats still defend they still defend those open borders mr. patella also said did you reassign fbi agents from protecting children to immigration how many children have you found that were victimized by the open borders of the previous administration 4,700 4,700 and yet oddly i do not hear a democrat here saying gosh thanks for protecting those kids 35 percent increase year to date last year all right i want to shift topics and i want to shift topics to what happened last week charlie kirk was assassinated he was assassinated because of his political views we are living in a time of enormous division and tragically hatred and hatred that manifested in evil that we saw last week now the fbi working in concert with state and local law enforcement apprehended what appears to be in all likelihood the murderer and you did so in just 33 hours so i want to start by just congratulating you and the fbi agents in state and local law enforcement for successfully apprehending the murderer in in less than a day and a half in the wake of that assassination we have seen far too many people on the left celebrating the assassination we have seen democrats we have seen activists sharing it on we have seen tragically teachers teachers in high schools teachers in elementary schools university professors cheering on the murder of charlie kirk you and i both knew charlie well he was a good friend he was an extraordinary man and i will say there is a great deal of discussion about what to do about it under our constitution under the bill of rights the first amendment speech is protected and that is true even for vile speech someone can stand up and say the most hateful thing and it is protected by the first amendment not seasoned clansmen can march in the streets and even though their speech is bigoted and horrible and racist the first amendment protects it conduct however is not protected by the first amendment particularly conduct that is violent conduct violent conduct that is threatening others that is harassing others that is injuring or in this case murdering others is most assuredly not protected by the first amendment and so i would encourage you and the fbi to focus on conduct now speech can direct speech can guide you to those engaged in conduct and i will say one question that i have in many hand and i recognize this is an ongoing investigation so i do not want you to say anything that would compromise the investigation but what can you tell us at this point about what evidence there exists of other individuals who may have had prior knowledge of this assassin's plans to murder charlie kirk on september 10th. generally speaking we have interviewed numerous people family members and friends including the partner to provide us with detailed history of the knowledge he may have had the suspect may have had prior to we are still mapping out who if anyone was involved as an accomplice as i said the investigation is ongoing we are also speaking to and going to interview numerous individuals online who were part of a chat group that was involved in this heinous assassination and we are also going to work with our state and local partners out in utah to find out what community organizations if any participated or had any foreknowledge of this information but it is very much ongoing i remind everybody that it is not even been a week since charlie's tragic death. is it accurate it is been widely reported that the assassin's roommate was a transgender man who was transitioning to be female and it is also been reported that they may have been romantic partners is that accurate? yes senator. and i assume the fbi is investigating it has also been reported that there were transgender chat rooms that may have had some awareness of the plan to commit this murder is that accurate as well? sorry can you repeat the question? it is been reported that there were chat rooms of transgender activists that indicated some degree of potentially a foreknowledge of this murder. we are still developing that. do you have any information the bullet casings had on them both and tifa and lgbt wording on them? do you have any indication of the source of those engravings and what inspired them? as to the actual source we are still developing that. i want to encourage you in the course of this investigation. absolutely go after anyone who aided and abetted but i want to more broadly encourage you follow the money. the violence we are seeing is not purely organic. there is i believe significant money that is spreading dissension that is spreading violence and tifa. do you believe antifa is a terrorist organization? i believe antifa is associated with a lot of violence in this country as to its designation. i will leave that to the appropriate authorities. so i would encourage the administration to designate antifa as a terrorist organization to go systematically after antifa that committed acts of violence all over the country. and the shell casings have multiple references to slogans that antifa has popularized. i believe there is considerable money funding and i would note that i have introduced legislation called the stop funders act. stop funders act would add rioting to the list of predicate offenses under rico. i believe the money should be tracked and prosecuted under rico and both the antifa and black lives matter riots of a couple of years ago and the pro-open border riots in los angeles and other cities of this past year. i believe there was significant money behind those riots. i am not the only person who noticed at the anti-semitic protest and violent protests on college campuses that many of the tents all matched. and so i would ask would it aid your ability to prosecute these matters if congress passed into law the stop funders act and if rioting was added to the list of predicate offenses for rico. yes. talk to me about the efforts of the fbi to go after the funders of the anti-semitic protest on college campuses, the pro-open border protests in cities and potential lgbt violence. talk to me about the efforts to go after the money of those who are funding and promoting violence. as i have always said senator, money does not lie and we have been following the money and so that is what we are doing issuing lawful process to organizations involved with criminal activity because the money's got to come from somewhere and it has to be funded somehow. so we have extensive investigations ongoing into numerous organizations that are related to violent criminal activity. cutting off the money will make america much safer and that is the core job of the fbi and i thank you for doing your job. sir, but you. thank you, mr. chairman. mr. chairman, i am glad to be on this committee and take our responsibility seriously to conduct oversight of the fbi. obviously, one of the most critical law enforcement agencies in the country. as senator klobuchar and others on this committee have reminded us. so last several months have provided far too many reminders of the political violence crisis in america today and the gun violence crisis in america today, including the tragic killing just last week. director patel, this committee takes seriously it is not just oversight role but recognizing the fbi's important role in protecting the public from gun violence while respecting constitutional rights. if you recall, this was a significant subject to area of my questioning during your confirmation hearing. the bureau plays a central role in enforcing federal firearm laws and showing the accuracy of background checks and monitoring trends like machine gun conversion devices and lost or stolen firearms. now during your confirmation hearing, you pledged that the fbi would enforce firearm laws fully and fairly, consistent with the second amendment. yet we continue to see a sharp rise in lost and stolen firearms reported by federal licensees. can you point to any measurable enforcement results like arrests, not just arrests, but also prosecutions or task force expansions since you became director. i will get those to you, senator. nothing you can share here today. no, i will get the full list to you. you came on to prepare today to respond to questions which you knew were important going back to your confirmation hearing. now the bureau has warned about the public safety threat posed by a machine gun conversion devices which converts semi-automatic weapons to automatic ones. can you at least reference what resources you are dedicating to this threat? absolutely, senator. part of tracking ghost guns, as you alluded to, is having a sustainable database which is huffed out of our seedjust division in west virginia. we have allocated more resources so that ffls can track and trace firearms that are stolen and make sure they do not get into the population. that is one of my primary concerns that we do not want stolen weapons anywhere near anything. the numbers continue to go up as reported by federal licensees. let me get to my next question on this topic. you previously stated that you had not reviewed fix-nix, a federal law that improves reporting to the national criminal background check system. eight months into your job, what concrete steps have you taken to ensure that nix records are complete, accurate and timely? that is actually a great question that we have dedicated a lot of resources to again at seedjust. the nix system has been trying to get to 100% within 15 minutes. we are currently at 93% with 87% of those being responsive in less than 60 seconds. so we got more work. do you think additional resources will be helpful in getting to 100% or do you still argue that less resources are necessary to get from 93 to 100? no, i just think we have to work on how fast our actual infrastructure process sees these things. on to a question about resources. the fbis core mission is to counter terrorism, espionage, and major criminal threats. a recent large-scale reassignments to immigration enforcement or politically motivated investigations caused me concerns that other critical missions are being neglected. one example, in march of this year, you created a tesla-related task force and diverted personnel from the domestic terrorism operations section to work on that task force. what risk analysis justified that decision and do you still consider domestic violent terrorism to be a lower priority? any form of terrorism domestic or national is the highest priority at the fbi. the white and red resources away from those missions. i do not believe that is accurate. we did not divert resources away when cars were exploding and people were being set on fire. i directed resources to address it. i will suggest in your follow-up and we can make this more explicit on questions for the record that you provide the accurate information about the diversion of resources because again when i understand that you authorize large-scale agent reassignments from counterintelligence and cybercrime to not just immigration cases but others. it has an impact on other priorities like nation-state threats and ransomware investigations. moving on to a different subject area. safeguarding our elections is a core fbi responsibility. the public needs confidence that election security work is driven by facts and free from political influence. mr. director, do you agree with attorney general bondy's decision to disband the fbi foreign influence task force? the disbanding of that task force did not in any way reallocate or take away resources from that critical mission set. so then how are you mitigating the risk of foreign actors interfering in u.s. elections heading in? as i have highlighted through our cyber programs which have seen a 40-50-60% increase in arrests for cyber threat actors looking to not just harm our critical infrastructure systems but also interfere in our elections. we have had multiple arrests this year as individuals who are interfering in that process. data that department of justice is election-integred task force seek statewide voter lists and driver's license data. i cannot speak for the department of justice. you remember the department of justice? i can speak. i play a role in those requests. whatever request that we had pursuant to departments direction were provided. so then you can speak for the fbi for the fbi. so you can speak to those actions for the fbi. so what role did you play in those requests? whatever request we get from the department, i do not have those details in front of me. we provide whatever requests they have. i have not many details in front of you and a lot of the questions come from this side of the aisle. so i do hope that there are substantive and accurate responses to our questions in writing. in my time, left, mr. chairman, i just want to call out a couple of observations. the director before us has tried to explain. i will not say explain, tried to explain how. he does not need another $500 million to do the job. and specifically that even if the fbi had an additional $500 million, it would take years. i think he referenced 14 years to fill the vacancies. but in the meantime, we are relying on partnership with local law enforcement to fulfill the mission of the bureau. as we have discussed in other hearings and in other committees, by the way, given this immigration and for a mass deportation agenda of the administration, the fbi is not the only one leaning on local law enforcement to do the job. ice has made it clear that they are doing the same other law enforcement agencies within dhs is doing the same. so much so that ice's recruitment, because they are not only not advocating for cuts or actually requesting additional dollars and have issues of a policy with them. but if ice's plan to do the job is not just hiring up significantly, they do not seem to have that as a concern, but the fbi does. both ice and the fbi are citing partnerships with local law enforcement, which like partnership and engagement is great. but having come from local law enforcement at the outset of my public service career, i also know that capacity and resources at the local level are strained, particularly in times like this. so when ice is going on a hiring spree and have local law enforcement agencies worried about their ability to recruit and retain local law enforcement officers and not losing them to the federal government, then our reliance on those local law enforcement agencies is a perilous strategy to take and could undermine local law enforcement's ability to address crime at the local level, whether it is white collar crime, organized retail theft, violent crime, etc, etc, etc. and in my final minute, i will also suggest this. director patel has referenced earlier in the hearing that one of the most significant value add-ins of partnering with local law enforcement is that they have the best intelligent, they are the best intelligent source. is that correct? for on the ground. and yet when local law enforcement is put in a perilous position of being in a role with this mass deportation agenda, which is consistently overreached, has been found to violate the law and the constitution and has undermined public confidence and law enforcement, not just by immigrants, by the way, but especially immigrants. when immigrants are victims of crime and are afraid to come forward because they do not know what law enforcement is going to do with their information or not, when immigrants, legal or undocumented are witnesses to crime and are afraid to come forward with that information because they do not know what is going to happen with their information or not, that undermines the credibility of law enforcement with community and undermines the intelligence director patel that you say are the best source of intelligence when it comes to law enforcement. so it is shaky, it is worrisome and in my opinion overall you are failing to live up to the role and responsibility that you have been confirmed to and i associate with myself with everything senator booker said earlier. thank you, mr. chairman. okay, before we go to senator blackburn without objection, i am going to introduce you to the record recently, declassified document thanks to director patel. the document is a director ray fbi analysis of nelly oars false statements to the congress or never suffered consequences for advancing the only trump russia narrative and attempting to cover up her involvement in the hoax with false statements. yet, timing again, the american justice system has been weaponized against president trump and his associates such as peter navarro with reckless abandon. the doj's inaction on nelly oars criminal referral despite the obvious incriminate evidence provided in the fbi's own analysis undermines public trust and the rule of law. thanks, the director raised utter failure senator blackburn. thank you, mr. chairman and director patel. thank you ever so much for being with us today and i want to thank you for your commitment to fight violent crime in memphis and when you first came to meet with me before you are hearing here, i gave you the stats on memphis tennessee and their crime rates and then you committed then and again at your confirmation to help us. you have been true to your word and we are very, very grateful. operation viper has been such a success. the 500 arrests are important. these are gang members and gang leaders out of memphis tennessee. there are over 100 gangs in memphis. so the impact of these arrests, the impact of 100 indictments of these gang members and now we have a us attorney's office that will actually prosecute violent crimes and actually take up and prosecute federal gun crimes. this is helping to make memphis safe again and yesterday at the white house to have the president announce the second phase of this with bringing in the guard and we have got atf and dea and the us marshals and homeland security and the work that you and general bondi and the president have done is so appreciated by the people of memphis shelby county, west tennessee, and i am ever so grateful for the work you have done. you know one of the things as we talk about memphis and what a vibrant and wonderful historic city it is, it is important to realize memphis is one of the logistics hubs in our country. you have i-40 which goes east coast to west coast. you have the port of memphis. you have fedex. you have all five class a railroads that are there as well as so many companies that are important to memphis and i have found it so interesting that some of my colleagues want to complain about agents being taken out of the dc office and actually put to work in the field because they have been needed in the field and you can look at the stats from operation viper and see the difference that they have made and we so appreciate that. i do want to drill down just a little bit on the issue of cargo theft which ties into the logistics hub and memphis. we have got a lot of companies that go through their i-m-c as a big logistics company. people in memphis know what it takes to keep america moving but what a lot of people may not realize is that many of these criminal gangs have been focused on cargo theft. this is how they pay for their activities. so in addition to the car jackings and the home robberies and the smashing grabs and some of the human insects trafficking they have gotten into cargo theft and cargo theft in memphis has increased over 5,000 percent. that is what you saw with a biden administration who would not drill down on this. so having these agents out in the field, having an interagency approach is something that is going to help us with getting our hands around this cargo theft. so talk for just a minute about what your team has done there and the importance of having that interagency approach. absolutely senator. so operation viper nest under operations summer heat and in multiple cities and mid-major cities across the country we have surging resources based on crime. and memphis as you know senator had the highest per capita homicide in the rate in the country and that was simply unacceptable. and so what we did was what we call phase 0 one of operations at the president's direction. we went into some of these cities quietly to collect the intelligence that was necessary to start these operations to start seizing these firearms which we see as i think over 115 firearms off the street to start taking narcotics off the streets and also to infiltrate the gang network, the criminal street gang network that is providing these guns and drugs to the public and these communities allowing for these shootings. and so what the fbi is good at what the fbi is great at is partnering with our local authorities in places like memphis and miami in chicago and miss so many other cities across the country to start the work because you cannot do the work on a dartboard basis you need ground level intelligence and that is what we do working with our state and local law enforcement and the results i think they said over 100 indictments federally just in this three four months surge and now we are going to go in there with more resources to finish it. and we are grateful for that and i think it is so important for my colleagues what we have seen in memphis you mentioned something very important your agents go in and they go in quietly. there was there was no press conference there was no fanfare you went in there to work and very importantly you gathered the intel who are these gang leaders where are they figuring out who was doing what and then setting up the process to apprehend these these individuals and it requires infiltrating those networks and having that data to work from so that you are working in partnership and as i have talked with elected leaders in shelby county and memphis as we have talked with those in law enforcement they have been so grateful to have this support and this additional education that comes because local police are learning from your agents when they are learning how to track these gangs and infiltrate these networks we know that phase two of this operation is going to kick off the guard is going to be there to support the memphis police department to help them kind of catch up because they still have a lot of people on their board they know who they are where they are what they are doing they want to apprehend them and bring them forward so talk a little bit about how phase two is going to continue to work to support the law enforcement efforts in memphis. well it is just like what happened here in washington dc it takes a whole of government interagency approach where we are working with the attorney general the dea the atf the us marshals department homeland security because each one of those agencies has specialized capabilities and when we surge together to work off of the ground level intelligence was collected you see what happened in washington dc here and that is the next phase of it because you are able to utilize the national guard to set up border perimeter operations so when you go into an area you have the secure workspace to get in there and stay in there the key here senator is sustained criminal investigations and sustained prosecutions that clear memphis like we did washington permanently and leave behind a blueprint for what local law enforcement can do with our federal partners to sustain that we do not want to go backwards and that is critical but we are in the next step sustaining it will be the last one. well and we certainly appreciate that i do want to touch on operation restored justice and senator britt mentioned some of this very briefly and i know that you and ajie bondi have done a tremendous amount of work in protecting children i appreciate that and we passed my report act last year and the president president biden signed it and this does require social media to report to nick mick so that they we can have these perpetrators followed up with an apprehended that is a good start we are still trying to get the kids online safety act passed that has been a bipartisan effort we have looked with disdain at what has happened with discord and charlie kirk's killer alleged killer talk for a moment about what else congress ought to do in order to give you all the toolbox you need to apprehend these predators and pedophiles well i think we need to go after the monetary backbone of this infrastructure like we discussed earlier i think we also need to make parents across the country aware of how invasive some of these social media sites are and how much criminal enterprise is going on and how easily these kids can be sucked into it and also the only way in my opinion to do that is a senator cloboture and i believe senator graham had stated was you know we need to work on section 230 it is just to it is been too long since we have addressed it nobody's being held accountable they are making money and our youth is dying and that is just unacceptable. well we have that reform bill thank you mr chairman thank you senator welch thank you very much mr chairman and just at the outset i just want to say what i think all of us believe and that is that the political violence that is so afflicting our country it does not matter whether it is from the right or the left i mean all of us have an obligation to fiercely advocate for our point of view all of us have an obligation to respect people with whom we disagree the folks we disagree with are our opponents but they are not our enemies and i i hope all of us keep that in mind and do the best we can to set that example i want to congratulate the fbi i want to congratulate of the utah state and local law enforcement for the very good work that it did in apprehending the violent assailant of charlie kirk and that is a terrible terrible tragedy of director patel at one point you made an announcement that the suspect was in custody we got our man it turned out that was not true in fact i think that was about 27 hours before the person now in custody was apprehended why did you make that statement thank you senator appreciate you letting me address this um what the fbi does is not just locate and find suspects suspects but we also participate in eliminating subjects and what we had at the time was a subject in custody in relation to this investigation so in my commitment to work with the public to help identify subjects and suspects i put that information out and then when we interviewed him i put out the results of that and could i have been more careful in my verbiage and included an a subject instead of subject sure in the heat of the moment but i was doing the best i cannot no candor i do not quite get that because if we have our man that would suggest that the public that everybody can rest and relax and not then continue to provide information to the local law enforcement and to you so that was a mistake i do not see it as a mistake i see it as something working with the public to identify that there was a subject so if you put out if you put out a statement this says we have got our man in fact it turns out that you did not have your man that is not a mistake but that is not what i said i will go on that is my understanding a second thing that is really important in the fbi but it is important in every agency is that the folks who are doing good work get supported for the work they are doing and a number of highly successful fbi agents have been let go and i want to just ask you a little bit about that you know who brian driscoll is right yes yeah okay and my understanding is he served at the fbi for over 18 years you agree i believe that is accurate special agent in charge of the newark office he was commander of the fbi's hostage rescue team that is a very prestigious and responsible position it is a section chief of the critical incident response groups tactical section you have got to be pretty pretty good to get that high responsibility you you agree with that yes sir he oversaw 55 swat teams and they are like the elite of the elite right they they they they go in to the dangerous situations right he got a medal of valor for his participation in a raid on isis terrorist abu sayaf who had kidnapped american citizens kyla mueller right mueller is that right i know you are you are an agreement right i know kyla mueller family yes i know this okay and he got the kurt meyer somebody who had barricaded himself after in a bar after he killed four people and wounded two and driscoll was part of the team that went in there and took that guy out right i do not have all the details but i will take your word for it center and he got into trouble when acting when email bove demanded a list of fbi agents who investigated january 6 and was apprehensive that what did happen ultimately would happen and that is those folks would get fired i mean do you agree with me that a boss who stands up for his subordinates when they did the job that was asked of them is a stand-up person and somebody to be admired generally speaking yes sir pardon me generally speaking yes sir but driscoll got fired right again that matters under litigation and the matter you referenced occurred before i was right there let us just keep it purely narrow here he is fired right yes he was terminated and he has to be there somebody communicates to him that he is terminated correct that is my job that is your job so you communicated to him that he was fired i did so you know i have a hard time with this because that records suggest to me that this person is like worthy of consideration for the presidential medal of freedom and he got fired but there is also a record of other information that was available and now that this matters pending litigation we will get that out and do course but as you so you can so call so you have got quote other information that you see as a valid basis to fire somebody who from what i can tell had an absolutely outstanding record and who crossed the threshold of getting in trouble because he was standing up for agents serving under him who did work that was assigned to them that happened to be related to the january 6th uprising again you are correlating based on your information the reasons for his termination and i am telling this right let me ask another question you know when you were here you were rightly critical not here actually i guess it was on cash's corner you were rightly critical of the way that the previous fbi director used the the fbi jet and you said you wanted a ground crisp raised private jet travel that he pays for with taxpayer dollars to hop around the country let me ask you this you know on the weekend of according to flight tracker data on the weekend of march 7th an fbi plane flew around trip from dc to las vegas and you attended a ufc flight with mill gibson and i will show you that is that you and is that true yeah you want to do the difference i live in las vegas i am allowed to go home i did not leave a congressional hearing early on an fbi jet to dodge questions all right then on april 5th you attended a hockey game in new york city you do not live there right no i do not by the way every day fbi agents who are signed in washington do not get to fly home on a private jet well this is a great point do you know why i have to use a private jet because congress made it mandatory okay in the april 5th well we did not make an inventory that you got a ufc games with mill to get you telling me i cannot go home you know you got to use some judgment here so when i am at home i cannot do what i am doing when i go home everybody else is allowed to go home to me no i am glad you go home i love to go home but i do not go home on a private jet on april 5th you are not mandated to do so you attended a hockey game in new york city with wayne graski and flight tracker says the fbi jet took you to and from new york city where you do not live right that is correct and on april 12th on the following weekend you attended a ufc flight a fight in miami also on the fbi jet right that is correct so what is the cost to the taxpayer for those three flights but i pay the commercial equivalent per the law and so just so you know when you are comparing me to prior directors i asked what the cost was and you do not know i take it yeah and what i have done with the with the use of the private jet is use andrew's air force base versus reagan national as what the other directors have done to say the taxpayer dollars here you flew home to the las vegas there is nobody else in the fbi who gets paid they do not they have to pay their own way if they want to go home right i mean one of the right well that is not accurate depending on where your station the fbi covers the bill to get home so are you telling me that fbi agents who are signed in washington but who may live in charlotte they get paid by the fbi sometimes they do yes right another thing i want to say is this you know our local law enforcement has been stiffed about five hundred million dollars in cop grants have been taken out of the budget those really help us in burlington they help us in rutland they really are important and why in the world would we be cutting those cop grants when we need that local law enforcement in part to partner with you well i think you support that i think you are speaking to the department of justice grants which i do not adjudicate but also vermont just like every other state has received a plus-up of fbi personnel well tell you that is not what we are seeing yeah i think my understanding is that there is a requisition or an effort to get another plane for the fbi that would cost about seventy two million dollars is that right that is that is inaccurate the fbi because the jet as you call it is not my jet we use it for operational needs we use it for f-tox we use it for hrt that is the one you you fly in right we have multiple fixed wing assets and one of them is on a wildly expensive lease that i deemed a waste of money and i am looking for a replacement in which the government can procure assets permanently well but i would welcome you submitting to this committee the cost information about the jets that are under consideration and according to our research the specifications that are included in this request would result in an expenditure of between seventy two million in eighty million dollars that is inaccurate but i will probably get to the right numbers i welcome getting this specific information that is thank you mr. chairman i yield back it is on but i will get i can get closer uh komi became fbi director 2013 and then something like when i became ranking member in the middle of a congress uh or i was ranking member komi needed an excuse to come to demoin iowa some place in iowa for a family reunion he wanted to meet with me in waterloo iowa i think nothing more than an excuse to say he did something official on that trip now i cannot accuse him of that because i do not know but i cannot recall that we we discussed anything very serious that had to be meet meet him and waterloo or cedar happens at the airport before he went to the union and then two or three years ago ray was sitting where you were and we had two republicans one that have second round of questioning and it would have taken about ten minutes and he refused to because he got on this airplane that you are talking about going to the adirondacks thank you so i find interesting that my democratic colleagues cannot seem to bring up about your use of the justice department planes yet my democratic colleagues did not seem to interested about my oversight of raise use of the plane i did not hear a beep so my democratic colleagues need to be consistent and i just add mr. chairman that when you compare the flight logs and the percentage of work travel the personal travel for the prior two fbi directors over a third of their travel was personal on those same jets that i am being accused of improperly utilizing my mark is far less than that also both of those directors used dollar is used reagan national airport which has landing fees of five to ten thousand dollars because they did not want to drive 25 minutes to andrews we take off and land in andrews every single time because it is cheaper and we do so because it saves a taxpayer dollars those are the things we are doing to make sure that we are good stewards of taxpayer dollars and also any new acquisition of an airline or fixed wing asset for the fbi will specifically need the needs of the demands of the foreign f-talk operations and hostage rescue operations in our critical infrastructure programs senator moody thank you chairman appreciate you are very patient i am i am very patient you are very patient i am new here to the senate and i watch what you have to to go through as chairman and we thank you a lot of what we are talking about today and you have been questioned about was uncovered because of our chairman and his service to this committee and i want to thank him because he is uncovered a lot especially during the last administration where many of our federal agencies went far off their mission and i believe we would not have as much information as we do if it was not for our esteemed chairman so i wanted to publicly thank him and being the newest member of judiciary i am so grateful to be here because sometimes i am wondering if some of my colleagues on the other side of the idol do not know what they are talking about or if they are ill intentioned and purposefully trying to gaslight not just the american public but other people in law enforcement and agencies that that you are working with so as a former attorney general as a former federal prosecutor as a former judge as the wife of a law enforcement officer both federal and state over the course of his career i would like to clarify a few things and give you the opportunity to highlight some of the things that the fbi is doing and two of the things i heard thrown out there and by the way it was when some some of my colleagues would breeze in just in time to rail on you and spout out misinformation and narratives that have no grounding in reality into criminal justice and then breeze right out as soon as they were done and i think that it does the american public more good when the oversight function of congress allows for you to comment in a way that makes sense and is grounded in reality so let us first talk about the reason why we are having to reassign not just in the fbi but another agencies criminal justice agencies federal agents to accomplish different things as has been done historically throughout our country when we get into office we have to examine and triage the threats facing this nation threats facing americans and then allocate resources accordingly i guess you are to be judged negatively because you are trying to reallocate the resources of the fbi to fix what the democratic administration prior to this under biden broke so let us talk about the reassignment of federal agents and why that has been necessary would you say that the majority of assignments has been made because we are facing unprecedented levels of violence both because of the unvetted surge of anywhere from 11 million to 20 million people across our border in the last four years and because of the woke weak insane policies that have been pushed into states and cities around this nation by the left absolutely and so i hear you being grilled because you have rightfully pushed resources where they needed to go to to protect the american public and i have heard you questioned that you are in some way and i am going to use their words which i do not believe is grounded in reality that you are going to lean on local and state agents to do the job of the fbi might it be recharacterized more accurately in that you are partnering with local and state agencies in these areas especially where these policies that the democrats support wholeheartedly in fact they frustrate our efforts to try and beef up our laws with good criminal justice policies at every turn and then come in here and get on you for by the way you have been here seven months so i know that in the seven months you did not break it they broke it over the last four years but it is a more accurate to say that you are using the federal government and its agencies or its agents and its resources to supplement and amplify law enforcement efforts in these areas cities and states where the democrat policies broke them we are it is been an integral part of my tenure to use local and state partnerships i say everywhere i go we cannot do the work without partnering with state local authorities in every single state and every single county in this country and why we pushed out to the field is simple mathematics while the fbi had a bloated bureaucracy in washington dc nearly one-third of the fbi's workforce lived and worked in the national capital region one-third of the crime does not happen here so i made this simple decision to move them out to move them out where the crime was happening in the field to move out field agents to move out intel analysts to move out program managers and by the way that is what they all want to do go out in the field and do the work and no one's going to be punished for going out in the field and doing the work and no one's going to be punished for wanting to stay at headquarters and help but we needed a reallocation of assets and that is what we did and from your experience both before and now in office have you found that many of these non-profits have done work to undermine the stability and security of cities those matters are very much ongoing and hopefully we can report the results soon and i do not mean just those that may have aided in a bedded or supported criminal acts those absolutely should be investigated and pursued full six ten of the law and i hope that we follow the money trail as some of my colleagues have suggested i also want to get your opinion about the non-profits that are working to push get elected and then push criminal justice policies that have made our cities and states less safe specifically i am going to push out all of the things that they espouse make the cities stronger no cash bail try not to charge crimes do not call people offenders or felons or rapists or drug traffickers i can go on and on and on but the gist is do not charge when you do charge charges minimally as you can do not put people on parole or probation following incarceration diversion should be the rule i mean i can go on and on and we are seeing these play out in cities across our nation i am one who believes it is always important to look at how we can do things better in our criminal justice system but what has happened is some of these groups have hijacked that good intention by so many and used it as a way to subvert the stability of this country and i firmly believe when that money is traced you are going to find it is not only going not just to policies but it is also going to pushing and promoting criminal acts and i believe that money and support does not just come from infrastructure within the u.s. because i believe undermining our cities and this nation is something our foreign adversaries will get behind and it will show that they are behind is the fbi trying in its reallocation of resources to make up and help in these areas where local law enforcement is trying its best but it is fighting an uphill battle against mayors and city council and indeed governors that promote and support and pass laws and policies that follow these weak insane policies we go into every community where the crime rates are high and if you look across the board the crime rates are coming down across the country because the fbi is going in there and doing good police work and we are not going to be dictated to by mayors or governors we have federal law enforcement capabilities and responsibilities to our citizenry and we are executing those on every single day including rural communities and tribal lands and you are correct me if i am wrong welcome and supported and enthusiastically praise by the cops that are there because they want those communities safer well i think the police speak for themselves and we will let them do that at their own leisure and and one of the other gas lightings that i heard was that at a time when we are trying to help them because they are having vacancy rates and they cannot retain police and you are causing that is it in fact that police across this country because they have been defunded they are not supported they have groups that are continuously combating when they are trying to make the community safer i know this because when i was the attorney general they all wanted to come to florida and i welcomed them with open arms in fact we are increasing our ranks in florida sometimes to the detriment of other cities and states because they cannot keep them they tried to make it sound like it was your fault that we had vacancies in these police ranks around the niche when in fact are not you trying to help bolster their ranks and help them because they have mayors and prosecutors and city councils and governors that will not help them that is exactly what we did we did it in dc we are doing it in memphis we are going to chicago miami st. louis so many other cities across the country and i am just grateful that you are doing this and i commend you for all the numbers that i am seeing uh going after the violent crime helping make sure we are getting the the criminals that came here unvetted from other nations out of this country that you are allocating resources to those efforts it is all important to make this a stronger safe for nation and we appreciate you being here today and making sure we are talking truth and not misinformation to the american people thank you thank you senator shif i want to you see to introduce into the record a declassified clinton annex the clinton annex is a declassified appendix to the justice department inspector general report about the clinton email investigation the annex shows that the fbi had evidence necessary to conduct quote thorough and complete investigation and a quote but the komey fbi failed to review the evidence at the time after nearly a decade in the shadows this information is now come to light thanks to dr. patel or director patel senator shif thank you mr. chairman mr. patel during your confirmation hearing you made several important commitments for instance you told senator coons there will be no politicization at the fbi there'll be no retributive actions taken by any fbi should i be confirmed as fbi director so let me ask you very specifically did you ever take any action to terminate or discipline an fbi agent or employee in whole or in part as a retribution for being part of an investigation of donald trump or january 6th now you also committed you assured senator blooming thaw all fbi employees will be protected protected against political retribution so you are testifying today that you played no role in the firing of even a single fbi agent for political retribution none for political retribution and if any fbi agent said you did they would be lying is that your testimony i am only speaking to my actions everybody is allowed to make their allegations and these are allegations against you and i am sorry to tell if if fbi senior fbi agents or employees said that you were firing them for political retribution reasons because of the cases they were assigned you are saying they would be lying is anyone that was terminated at the fbi was done so for failing to meet the standards uphold their constitutional oath and effectuate the mission well by meet the standards are you talking about meet the standards of protecting the president under any circumstance no you also guaranteed senator bloomethal that every fbi employee will be held to the same absolute same standard no one will be terminated for case assignments are you testifying today that you never terminated anyone at the fbi in whole or in part because of a prior case assignment no one at the fbi is terminated for case assignments along well i am asking about you mr. patel did you in whole or in part terminate anyone at the fbi because they worked on the trump investigation or because they worked on january six no one at the fbi has been terminated for case assignments alone okay you are saying alone does that mean they were terminated in part because they were assigned to a january six case or assigned to the mario lago case you are being very precise here mr. patel you are saying alone that means they were fired in part because they were assigned those cases is that your testimony absolutely not but if you want to keep it more well then let me ask you let us strip away the word alone did you terminate or participate in any discipline of any fbi employee in whole or in part because of their work on an investigation of donald trump or january six yes or no any terminations at the fbi by employees on a very specific and i am going to answer the question but you do not like the answer because it is no i and it cuts one answer one question i do not want to answer someone else's question so let me just be precise and i ask for a yes or no answer did you ever terminate or discipline an fbi employee in whole or in part because they had been assigned or worked on an investigation of donald trump or january six yes or no employees are only terminated yes or no i am told they are oaths of yes or no you are not answering my question i do not have to answer my question yes or no because you are setting up a trap so you can have a meeting in our team i am not giving it to you unless it is true that you fired people people have been terminated at the fbi who failed to uphold the assigned to the fbi requires did you tell did you tell anyone at the fbi that all fbi employees who they identified who had worked on cases against president trump would be removed from their jobs did you tell that to someone at the fbi say that that would remove people for case assignments that you would that people that were identified as having worked on cases against president trump would be removed from their jobs did you tell that to someone at the fbi people are not removed just answer my question just answer my question did you tell that to someone are not removed for case assignments and i would never tell anyone did you tell some of the fbi that fbi employees identified as having worked on cases against president trump would be removed from their jobs yes or no did you tell someone that i would never tell anyone at the fbi that they are being removed for basically their case assignments okay so anyone who said that would be lying is that your testimony anyone can say whatever they want no i know but you are saying there were a liar i am telling you what i said because this is in the complaint against you mr. patel so you are saying mr. driscoll and others are liars i am not going to address the complaint in the ongoing issue have you ever told anyone at the fbi that the fbi tried to put the president in jail and he has not forgotten and that your job depended on the removal of agents who worked on cases against the president no did you ever tell anyone that no okay did you ever tell anyone that you knew these summary firings you were undertaking were illegal likely illegal and that you would be sued and later deposed you ever tell anyone that no firings at the fbi or trevidations were done for anything other than justified you ever telling one that mr. no tell what your termations at the fbi were ever done in my tenure for anything other than failed you ever telling one of that mr. patel he will answer the question the fbi i guess you have one answer question so let me move on let me move on to the epstein files you said you are the most transparent fbi director in history so i am going to put you to the test in 2024 you were asked by glenn beck about epstein's black book and you said he asked who has jeffrey epstein's black book and you said black book fbi and he said but who that is i mean theirs and you said oh that is under the direct control of the director of the fbi that is what you said was that true mr. patel i will rely on you quoting it accurately i think that was a two years ago what you what you represented to mr. beck in the president supporters out there or were you lying were you was it true that the black book epstein's black book was on was in the possession of the fbi director the black book was not the possession of the fbi okay so now that you are the fbi director you have possession of the black book right that index has been released so you have jeffrey epstein's black book what is known as jeffrey epstein's black book has been released okay and you released and let me fall up on senator kennedy's question because he asked you and i will be very precise here you have seen most of the files who if anyone did epstein traffic these young women two besides himself and you said himself there is no credible information none if they are where i would bring the case yesterday that he traffic to other individuals and kennedy that the information we have again is limited and senator kennedy said the answer is no one and you said for the information we have so is it your testimony today that in all the epstein files that jeffrey epstein trafficked no one to anyone but himself is that your test testimony mr. jeffrey epstein did traffic anyone else did he traffic any any young woman to someone other than himself that was mr. kennedy's questions and i said the information that three administrations have an access to i have made determinations that there are no investigative leads that were credible to prosecute and investigate any others i am specifically stating whether you were checking out today you just read it and i said it 10 minutes ago so i will let the record reflect my testimony i just want to make sure there is no misunderstanding because there are victims like virginia weifer who have testified otherwise who have said otherwise and you are telling the american people today that the epstein list is a single name and it is jeffrey epstein that is what we are to believe that is not what i am saying that is what you are saying and you can say whatever let me ask you this uh when todd blanche went to interview juzanne maxwell she said but did i like think these guys were coming for that i really do not if you met epstein there is no way that this cast of characters of which it is extraordinary and some are in your cabinet who you value as your co-workers and you know would be with him if he was a creeper because they wanted sexual favors a man wants sexual favors he will find out they did not have to come to epstein for that and the next question todd blanche the president's former criminal defense lawyer asked is not who in the cabinet who you are referring to is question is so when is the last time you think you were with mr. epstein when he got a massage so let me ask you who are those cabinet members that juzanne maxwell julane maxwell is referring to that uh that were part of this cast of characters associated with mr. epstein who are they? the deputy attorney general took the aggressive step that no one else did an interview miss maxwell for two days and we released the entirety of that transcript i do not have that transcript in front of me you are picking at peace meal the american public and read the entirety of that one last question because you clearly will not tell us the cabinet members associated with mr. epstein let me ask you one last question and that is right after she gives this testimony front of an fbi agent among others she is transferred to a minimum security prison not suitable for a sex offender like herself who made that decision and why the bureau of prisons the bureau decisions made it in prisons the bureau prisons decided on their own without any consultation with blanch or anyone else that they were gonna suddenly after this interview completely unrelated to this interview completely unrelated to anything she said move her to a prison not suitable for a sex offender you want the american people to believe that do you think they are stupid? no i think the american people believe the truth that i am not in the weeds on the everyday movements it made what i am doing is protecting this country providing historic reform and combating the weaponization of intelligence by the likes of you and we have tell usly proven you to be a liar in russia game in january 6 you are the biggest fraud to ever sit in the united states senate disgrace to this system and an utter coward i am not surprised i am not surprised to continue to lie from your perch and put on a show so you can go raise money for your charade you are political buffoon at best well you can take an in a troll take it to the bank that the fbi is protecting this country control the state and citizens of the california will all year for a historic reform internet order but all you care about is a child sex predator that was prosecuted by a prior administration and the obama justice department and the biden justice department did squat and what did president trump do bring new charges courageously and what have we done term and take control of the transfer and fbi director in history 33,000 pages of information to you i challenge you to say anything credibly to the truth go ahead and run to the cameras where you want to go now it will be a big quiet before i go to senator tell us without objection i want to introduce into the record the durham annex the durham annex is a declassified appendix to john durham's report about crossfire hurricane the durham annex contains information exposing a reported clinton campaign plan to falsify president to falsely tie president trump to russia for years i fought to assemble and publicize all the facts here to for unknown surrounding durham's investigation crossfire hurricane and related matters the durham annex was declassified large part because of director patel senator tell us thank you mr. chairman and director patel thank you for being here i uh i have actually admired the way you have tried to uh keep your composure over the course of this kind of reminds me of an old foresight comic uh that said the flogging will continue until maral improves uh last one i just coach on do not take the bait because they are going to use that discussion between you and senator shuff as you have suggested before to raise money just sit down in the quiet confidence that you are doing a good job real quick in less than 30 seconds give me your resume again on why you are qualified for this position uh thank you senator served as a public defender national security prosecutor i tried over 60 criminal trials to verdict in state and federal court i served as the lead investigator in the house intelligence committee and the counterterrorism expert there um unfolding the russia gate investigation i served as the head of counterterrorism for a presidential white house i served as a deputy director of national intelligence at the office director of national intelligence overseeing our 17 intelligence agencies i served as a chief of staff to the department of defense and the secretary of defense overseeing two trillion dollar uh financial equity flow and also defending the homeland and providing for a no-fail mission we could drive i drilled down in details because i have studied that record and i think you should be very proud of it i just did that for the benefit of the liberal media that just keep referring to you as a uh podcaster i think and i appreciate you giving me that resume uh is a good body of work it is why i supported your nomination so strongly when you report this committee um really quickly too on the events of last week and the the sad death and assassination of mr. kirk i i seem to recall that mr. zen i think was the first person of interest he was reported to be saying us shot him now shoot me or something to that effect um would that have more allowed and your job is to calm the the tensions right there were people running all over the building people are right over there uh could it be that because you were in possession of some of that information that maybe you did just characterize as getting our man um that that maybe that is what led up to it if those facts are correct the what led me to that is to the eliminate subjects but also we were in a period with inside of 24 hours where we did not know who the shooter was well that that is why i asked because people are forgetting that this man was reported to have been saying i shot him now shoot me they are also forgetting that he brought in an attorney and said that he fabricated the claim to draw attention away from the actual shooter and he went on to get multiple charges for possessing child pornography and sexual abuse material on his phone so i am just saying that that it just seems to me that in the moment maybe you should have used different words but i cannot imagine that the the amount of time that we have spent on that on that subject in the hearing today but i think it is because they are really worried that there are another punchline to an old joke um your work it is working in practice but it is not working in their theory they have not heard you so it is working in practice but not in theory they have not heard you say multiple times that you have clustered up fbi resources at every state they have not heard you when you have talked about year over year comparisons for results i do not care how many people you have at hq as long as you keep producing those results and they are good they need to be sustained now i am a little bit concerned about the deployment of national guard troops to dangerous cities but you keep on you keep on mentioning something i am going to go back to in terms of joint task forces you also did a great job of explaining why you think you should save money and go out and fly out of an airport versus an easy trip across the potomac to national i love all those responses i am not going to repeat them here but i am i am worried that if if we move in too quickly let us say to memphis i would i should back up and say i would speak to the house in north carolina um and i would consider it a personal failure on the part of state leadership if they have to call in federal resources to do their job beyond what they do every day and that is promoting joint task forces i have seen eight at f d e a f b i i have been in the briefing rooms at three of the clock in the morning about to go and do a 55 no knock warrants on bad people you all do that every day and thank god that you are it looks like we should plus it up in a few cities i would rather use the money to deploy national guard to just continue to leverage what you are already doing well and i compliment you because i have got to believe it is a lot of these joint task forces that have increased the apprehension and charging rates so thank you for that but do you agree that at the end of the day if we are going to have a sustained impact on crime whether it is memphis or any other city that we have really got to enable and power and continue to support the men and women on the ground there every single day hundred percent thank you i think that your cost benefit mine needs to go into if i am about to deploy this many national guardsman to a to a city what is that cost and what would that look like if we were plowing that cost of deployment into ongoing i believe joint task force which are working very well they are working well north carolina so i would like you to look at it now i am going to move on the safer communities act can i get your commitment to get an update maybe we could even take a trip out to west virginia to see how we are doing an extraordinary job of mixed background checks people are getting them in record time but we are taking a few guns away from people that probably should not be able to buy that day would you agree in that characterization i would love to have you out and anyone else in this day is the west virginia see the i would like to bring some of our colleagues to see it is working we had people on my side of the aisle saying it was going to be awful it was going to result in mass confiscation of guns not true they were wrong this bill is making a difference i also want to talk about the behavioral health and other components and granting i know in north carolina things are going well i want to make sure that flows going out there because the tragic events in north carolina and charlotte the stabbing i spoke with one of the family members yesterday are i i i think that we have to recognize that we have magistrates that have a revolving door policy no doubt about that and they should be held accountable if they are releasing dangerous people but also think that some of the problem is that we simply do not have a place to send people particularly with respect to behavioral health we have got to continue to write every law enforcement officer i have ever spoken with says look i have got law enforcement officers to conduct to an emergency room because i have got somebody with no place to send them i do not have a bed upstairs i can send them to i do not have a behavioral health facility we have got to provide more ways to detain people that are a risk to themselves and a risk for the community and i really do believe safer communities act as a good framework for doing that that is only a comment section 702 is going to come up in april of next year for renewal do you believe it should be eliminated and not reauthorized no sir can i also get your commitment maybe to come back over and review some of the controls that are in place and other things so hopefully we will not have the drama leading up to april we can actually come here and get consensus on why you have got the checks and balances in place and why we should do it just remove any chance that we are going to run into that that cliff narrative next year can i get your commitment on to have it still thank you i want to talk very briefly on and the chairman's give me a gabble but i promise not to go over more than two minutes but that is why i chose to be last so i could have this discussion and actually get to some facts versus agendas and clip bait click bait that we are almost certainly see going forward tell me a little bit about the rationale behind the the change in stance and recruiting i also understand there may be a a reduction in the academy timeline just give me some thinking about where you are on recruiting retention training etc so recruitment is through the roof we doubled up month over month our applicants to be 18 11s are federal agents until analyst so the recruitment is going wonderful what we have to do is figure out a way to get creative because the bftc timeline is an 18 to 20 week program and what we have done to address the openings we have for 18 11 brick agents is we open it up to the other agents and say hey do you have secret service or de a or at f want to come over you guys went through fletsey you guys were cops or military officers your law enforcement so we created a shortened bridge program of six weeks at quanaco that if you want to come over and be an fb i agent you can do so there is transfers all the time we just made it easier and we are also recruiting police officers who might not have a college degree but in my opinion that does not disqualify them from serving our communities so we are welcoming them it is a rigorous application process it is just one item but we are changing the timelines based on the needs of the country but not jeopardizing quality i am glad you uh you mentioned that i heard someone almost a throwaway line that you were hiring people without a college degree i uh i most of them had have had basic law enforcement training all the kinds of certifications you are talking to somebody who did not achieve my four year degree until i was 37 i would like to think that i brought some things to the table and i think that those people the the comment the beer comment i think is an inappropriate for somebody considering this to think that they are a lesser person because they do not have a piece of paper um i um i wanted to get back to the the last thing uh that i will talk about i will follow up with some questions for the record thank you incidentally for consistently being responsive to any any increase i have made to you um but on the the clerk shooting um i do believe that uh that senator schmitt's numbers are right there seems to be a disproportionate number of voices on the left that are celebrating the assassination of a ceo or celebrating the assassination of someone in mr. kirk's case that i disagreed with probably about half of this positions but i felt like it was a good voice and engaging young people and that is a start as long as we can do it civilly um but uh and then i also just went back online because i have hammered on this committee multiple times i just went online and i found in pinterest that even today you could order t-shirt that says aca b one three point one two which translates to all cops or bastards or if you do not like that shirt you can go get a f the cop shirt at the same website on a location on pinterest uh there is clearly a problem with some of the voices of the left that i am not necessarily saying any members of congress that need to tamp it down having said that within 24 hours of mr. kirk's uh shooting we had the guy that does the podcast for the war room and another guy who is denied the sandy hook uh shootings say we are at war now how on earth and i do believe it is a smaller number but it is a number that has an influence how on earth are we desk de-escalating the situation with the tensions as high as they were last week with going out and saying where a war i am not asking you to respond to this question i am just saying that there are people out here on our side of the aisle that still need to look in the mirror even if you agree that it is a lower number bad as bad no matter how many numbers they are and those cut that kind of rhetoric and that kind of mobilization makes your job more difficult and puts us in a position where we are not being as productive as as you want the fbi and state and local law enforcement to be i am finished i just want to thank you for your service i want to thank you for your concise answers and i am thoroughly impressed with the fact that you have sat in that chair for over four hours without a break so with that we are on behalf of the chair i want to thank you for being here today and uh and also i assume we leave in the record open for any period of time for one week the record will be open i left open for one week so that you may have questions for the record mr. patel thank you for being here thank you mr. chairman meetings adjourned you you
