senator justice statement on democrat’s government shutdown washington, d.c. – today, senator jim justice released the following statement after senate democrats rejected a clean government funding bill and forced the federal government into a shutdown: “this shouldn’t be a food fight. senate republicans put forward a clean bill to keep the government open: a bill similar to what democrats have voted for 13 times in the past. now, west virginians will face the fallout of a democrat forced government shutdown all over political demands. this is not negotiating, this is plain and simple political sabotage at the expense of the american people. in west virginia, we have always done what’s right: we mind the store, put our people first, and use common sense to make decisions. it is time for democrats to stop the games and work with us to reopen the government,” said senator jim justice . background: democrats have previously advocated for the kind of clean, nonpartisan bill republicans put forward. democrats have voted for a clean cr 13 times under joe biden and as recently as march 2025. democrats are holding government funding in order to pass a long list of partisan demands including free healthcare for illegal aliens with a total price tag of around $1.5 trillion. a democrat forced government shutdown leaves american troops unpaid, jeopardizes services such as social security, and delays veteran health programs. senator justice has now voted twice to keep the government open under a clean funding bill, which has been rejected by senate democrats on both occasions. # # #
