washington – u.s. senator bill cassidy, m.d. (r-la) introduced the humanoid robots oversight and blocking of obtainment from totalitarians (humanoid robot) act to ensure the united states remains the leader in robotics and protect american systems from adversarial nations accessing them through humanoid robot technologies. the bill would prevent federal agencies and their contractors from using humanoid robots developed by china, russia, iran, or north korea, while establishing oversight of foreign investment in u.s. humanoid robotics. “americans win when we lead in technology,” said dr. cassidy. “we’re keeping that lead by blocking countries like china from putting their robots in our workplaces and homes.” humanoid robots are expected to become increasingly integral for industrial, household, and defense applications. although the u.s. currently leads in this field, hostile nations are investing in the technology, posing risks to american data, national security, and economic strength. cassidy was joined by u.s. senator chris coons (d-de) in introducing the legislation. ### print email share share
