washington – u.s. senator bill cassidy, m.d. (r-la) announced that louisiana has become the first state in the nation to receive full federal approval of its plan to deploy $1,355,554,552.94 billion in broadband internet funding from his infrastructure investment and jobs act . “i was proud to negotiate the infrastructure bill to secure this $1.36 billion in funding for louisiana. access to high-speed internet is essential for every small business owner, student, and worker. i am grateful to president trump for his work to get it moving,” said dr. cassidy. while negotiating the infrastructure bill, cassidy pushed for a fair broadband formula that would benefit louisiana’s needs and ensure the funding was directed to areas that lacked access to high-speed internet. the formula is based on the number of unserved and underserved broadband recipients in each state as determined by updated broadband internet-coverage maps. a map of louisiana residents accessing broadband internet before cassidy’s bill was passed can be found here . ### print email share share
