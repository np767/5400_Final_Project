improved economic conditions and addressed difficult issues like insurancebecause of these reforms automobile insurance rates are finally coming down—between 6 and 105 average reductions for the three largest companies—even as rates continue to skyrocket nationwideand our homeowners’ insurance market is seeing stability 1 new companies have entered the market 130000 new private policies over the past year in 2024 florida had the lowest increase in rates of all 50 states 73 of citizens homeowners in miamidade are scheduled to receive a decrease on average of 63 the fact is that the legislature

members of the legislature you are entrusted by your constituents to exercise sound judgment on their behalf you have been more productive than any legislature in america over these past six years you should be proud of that work and of your willingness to serve as teddy roosevelt famously said“it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while doing greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat”my friends we have great opportunities over the next sixty daysthe people of florida are watchinglet’s work together to solidify our successes and address the challenges before usour voyage is not yet
