senator 0000 thank you thank you thank you thank you welcome to wisconsin 170 years ago the republican party was born here founded on the principle of freedom and dedicated to the fight to end slavery it is an honor and privilege to represent the good decent hardworking and very nice people of wisconsin in the us senate like most americans they believe the purpose of government is to help improve lives not make them more difficult unfortunately vice president harris and president biden had made our lives less safe and far more expensive in other words a lot more difficult 0106 back in 2008 joe biden ran on a ticket promising to âfundamentally transform americaâ they werenât joking that was the democrats new radical farleft agenda todayâs democrat party is not the party of our parents and grandparents that party cared about workers and people struggling to get by now they are the party of open borders reckless spending weaponized government and weakness on the world stage this fringe agenda includes biological males competing against girls crowd 0149 boo senator 0152 and the sexualization and indoctrination of our children crowd 0158 boo senator 0202 todayâs democrat agenda their policies are a clear and present danger to america to our institutions are values in our people democrats have forgotten american families they have abandoned the hardworking middle class for president trump and republicans those forgotten americans are forgotten no more republicans are the party of opportunity liberty and prosperity for all we proved we know how to make life better for all americans and we can do it again with a secure border smaller government less regulation and lower taxes 0256 republicans understand that americans donât want welfare they want work they donât want woke equity they want godgiven equality crowd 0314 woo senator 0314 they want the promise of our founding documents the right to pursue happiness thatâs what republicans will deliver weâve repaired the damage caused by democrats before and we will do it again we will complete the mission president trump first articulated in 2016 to make america great again thank you and god
