my name is ryan moore from south sioux city, nebraska. my family began our friendship with hillary over 20 years ago. back then, she was first lady, fighting for healthcare reform. as a person with a rare form of dwarfism, my family knew that my life was going to be filled with surgeries and hospital visits. so, we were grateful when hillary asked to hear our story. for me, quality, affordable healthcare was more than a privilege, and even more than a right. it was an absolute necessity. i am thankful that she is kept up to fight over the years, and i am honored to call her my friend. here's what i can tell you for my years knowing hillary clinton. she is compassionate. every time i see hillary, she remembers meaningful details about my life, sometimes from years earlier. when i first met her, i was seven years old and wearing a back brace. two years later, when i saw her again, she patted my back and said, you do not have a back brace anymore. i could not believe that she remembered that. a lot of people would not have. a lot of people would not have, but she did. she is thoughtful. every time i have a big operation coming up, i always receive a note from hillary, full of encouragement and kindness. she lifts my spirits. she helps me believe that everything is going to be all right. most of all, she is genuine. something happens when you meet hillary. no matter how busy she is, and how pretty sure she is always really busy, she makes you feel like the most important person in her day. she blocks everything else out and just focuses on me, how my job is going, how i am feeling. she really cares. and i know that so many people who have met her over the years say the exact same thing. i wish everyone could get to know hillary's heart like i have. she always looks out for the little guy, no pun intended. and that is why i am so proud to support hillary clinton as our next president. thank you.
