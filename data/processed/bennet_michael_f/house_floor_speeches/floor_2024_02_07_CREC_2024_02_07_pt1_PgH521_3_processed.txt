[congressional record volume 170, number 22 (wednesday, february 7, 2024)] [house] [page h521] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] another education department failure (ms. foxx asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) ms. foxx. madam speaker, roughly 18 million students fill out the free application for federal student aid, fafsa, each year. yet, this week, the department of education celebrated 3.6 million forms being submitted. that is 20 percent, a failing grade in any classroom, yet the biden administration considers this success? countless students and families are being negatively impacted by this administration's outrageously incompetent implementation of a bipartisan law passed more than 3 years ago. the department had plenty of time to prepare for the fafsa rollout. instead, it zealously and recklessly pursued an illegal student loan scheme. the department's actions have had real consequences. students are hurting, especially low-income students who are most dependent on taxpayer aid from the federal government. the department promises that colleges will receive financial aid information in mid-march. given this department's empty promises and missed deadlines throughout the past year, i will not hold my breath. ____________________
