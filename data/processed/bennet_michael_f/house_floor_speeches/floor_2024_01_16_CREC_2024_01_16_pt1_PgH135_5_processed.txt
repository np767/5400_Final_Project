[congressional record volume 170, number 8 (tuesday, january 16, 2024)] [house] [page h135] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] israeli hostages' awareness the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from tennessee (mr. kustoff) for 5 minutes. mr. kustoff. mr. speaker, this past sunday marked 100 days since hamas, an iranian-backed terrorist organization, brutally slaughtered, tortured, and kidnapped innocent israelis. on the morning of october 7, 2023, these barbaric extremists murdered individuals and families in cold blood. they raped women; they beheaded infants; they mutilated bodies; they burned people in their homes; and they abducted men, women, children, and the elderly. these are things that are very hard to say on the floor of the house of representatives. this is an incredible statement: more jews were murdered on october 7 than on any other single day since the holocaust. today, 136 innocent hostages still remain in hamas' custody in gaza. our hearts ache with the families of the hostages. we will not rest until every single one of their loved ones returns home. we are waiting for the hostages, and we are fighting for them. that is why i am honored and privileged to lead a bipartisan initiative in the house of representatives to highlight the stories of these innocent hostages. together, it is my hope that we can bring awareness to those viciously kidnapped by hamas, and we can clearly say with one voice: bring them all home. i will begin by sharing the story of agam berger. agam, who is 19 years old, was more than one of 240 innocent israelis taken captive by hamas terrorists on october 7. according to family and friends, agam loves to volunteer with people with special needs and with children who have learning disabilities. agam and 135 hostages are still being held captive in gaza, enduring incredible torture and trauma. agam's father, shlomi berger, said that he dreads what his daughter is going through after viewing footage of her wounded and scared along with three other teenage hostages. hamas should release agam immediately, along with all of the other remaining hostages. our country's strong support for israel must not waver. it is time to bring agam home. it is time to bring all of the innocent hostages home. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to join me in this crucial effort to demonstrate our support for the hostages and for their families. ____________________
