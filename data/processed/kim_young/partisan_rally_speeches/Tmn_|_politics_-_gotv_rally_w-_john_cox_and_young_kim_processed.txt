thank you, sir. thank you. thank you. thank you. in your entrance, can i have a stand-alone? sure. you know, we have got to have jobs and opportunity for people. yeah, he is doing an event with chelsea handler today. he is doing an event with a bunch of congressional candidates. he does not even mention your name when he is out on the stump. do you think that he is sort of looking past this election? well, listen, he made washington the whole issue in this race. he wants the run for president. i want to fix california. we have got 40 million people here who are really struggling. and, you know, i know what it is like to struggle. and i care about what is happening to this state. people are, you know, spending 40, 50% of their incomes on housing. there is nothing left at the end of the month. when i am the governor of this state, one of the first things i am going to do is we are going to call a special session. and we are going to come up with a whole lot of ways to fix this housing crisis. we are going to try to streamline the regulations, shorten the approval process, do something about the taxes and impact fees that people are paying. all of these things are driving up the cost of housing. that drives up costs all over the place. i mean, food costs, gasoline, everything that just keeps making this state unaffordable. and it just cannot keep going on like that. and last question, this is the end. people are deciding your closing argument, the last, most important thing you want people to know as they head in to make their decision. this is the status quo versus change. this state is so tough for people. there is so many people that are moving out or thinking about moving out because they cannot afford to live here. that is the status quo. i represent change. i am going to cut the regulations and make sure that people can build truly less costly housing. we are going to get our education system improved. it is now 47th in the nation. we are going to make sure that people have water. we have got water rationing coming in 2022. that is not going to happen on my watch. there is a lot of things that have been run badly by the people of this state. by the people who have been leading this state. we need to have the courage. real courage is voting for something different. voting for change. that is what i represent. and i think when the people really sit down and decide they are going to vote for change and not the status quo. we are going to have a quick shot of the two of us talking and we will let you be on your way. yeah, john! john, i got one question. go on. i will see you. i have to make a decision. okay. calmedability is sacramento. poundability. you have got it. okay. okay, so last push, last weekend. yes. you want to tell voters who are on the side right now. you know, this is about change. i represent change. my opponent is the status quo. it is as simple as that. we have got the highest cost of living in the country, the highest poverty rate, the highest rate of homelessness. which he did nothing about when he was the mayor of san francisco. it is worse than ever. i represent attacking these problems and solving them. that is what i have been doing in the private sector for 40 years as a businessman. getting results, delivering change. the people of this state cannot live here affordably anymore. cost of housing is out of touch, out of sight for most people. the cost of gasoline is now $5 a gallon in areas of los angeles. the political class in sacramento is responsible for driving up those costs. i think we need a check and balance on what our legislature has been doing. i represent that check and balance. i represent real change. we have got so many areas in this state that need change that i think the people will vote for that. contrary to what the polls are saying right now, your campaign is saying people will be surprised from tuesday. i think they will. i think they will. i mean, the polls are the polls. the only one that counts as they say is the one on election day. but i think people, there is an undercurrent. there is really an undercurrent of people who are really disappointed in the leadership of this state. how can you be defending a school system that is 47th in the country? how can you defend 150,000 or so homeless people on our streets that are making life difficult for themselves and for the rest of us as well? how can you defend housing prices that are triple, triple what they are in most parts of the nation? you cannot defend that. and a lot of that is caused by the political class. and they have to be held accountable. i represent change. i am going to work with people on solving these problems. but i am going to push for the change that we need. thank you very much. thank you. we have got to go straight to the bus. sir. i have got our question. so we are out of time. you have to go to the next one. how do you do with workers? well, that is just what it is got to do. here's the worker calls. it is the trial. it is the trial. the browns and the california is going to get used to the fires. move him. move him. move him. thank you. that is what i want to go through. yeah. just over here. there it goes. yeah. one, two, one. yeah. two, three, two, and seven. there it goes. that is what i am going to do. oh my god. come on. come on. come on. come on. come on. help us on the way. help us on the way. help us on the way. help us on the way. help us on the way. help us on the way. john coffitt governor. john coffitt governor. john coffitt governor. john coffitt governor. alright. can you move forward? come on. see this. we are heading up to riverside park. to riverside county, in norco, and coroner area. we are gonna support dola salie, a candidate for the assembly. but really, and truly, what we are gonna do is bring our message. and our message is very, very simple. this state has not been run well. it is unaffordable, it is unlivable. we are gonna be the change that is gonna make this state affordable and livable. we are gonna start by repealing the gas tax. we are gonna stop the train that is wasting money in the central valley, and we are gonna take some of that money, and we are gonna build roads and bridges. but we are also gonna rebate a portion of that back to the people and refund their registration fees that they have paid under this gas tax. we are gonna bring true change and accountability to this government, true check and balance. and we are gonna make this state affordable and livable. we are gonna make our schools number one. we are gonna help the homeless get back into productive lives. and we are gonna make sure that people can afford a home, afford gasoline, afford electricity, and- i cannot tell you about the reaction of your bus. oh, we have got a great reaction to this bus. i mean, all up and down the highways of this state, we are getting people that honk their horns, give us a thumbs up all across this state. i mean, it is tremendous. and you know, i will tell you the most important thing. you see that first word? help. that is what the people of this state are crying out for. help. help. help. they do not want more handouts. what they want is a chance to buy a home. what they want is a chance to have an apartment they can afford. what they want is a chance to be able to fill up their gas tank and not have to worry about whether they are gonna be able to buy groceries next week. what they want is the ability to actually take a shower or a bath because there is water available. this is where the political class and gavin newsom have failed. i am done with failure. i want success for the golden state. and that is what we are gonna have on november 6th. let me go. yeah, let us go. hey john, thanks. all right. peter means loser and boy health insurance. remember that. thanks. thank you, all the point. you are doing great. thank you very much. no, we are practicing. but the next generation, better education. ok, check it out. everything. it is very long. yes. come visit daniel. hey, john. thank you very much. all right, go. hey, how is my job?

because it is working guys. they are out here. they are just paying for you. all right, so what is the point? hi, joey. ok. let us sports stars. they get paid millions dollars. we will get paid millions dollars. but this impacts our nation in such a huge way. everything is a state, right? everything. and in these final days, the only thing that impacts this race above and beyond anything is turning in these votes. for the last year, year and a half, in some cases, beyond volunteers like yourself have been calling voters in the field and asking them what they care about. do you care about this issue? how do you feel about that issue? do you support our candidate? now we are in the final phase of those people who agreed with us, who supported us, who let us know what they are thinking and are going to be getting out to vote, right? so we are not in an nfl stadium. we are not getting paid millions of dollars. but you know what? we are walking on the field right now. this is that high stake level of game. ok, the stakes are that high. so while you are here and sometimes the phones quiet, and we are just waiting to get that caller on the line, think about it. volunteers like you are going to be here all day, every day. you are going to talk to dozens of people by the end of the day. dozens of yeses. dozens of yeses. dozens of yeses. dozens of yeses. this adds up. we are in a race. we have this office. we have the office in the harbor. we have the office in your belinda. our opponents are doing the same thing. we are in a race right now. final 72 hours. the contact those most important people make sure they turn in their balance. ok? so just keep in mind when you get someone on the phone. do you support? absolutely. do you need to vote? can i tell you where your polling place is? do you need to mail in your ballot? make sure they understand. ok? so just thank you guys for all the hard work and effort that we put into this. and as soon as this is ready to work on a roll. so does anyone want to give it a shot real quick and since you have to. it is back. it is back on. hold it back on. thank you. thank you. i did not win the step. i did not have the, what was the, so i saw you. you followed the order. thank you. thank you. i am sorry. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you.
