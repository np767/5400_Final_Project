sep 26, 2025 | press releases washington, dc – today, u.s. representatives young kim (ca-40) and adam gray (ca-13) introduced the bipartisan heats act to reduce burdensome permitting delays on geothermal projects and help expand energy production across the united states. the heats act streamlines the permitting process for geothermal energy projects by eliminating duplicative federal requirements when a valid state permit is already in place. for projects on non-federal land where the u.s. holds only a minor stake, the bill ensures development can move forward without unnecessary federal delays. “energy independence built this nation, and it must fuel our future,” said rep. young kim. “we need an all-of-the-above energy approach that strengthens our national security and keeps costs down for everyday americans. the heats act does exactly that by cutting unnecessary red tape and bringing more affordable, reliable energy online. for working families in california, where energy bills have nearly doubled in the past 15 years, this bill can’t reach the president’s desk fast enough.” “california’s energy prices are too high thanks to burdensome state and local regulations,” said rep. adam gray. “the bipartisan heats act would lower energy costs for valley families and move our country toward energy independence by unleashing geothermal production. i’m proud to work with rep. kim to introduce this bill to secure safe, reliable clean energy, create good-paying jobs and drive down prices for the valley.” the heats act passed the house with strong bipartisan support last congress. read the bill here . signup to receive our email newsletters subscribe the latest news reps. kim, beatty introduce resolution recognizing october as national financial planning month nov 21, 2025 washington, dc – today, u.s. representatives young kim (ca-40) and joyce beatty (oh-03), co-chairs of the bipartisan... rep young kim leads bill to support first responders, help prevent wildfires nov 18, 2025 washington, dc – today, u.s. representative young kim (ca-40) introduced the bipartisan, bicameral fire innovation... rep young kim votes to release the epstein files nov 18, 2025 today, rep. young kim (ca-40) put out the following statement on her vote to release the epstein files. “the american... read more news
