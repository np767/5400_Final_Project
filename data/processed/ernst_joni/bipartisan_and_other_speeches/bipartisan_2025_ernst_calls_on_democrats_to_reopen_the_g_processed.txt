it’s a simple yes vote from our friends across the aisle. “they have shut the government down. we have provided opportunity time and time again to open the federal government, to pay our federal government workers, to make sure our skies are safe, to make sure our military members are paid, to make sure snap benefits are getting to every family that struggles with food insecurity. “all it takes is a yes vote. “we have told the democrats we are willing to sit down and negotiate on the aca – the unaffordable care act – and other opportunities. we will do that when we open the federal government. “democrats are not fighting to lower premiums. they are fighting to raise profits for health insurance companies. “democrats are terrified of the truth about their temporary covid credits. it’s welfare for the wealthy and corporate welfare rolled all into one. “democrats are demanding that republicans vote to make their handout scheme permanent. “their plan is to line the pockets of health insurers with half a trillion dollars in taxpayer-funded subsidies. “thanks to democrats, insurers are pocketing record profits fueled by taxpayer subsidies. “extending the biden covid credits would cost taxpayers half a trillion dollars. “democrats shut down the government to protect obamacare subsidies that send $40 billion to insurance companies—not to the families that need it. “so, let’s be very clear. this argument isn’t about helping american families that need better options for health care insurance. it is about sending large wads of money to health insurers. “let’s come together to figure this out folks. “we are the united states senate. we are the u.s. government. “this never would have been allowed to happen when i was serving in the united states military. you come up with courses of action, you decide on the best course of action, and you follow through with that mission. “we expect our servicemembers to do this every single day. they are at the behest of the united states federal government. “we need to open up the federal government and ensure they are paid. “let’s take care of our families. let’s take care of the food insecure folks – not just in iowa, but all across the nation. let’s make sure our farmers are able to make their farm payments this fall. “all it takes is a simple yes from our democratic friends.” ### previous next website-search
