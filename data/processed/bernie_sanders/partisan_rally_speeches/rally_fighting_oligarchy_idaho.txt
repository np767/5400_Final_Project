infringingbernie sanders 0007 â¦ alexandria they told us this was a conservative state they got it wrong before i go on i want to say a word about alexandria yes she is an excellent congresswoman from new york yes she has been an inspiration to young people all over the country but i want to say something that is even more important about alexandria six years ago she was a waitress in new york city and she looked around her in a community which has a whole lot of issues she looked around her and she said you know what we can do better with no money no organization she took on one of the most powerful democratic leaders in the us congress and she beat him now my point is not to grow her ego thats not my point in saying that my point is to say that in this arena of 12000 people there are hundreds of alexandrias and josephs and toms and marys and why we are here today is not just to be with you in this rally as wonderful as that is we are here for a deeper purpose 0216and that is to understand that in this very very difficult moment in american history all of us have got to get outside of our comfort zone we have got to do tomorrow what we hesitated to do yesterday and as alexandria just said when we stand together when we do not allow them to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation there is no stopping us i know that there are some pundits out there and theyre saying why does bernie sanders and alexandria ocasiocortez who come from some of the most liberal and blue states in the country why are we here tonight and the answer is we dont accept this blue state red state nonsense we are one people thats right we are the united states of america not red states not blue states the country now faces some enormous problems and at the top of the list we have a nation which is now run by a handful of greedy billionaires i used to talk about oligarchy and people say what is he talking about everybody knows what im talking about tonight 0438when trump got inaugurated sitting right behind him were the three wealthiest people in this country musk bezos and zuckerberg and seated right behind them were 13 other billionaires who trump had nominated to lead major government agencies some of you remember a lesson we learned in elementary school when abraham lincoln was at gettysburg and he was on the battlefield where 20000 union soldiers had died or had been wounded just a few days ago and he looked out at that battlefield and he said we are not going to forget the sacrifice they made we are going to make a government of the people crowd 0535 by the people for the people bernie sanders 0538 thats why were here tonight we want a government of the people by the people for the not a government of the billionaire class for the billionaire class and by the billionaire class and right now unbelievable as we speak you got the wealthiest guy on earth mr musk mr musk you dont hear about this much in the corporate media or on the halls of congress mr musk himself owns five times more wealth than the bottom half of the households in america one man and this guy is running all over washington dc slashing the social security administration and what that means what that means is elderly and disabled people will find it increasingly difficult to get the benefits they paid into this guy is proposing to cut 83000 jobs from the veterans administration these are the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our country we owe them everything and were not going to allow musk and his friends to cut va benefits and when we talk about oligarchy its not just economic power it is political power right now in this last election musk spent 270 million to elect donald trump bernie sanders 0800 trump is president you get one vote you get one vote musk gets one vote plus 270 million to elect trump and his reward is to become the most powerful person in government but it is not just musk and the republican party the democrats have their billionaires as well and if you want to know why the democrats over the years have not been as strong as they should be in standing up for workingclass people it has a lot to do with the power of those billionaires so i know that i speak not just for progressives or moderates or conservatives i think i both speak for every american who understands that in our democracy we cannot allow billionaires to buy elections in america one person one vote not billionaires buying elections and that is why we got to overturn this disastrous citizens united supreme court decision i want to say a word about the oligarchs because its something i really dont quite understand one might think that if you had 10 20 30 billion dollars it would be enough you might think that but in america we have a lot of people who are dealing with addiction issues drugs alcohol or whatever well these guys these oligarchs have a major major addiction problem and you know what it is it is greed theyre like heroin addicts they cant control themselves they need more and more and they do not care who they step over in order to get another billion dollars 1029so we are going to take care of their addiction problems were going to end their greed but brothers and sisters it is not just oligarchy we are dealing with right now we are dealing with a president who undermines our constitution every single day who threatens our freedom of speech and assembly and whose agents as we speak are rounding up innocent people off the streets throwing them into unmarked vans and taking them to detention centers in this country or elsewhere can you imagine can you imagine i dont know if some of you saw some of these videos woman walks down the street suddenly car stops these guys come in plain clothes masks on throw her into a car and whisk her off someplace happened in vermont today 1147that is what happens in dictatorships not in democracy were not going to let trump and his friends get away with that and again i dont care whether youre a conservative or a progressive men and women have fought to defend our democracy and our constitution and were not going to let trump destroy that constitution what this guy wants is more and more power the guys who wrote the constitution back in the 1790s were nobodys fools and they wrote a constitution which had a separation of powers you all remember reading about that in the fifth grade you got an executive branch you got a legislative branch you got a judiciary and each one of those branches keeps a check on the other one and day after day what trump is doing is trying to take power away from the congress hes trying to take power away from the judiciary and right now hes going after the media i dont know if any of you saw it he is now wanting to take away cbss license because they did a story that criticized him 1325oh my word cbs criticized him oh lets drive them out of business how terrible is that he has sued abc he has sued meta he has sued the des moines register this guy cannot take criticism he can dish it out all right but he cant take it and i say to mr trump if you cant take criticism get out of the political process this is a democracy and if you can believe it he is going after law firms that represented clients who are in opposition to trump and some of these cowardly law firms have caved in one might think that the function of a large multibillion dollar law firm is to defend the rule of law not cave in to donald trump 1440and he is putting pressure on universities as well good news is harvard university today said go to hell during world war ii inaudible 001505 the united states of america and our allies were fighting fascism in the east and in europe 400000 men and women died to defend american freedom we take as americans as the longest standing democracy on earth is a country that the whole world has historically looked up to and they say we want to be like america we love the american constitution we respect their democracy we take democracy seriously we will not allow trump to undermine our way of life too many people have fought and died to defend democracy bernie sanders 1603 but it is not only domestic policy that we should be concerned with for the first time in the 250year history of our country we have a president who is aligning himself with dictatorship abroad no president trump ukraine did not start that war russia did 1643but its not just ukraine trump is following in the rather unfortunate behavior of joe biden and wants billions of dollars more to fund netanyahus war machine in gaza israel like any country on earth has the right to defend itself from terrorism but it does not have the right to wage all our war against the palestinian people in a territory of only 22 million people netanyahu has already killed 50000 palestinians wounded over 100000 and destroyed the entire infrastructure of gaza i am doing my best to demand not another nickel for netanyahus war machine 1824and as bad as all of that is as bad as the reality that american bombs are killing children there is something now even worse trump and his friends have the brilliant idea that they want to forcibly expel the suffering people of gaza push them out so they could build a riviera for their billionaire friends that is absolutely insane we will not allow that to happen and let me now tell you just a little bit of whats going on in america that youre not going to see on corporate media and youre not going to hear on the halls of congress and that right now in america we have two americas we have on top one america in which the wealthiest people the top 1 have never ever had it so good in america today we have more incomeâ¦ in america todayâ¦ audience 2012 inaudible 002105 bernie sanders 2109 okay okay all right let me move on toâ¦ i know that this is a sensitive issue something i am helping leading the effort in congress but i do want to say hold it hold it what we have also got to focus on is the crisis facing not only the people in gaza but the crisis facing the working class of this country and the way we beat trump is we develop an agenda that speaks to the needs of the working class of this country not just the 1 2158today in america 60 of our people are living paychecktopaycheck do you all know what living paychecktopaycheck is about audience 2212 yes bernie sanders 2213 all right i grew up in a family that lived paychecktopaycheck in a rentcontrolled apartment i know something about it all right you tell me what is living paychecktopaycheck audience 2223 cant pay rent bernie sanders 2226 you cant pay for the rents what else audience 2227 inaudible 002230 bernie sanders 2230 you cant afford what audience 2231 groceries bernie sanders 2232 cant afford groceries one of the at a time one at a time people all over this country want to provide good quality food for their kids they walk into a grocery store they cant afford it what else do you got audience 2246 inaudible 002251 bernie sanders 2251 what audience 2252 healthcare bernie sanders 2253 healthcare all right one at a time people get sick and in this country they cant afford to go to a doctor we lose 60000 people a year because they dont have a money to go to a doctor when they should if you are a single mom you cant afford childcare if you are a college student youre going to go deeply in debt to try to get the education you need to get a decent job meanwhile while working families struggled to put food on the table the richest 1 live in their own fantasy world you may have seen just the other day jeff bezos took some of his friends to outer space when they go on vacation they go to their own islands that they have bernie sanders 2400 â¦ fly around the world in their own planes our demand is an economy that works for all not just a few now i want to deal with an issue and i want you all to put this into your hearts back in 1940 long time ago franklin delano roosevelt one of the great presidents in american history roosevelt gave a state of the union speech this is in the middle of world war ii and it didnt get a whole lot of attention he said you know what we have a great constitution freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of assembly but you know what were lacking what we are lacking is an understanding that economic rights are human rights 2454so you have the right to vote but if youre sleeping out on the street it doesnt matter you have the right to vote but if you cant afford healthcare it doesnt matter so what we need to do is to understand and not let the establishment beat us down economic rights are human rights what that means is that musk should not be able to own himself five times more than half of the households in america what it means and this is not a radical idea it is not a radical idea we are the richest country in the history of the world we are not a poor country we do not have to have people sleeping out on the street or kids going hungry we dont have to have 20 of our elderly living on 15000 a year or less we dont have to have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major nation on earth so what do we have to do what we have to have is an agenda that speaks to the needs of all americans whether you are in idaho vermont or any place else brothers and sisters healthcare is a human right we should not be the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare at every man woman or child we need to pass medicare for all 2715instead of spending a trillion dollars on the military we need to build 5 million units of lowincome and affordable housing we need to have the best education system in the entire world i want the best and the brightest to go into teaching i want the teaching profession to be respected i want us to have free child care and i dont want our older kids to have to leave college deeply in debt free college tuition and despite what trump says climate change is not a hoax it is an existential threat we can lead the world and create millions of goodpaying union jobs transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency 2855let me conclude by reading you a quote from frederick douglass you all remember frederick douglass he was a great abolitionist and in the midst of the struggle to end the nightmare of slavery back in 1857 this is what he said and i quote power concedes nothing without a demand it never did and it never will find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress now what the ruling class of this country wants you to believe is that you are powerless theyve got all the money they own the media they own the economy they own the political process youve got nothing thats what they want you to believe but tonight we are going to stand up loudly and proudly and tell them we have had enough this country belongs to all of us not the billionaire class lets go forward lets do it thank youtopicspoliticshungry for moreluckily for
