right here in greeley meatpacking workers shouldnt have to live with disfigured hands because of the companys brutal line speeds my clients across colorado shouldnt have to pay 100 bucks a month 200 bucks a month in illegal and hidden junk fees to the richest corporate landlord in the country my client shouldnt have had to sell her late husbands wedding band in order to pay off medical debt to a billiondollar hospital system and my client shouldnt hear that the next time he asks for a paycheck hell get a bullet in the head and a call to ice none of this should be happening not in the wealthiest country in the history of the world not a couple of hours from aspen where a 100 billionaires own homes but billionaires have rigged the system to avoid being accountable to us 0115amazon says that it doesnt even employ my clients that they work for thirdparty middlemen so that when they unionize amazon can cut the contracts corporations pack our terms and conditions the fine print with clauses that say we cant hold them accountable in court even when they steal from us even when they break the law and they pump money into our politics to try to avoid being accountable to us even at the ballot box donald trump just named one of amazons top unionbusting lawyers as the top lawyer for his labor board is that what jeff bezoss milliondollar inauguration gift buys a million dollars that he earned on the backs of my clients peeing in bottles none of this should be happening but we cant give up and it starts right here in colorado 0228governor polis has threatened to veto the worker protection act a law that would make it easier for workers to unionize so call him tell him he can stand with us or he can stand with donald trump and jeff bezos and elon musk and its not just that we dont need the same old polltested stale talking points we need leaders with the courage and the vision to hold corporate power accountable to break up monopolies to enforce the laws that built the middle class to protect our planet and to crack down on the oligarchs that have seized our country and stolen the american dream from us they have spent billions billions protecting the power of their wealth so lets show up with more of us and more of us and more of us and hold them accountable to us i love you guys song interlude 0414 introducing aoc alexandria ocasiocortez 0439 hello greeley how are we doing today are you ready to fight are you ready to win are you ready to build a better world lets do this thank you all so so much for making the effort and taking the time out of your day to be here in community with us today thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you now greeleyâ¦ well first of all my name is alexandria some of you may know me as aoc but im so happy to be here today and thank you so much for welcoming me to greeley i really appreciate it now i hear that you have a representative who has not done a town hall ill say usually your first three months on a new job you are on your best behavior and working your hardest and doing your best i dont know if anyones had like a probationary period at a job before could you imagine if we had those for members of congress 0625anyways all of that is to say if this is the best that you all are getting i think you deserve better i think you deserve better now my home is a ways from here but in truth i think the distance between us is a lot shorter than we think and even that were told and in fact i think that we are all here together because we share in the frustration and the heartache that comes from watching those in power actively tear down or refuse to fight for everyday working americans like us and i really get it i was born in a working class family my mom cleaned houses my dad worked really hard to try to start a small business in order to do their best to give a better future to my brother and i and they worked really hard and for a minute there a minute it looked like our american dream was within grasp 0744we grew up and we really struggled but my parents worked so hard and it really started to feel like things were starting to work out i worked really hard i was able to get into college and suddenly my dad was diagnosed with a really rare cancer out of nowhere and by the time i was 18 years old he had passed away and i think this is an experienceâ¦ while it is really difficult i think a lot of us have had experiences like these where we work so hard and we are one event away from feeling like the whole rug got pulled out from under us and we shouldnt have to live like that we shouldnt have to live like that after my dad passed away my mom then overnight was basically a single mother to two kids she was cleaning houses she started driving school buses and when i graduated from college i started waiting tables in order to help make ends meet and this was right after the great recession and folks know how hard it was to come by a job at that time 0903and so thats when i started waiting tables to make ends meet and i know that we just deserve so much better than this we do we deserve so much better than this and were here together because an extreme concentration of power and corruption is taking over our country like never before and we are here because we do know that a better world is possible but to get there we need to be honest about where we are right now we are witnessing an oligarchy in america and that is when those with the most economic political and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of americans pay the price and our political system is illprepared for this abuse of power in fact much of our political system enables it starting with the role of money in politics 1020but im here to remind you greeley that we are not powerless in this moment people are starting to put the pieces together and i do think thatâ¦ sorry people are starting to put the pieces together and in fact ironically most of the divisive forces in our country are actually bringing more of us together than ever before and thats important because the same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country and they derive their power from dividing working people apart they specialize in getting us to turn on one another and they get us to turn on one another along lines of left and right race and gender creed and culture theyll throw out every label and judgment and cultural debate in the book to keep us distracted because the last thing they want us to realize is that the division that is actually hurting our country the most is how endless greed is costing the lives of everyone else 1153they want us to think that our lives are suffering because of the lgbt kid down the street or because of the mixed status family or the dreamer down the block whos just trying to make a better life for themselves but were smarter than that greeley we know better than that and i understand that this kind of disdain that the wealthiest wealthiest people in this country have for the working class doesnt just come from them not being raised right its shorthand for the right wings entire political agenda and a certain ugly kind of politics a politics that involves lying to and screwing over working and middle class americans so that they can steal from our healthcare social security and veterans benefits to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest and bailouts for their crypto billionaire friends and greeley theres a word for this kind of thing corruption 1312i know how seeing all of this stack up from how overwhelming and selfish all of this is from seeing the notifications on our phone popping up monday the department of education being rolled back tuesday trying to end birthright citizenship i get how all of it can make us feel despair and i get how even it can make the best of us feel like giving up and giving in and trust me that is by design that is by design when the system is stacked against you its hard to feel like anything you do matters its hard to feel like we matter in this democracy and it is easy to give in to despair and i can tell you there i can tell you that for a while there when i was working double shifts tired to the bone i did i did i did try to give up i tried to stop caring i tried to just keep my head down and work my shifts and accept that this is just it and this is how things are but that is no way to live its no way to live and what i do know is that we do not have to live like this in fact we cannot live like this anymore and ill say donald trump does see the immense pressure that working people are under but his answer is an america that operates on the principle of every man for himself divide and conquer and now that trump is back in power we see it clear as day hes handed the keys to elon musk and is selling off our country for parts to the wealthiest people in the world for a kickback and in exchange those billionaires and oligarchs will back his campaigns and bankroll those of his allies they scratch his back and he scratches theirs and all of us are left behind and the clever thing that these guys sell is making working people like you and me believe that were just one step outside from that club that were just a little bit out from being able to be a billionaire too any billionaires in this room i didnt think so 1605now its this idea that if we just work hard we too can have nationstate level money except these kinds of spoils arent earned really they arent working for these billions theyre stealing them theyre stealing them theyre stealing them from you and you and me just look at what elon musk and donald trump are doing to our healthcare our veterans benefits and social security they are slashing programs that we and you have spent a lifetime paying into and by the way not them because those billionaires havent paid their fair share of taxes in years and mind you even if youre not on medicaid or medicare this also raises your private health insurance costs too and lets talk about medicaid and medicare for a second because your representative dave evans you know that guy that hasnt been showing up for the last couple months maybe he hasnt been showing up because he voted to cut medicaid 1736in fact every single house republican voted to cut medicaid and theyll tell you no i didnt i didnt say that but heres what it is they voted on a budget that cuts 880 billion from the committee thats in charge of medicaid and so now theyre trying to play a game and say we didnt do that because they did by proxy so lets set the record straight and you see these budgets arent just fights about numbers they are fights over the values that define us as americans medicare medicaid and social security were built on promises that we have made to each other about who and what kind of country we want to be and what kind of society we want to live in healthcare and medicare and medicaid and social security these are not promises from politicians to people theyre not charities or handouts from billionaires to the working class alexandria ocasiocortez 1902 this is our money theyre promises that we have made to each other as americans from neighbor to neighbor teacher to student friend to friend and what we can say to elon musk is get out of our healthcare because to me greeley the strength of our country is not just measured by the height of our best days its measured by who we are and who is there for us on our worst and thats why im here with you today so let me share with you exactly what i mean because what these folks want to call radical and crazy i think are just common sense we live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world so i believe that when a person gets sick they shouldnt go bankrupt common sense i believe that a minimum wage should cover the minimum cost to live common sense and by the way we should see that not paying a living wage is also a form of corporate welfare and handouts because big companies like walmart and amazon rely on food stamp programs and public assistance to cover the wages that they wont pay greeley heres another crazy radical idea for you i believe that homes are not slot machines for investors and wall street to extort working families out of every last dollar that we have home is sacred and when your landlord doubles your rent overnight or when housing prices skyrocket because wall street treats our housing market like a casino your government and your public servants should fight to help you keep an affordable roof over your head 2136hows that for crazy and i believe that our elected officials should take on abuses of corporate greed everywhere we find it we must get big money out of politics and really thats why i dont and never will take money from industry lobbyists or corporations mass media and fox news and the right well have you believe that these american values are something out of the communist manifesto they believe that we think these things because we went to some fancy college and read them in a book somewhere but ill tell you i dont believe in healthcare labor and human dignity because im an extremist or a marxist i believe it because i was a waitress because ive scrubbed toilets with my mom to afford school because ive worked double shifts to keep the lights on because i lost my dad to cancer as a kid and had to see my mom open hospital bills in the days after and i dont want us to live like this anymore greeley 2311we deserve better than this and this isnt just about republicans we need a democratic party that fights harder for us too but greeley that means our communities choosing and voting for democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class and i want to thank the entire state and each and every one of you for working so hard to make that happen and ill tell you when people want to think that theres no hope out there trust me that there are moments of bravery that are emerging last week republicans put on the floor a draconian awful budget bill that cut billions from healthcare and from working people in fact one of the worst parts of what republicans voted for including gabe evans voted for last week is cutting benefits for the pact act for veterans exposed to burn pits 2440who does that thats like cartoon villain stuff right there but i will say colorado that when other democrats caved your senators michael bennet and john hickenlooper stood strong against the dc pressure and voted no they said colorado deserves better than this 2511thank you for putting in that work and in fact all the democrats all the democrats in the state of colorado and congress who represent a congressional district in the state voted against that bill too house senate everybody so i want to thank diana degette joe neguse jason crow brittany pettersen defend them colorado and dont stop there i want you to look at every level of office around and support democrats who fight because those are the ones who can actually beat republicans 2557but our work isnt done here because you know which coloradans did vote to gut medicaid and jack up healthcare costs gabe evans and lauren boebert right next door so folks you know what that means right we need to come together and spend every day between now and election day working to educate our neighbors and give evans and boebert the boot and replace them with a brawling democrat who will stand for colorado in fact if you will indulge me for a moment since gabe hasnt been around here if we could just say hi to him for a moment can we just say hi see you in november 2652thank you ill make sure he sees that but beyond elections greeley our task here is to build community thats the deeper the deeper deeper deeper mission that we have elections they come and go we do our work we set the board but in the meantime and during throughout before and after all of that we need to build our bonds with each other as communities building community block associations neighborhood groups volunteer groups church organizations ptas because community is the most powerful building block we have against fascism to defeat authoritarianism and to root out corruption if you dont know your neighbor its easier to turn on them thats why they want to keep us separated alone and apart scrolling on our phones thinking that the person next to us is some kind of enemy but theyre not so ill end where i began we might all come from different places but we share a lot of the same experiences so to all of those who came here today unsure of whether this is where you belong i want to tell you that you do you do honestly no matter who you voted for in the past no matter if you know all the right words to say no matter your race religion gender identity or status no matter if you disagree with me on a couple of things if you are willing to fight for someone you dont know you are welcome here 2906if you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are how they identify or where they come from you are welcome here but i will say this those leaders on either side of the aisle who are willing to put their fellow americans down so that they can get ahead or feel better about themselves those folks may best find a home somewhere else because in this house we stand together we know that that its our only choice because we know that without exception if we stand together it is the only way that we can win so i hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests but about class solidarity 3009its about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect 3022no matter who we are or where we come from we are here today to make a sacred promise to each other because our goal here today and what i dont want for us today what i want more for us today is not just to come together share a few inspiring words and then go back to how things were cant do that our goal here today is to commit to building the kind country we all deserve so im going to take another second here and i want each of you to turn to the people around you and get a good look and i want you to greet someone you dont know 3111and this is awesome and i think its i dont want to interrupt but its because if i can offer one assignment today before we all depart here its to leave this place connected to a new person you didnt know coming into this because greeley we do need to make that promise we do need to take care of each other on our worst days and to share the successes of our best and in making those promises to each other thats how were going to do it no silver bullet not from the top but block by block 3213so thank you for having me and it is my honor to introduce to you the senator the man the friend the person who has helped bring all of us here together today senator bernie sanders song interlude 3247 â¦ to the people power to the people power to the people power to the people power to the people power to the people right on say you want a revolution we better get on right away well you get on your feet and into the street singing power to the people power to the people power to the people bernie sanders 3343 thank you greeley i was told that you have a little bit over a hundred thousand people in greeley and between the 6000 who are outside and the 4000 who are here i think we got 10 of the community at this rally right now thank you now i want to say a word about alexandria when alexandria was a kid you correct me if im wrong she cleaned houses with her mom in order to make enough money for the family to survive and then after she graduated college she was a barista working paycheck to paycheck but what she did as she looked around her and in her community in bronx new york is she saw that change had to come and so what she did is decided to run for congress and people said what are you kidding 3506the guy who represents the district was one of the most powerful members of congress he had access to unlimited kinds of money how much money did you have when you started alexandria ocasiocortez 3520 none bernie sanders 3520 none all right but she did what real politics is about real politics is not sitting at million dollar fundraisers its working with people in your community and she worked hard and her friends worked hard and she pulled off and major upset and since then she has been a great member of congress but not only that she has been an inspiration to millions of young people all across this country 3614now the reason i say all of that is not just to praise alexandria and i love her but is to tell you and the people of america that what alexandria did you can do there are millions of young people out there who love this country who are disgusted with what they are seeing who are prepared to get involved in the political process so alexandria thank you for being that inspiration so why are alexandria and i why are alexandria and i here today why will we be in denver later this evening why were we in tempe last night where there was an unbelievable number of people coming out las vegas earlier than that well be in tucson tomorrow why are we doing that and were doing that because this country faces a set of enormous crises bernie sanders 3800 â¦ crises and how we respond to this moment will impact not only our lives but the lives of our kids future generations and in terms of climate change will impact the future of this planet audience 3823 yeah 3825whoo bernie sanders 3830 what i have to tell you is that given the huge turnouts we have seen already on this trip it is clear to me that the american people are outraged at whats going on and the american people are saying loud and clear we will not accept an oligarchic form of society we will not accept the richest guy in the world running all over washington making cuts to the social security administration audience 3922 boo bernie sanders 3922 â¦ cuts to the veterans administration audience 3926 boo bernie sanders 3928 â¦ almost destroying the department of education audience 3931 boo bernie sanders 3934 â¦ all so that they could give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 audience 3942 inaudible 003942 3942boo bernie sanders 3946 but its not just oligarchy weve got to deal with under trump this country is moving very rapidly to an authoritarian form of society audience 4002 boo 4002inaudible 004003 bernie sanders 4002 today we have a president who is undermining our constitution every single day audience 4009 inaudible 004010 4009boo bernie sanders 4013 â¦ who is threatening freedom of speech and freedom of assembly audience 4017 inaudible 004017 4017boo bernie sanders 4020 i look back at the civics class that i took in the sixth grade a few years ago you probably took the same class we studied american history we studied the constitution audience 4033 inaudible 004037 bernie sanders 4036 its important to remember what we learned back then and that is that the founding fathers of this country way back in the 1790s they had fought a war against the allpowerful king of england and the british empire and theyre thinking how do we create a new country in which one person will never ever have the kind of power that the king of england has audience 4106 yeah bernie sanders 4106 so with a lot of debate and these were really smart guys a lot of debate they said you know what we are going to do is create a government and a constitution which has a separation of powers audience 4127 yeah bernie sanders 4127 that means were going to have a executive branch and a president a lot of power were going to have a congress a lot of power were going to have a judicial branch a lot of power audience 4138 inaudible 004139 bernie sanders 4140 that is what they put together and that is precisely what donald trump today is trying to undermine audience 4150 yeah 4150boo bernie sanders 4155 first amendment to the constitution is the allimportant freedom of speech audience 4201 whoo bernie sanders 4206 in a way that is unprecedented trump is trying to intimidate the media and anyone who speaks out against them audience 4217 boo 4217inaudible 004223 bernie sanders 4222 he loves the media when they fawn all over him audience 4229 boo bernie sanders 4229 but like other cowards he cant stand to be criticized audience 4233 inaudible 004235 bernie sanders 4239 trump has sued abc cbs meta and he sued the des moines register because he didnt like a poll that they did audience 4249 boo bernie sanders 4252 his fcc is now threatening to investigate pbs and npr audience 4259 boo bernie sanders 4304 he has called cnn and msnbc illegal audience 4309 boo 4309inaudible 004313 bernie sanders 4313 in other words the socalled leader of the free world is afraid of freedom audience 4322 yeah bernie sanders 4326 well mr president if you are too cowardly and too vain to accept criticism then get out of politics because that is precisely what democracy is about audience 4354 yeah bernie sanders 4354 thats what the beauty of democracy is about its your ideas and my ideas and we argue about them and we vote on them its not do as i want or im going to investigate you audience 4408 inaudible 004410 bernie sanders 4410 but it is not just the media that he is going after hes going after the constitutional responsibilities of congress congress under the constitution has the power of the purse and every day he is challenging that slashing funding without authority that only congress can do audience 4433 yeah bernie sanders 4435 â¦ trying to wipe out agencies that congress has created and only congress can eliminate but its not only the media in congress that he is going after the third branch of government is the judiciary and what they are supposed to do what the federal courts do is rule on whether laws are constitutional in their judgment or not what the president does constitutional or not there have let me tell you been many decisions coming down from this supreme court that i abhor audience 4516 yeah bernie sanders 4516 their citizens united decision one of the worst decisions ever rendered audience 4525 boo bernie sanders 4525 their decision to overturn roe v wade a horrible decision audience 4529 boo bernie sanders 4533 but those of us who live by the rule of law understand they have their powers we have our powers but now for the first time what trump is doing is saying to a judge who issues a ruling we dont like that ruling were going to get you impeached audience 4553 boo 4553inaudible 004559 bernie sanders 4558 president trump millions of americans millions of americans have fought and died to preserve american democracy were not going to let you take it away from us audience 4613 inaudible 004619 bernie sanders 4621 and we thank all of those veterans who put their lives on the line to defend democracy but its not just oligarchy and authoritarianism that is on our minds all over this country people are standing up and theyre saying we will not accept a society of massive income and wealth inequalities a society in which the very rich are getting much richer while millions of working families are struggling to put food on the table audience 4708 whoo bernie sanders 4708 what people are saying is that in the richest country in the history of the world we are going to fight for and create an economy and a government that works for all of us not just the 1 audience 4721 whoo bernie sanders 4735 all right im going to do something radical now you ready audience 4738 whoo bernie sanders 4738 all right audience 4738 inaudible 004740 bernie sanders 4741 im going to tell you the truth audience 4742 whoo bernie sanders 4744 i know pretty radical but what the hell only go around once audience 4747 inaudible 004750 bernie sanders 4750 i want to take a few minutes to describe to you what is really going on in this country audience 4756 inaudible 004757 bernie sanders 4757 its something that you dont see much in the corporate media and you certainly dont hear discussed in the halls of congress and that is in america today we have two separate americas on one hand we have an america in which the wealthiest people have never ever in the history of our country had it so good audience 4822 yup bernie sanders 4823 today we have more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had today we have three multibillionaires mr musk mr bezos mr zuckerberg audience 4843 boo bernie sanders 4843 these three combined audience 4844 inaudible 004846 bernie sanders 4848 â¦ own more wealth than the bottom half of american society 170 million americans audience 4859 boo bernie sanders 4859 now we dont talk about it much for obvious reasons but the idea that so few have so much and so many have so little is not what this country is supposed to be about audience 4915 whoo bernie sanders 4925 further lets take a look at concentration of ownership in the economy you know what we hear kids read in school books we are a society people go out and they start their own small businesses free enterprises great everybody competes against each other that aint the case audience 4941 no bernie sanders 4941 today you have more concentration of ownership in america than we have ever had in the history of this country in sector after sector whether it is agriculture transportation media financial services what you have is a small number of extraordinarily large corporations who charge us outrageous prices for the products that we have to buy audience 5009 boo bernie sanders 5011 let me mention just one example of concentration of ownership today audience 5015 inaudible 005017 bernie sanders 5017 nobody talks about it today youve got three wall street firms blackrock vanguard and state street you ever hear of these companies audience 5025 boo 5025inaudible 005029 bernie sanders 5028 combined combined these three investment firms are the majority stockholders in 95 of american corporations audience 5043 inaudible 005041 5043boo 5043inaudible 005044 bernie sanders 5043 these guys i want to tell you something because i bump into them in my line of work they are not nice guys audience 5050 inaudible 005052 bernie sanders 5052 i know on tv they come across â¦ and in your community they make a donation to the hospital or the boys girls clubs or the food shelf theyre just very nice but theyre not audience 5103 inaudible 005104 bernie sanders 5105 in america today as i think all of you know sadly and tragically and weve got to deal with it we have major epidemics dealing with addiction i think we lost a hundred thousand americans last year because of drug overdose its a serious problem in my state we have people addicted to alcohol serious problems with alcoholism we have people who were addicted to tobacco my father smoked two packs of cigarettes a day and he died before he was 60 people addicted to food but i will tell you this in the midst of all of these addictions the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs audience 5150 whoo bernie sanders 5158 now everybody wants to do well in life everybody wants to make money but you would think that if you had a few billion dollars or 10 or 20 billion you would not feel obliged to step on the backs of poor people to become even richer audience 5226 whoo bernie sanders 5226 but that is exactly what they are doing right now they are prepared to destroy social security medicaid medicare the veterans administration in order to make themselves even richer audience 5238 boo bernie sanders 5242 these guys have no sense of what goes on in the real world they live in another planet they own

are angry and they are angry all over this country they are angry because believe it or not despite a huge increase in worker productivity over the last 52 years if you could believe it real inflation accounted for wages today are lower than they were 52 years ago audience 5525 boo bernie sanders 5528 meanwhile there has been a 75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90 to the top 1 audience 5540 boo bernie sanders 5540 that is what a rigged economy is about and that is what we are going to change audience 5553 whoo bernie sanders 5556 so lets also take a look at other aspects of american society anybody here think our healthcare system is working well audience 5604 boo bernie sanders 5606 it is a broken and dysfunctional and cruel healthcare system we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare were spending 14000 for every man woman and child yet 85 million are uninsured or underinsured do you know what underinsured means how many people here have high deductibles audience 5631 inaudible 005633 bernie sanders 5633 what kind of deductible do you have maam do you know audience 5635 7500 bernie sanders 5637 7500 what do you got audience 5639 20000 5639inaudible 005640 bernie sanders 5640 how much audience 5642 20000 bernie sanders 5642 20000 audience 5642 inaudible 005646 bernie sanders 5646 deductible what do you got audience 5647 9000 bernie sanders 5647 9000 audience 5648 8000 bernie sanders 5650 8000 audience 5650 7000 bernie sanders 5651 7000 all right what does all of that mean it means that even though you have insurance when you get bernie sanders 5700 â¦ sick you still cant afford to go to the doctor how insane is that and you know what the result is we dont talk about it much 60000 americans die each year because they dont get to a doctor on time because theyre uninsured or theyre underinsured 5717and i want to deal with another issue youll excuse me for being professorial here and a little bit boring but its important that we know this and heres again a fact never or very rarely talked about all right heres the fact despite spending so much on healthcare our life expectancy how long we live is about four years younger four years shorter than other major countries thats bad that is bad but i want to tell you what is even worse and i want you all to think about it and help me out here if you are working class in america you will live on average about seven or eight years shorter lives than if you are wealthy in other words being working class in america is a death sentence all right question why is that why is that raise your hand tell me why yes maam speaker 1 5839 stress bernie sanders 5843 stress all right stress let me deal with that all right the woman here said stress and shes absolutely right what kind of stress are working class people living under today who wants to help me out on that hold on hold on whoa whoa whoa i cant get you all yes i see your hand there maam speaker 2 5902 survival bernie sanders 5903 survival okay stress means youre trying to survive every week okay more maam speaker 3 5909 i own a small business and i cant get corporations to pay their fucking bills bernie sanders 5916 i own a small business and i cant get corporations to pay their stash their bills yes maam speaker 4 5924 financial stress bernie sanders 5927 financial stress yes maam speaker 5 5929 taxes

bernie sanders 5941 what speaker 8 5943 dental work bernie sanders 5945 dental dental work thank you for raising that issue anybody have a problem with the cost of dental care in america bloody right all right other issues yeah i see your hand young man back there yeah speaker 9 010001 workplace safety bernie sanders 010003 workplace safety okay yes maam speaker 10 010004 mental health bernie sanders 010005 mental health all right look all right we could spend two hours going on here all right but here is the bottom line when you are struggling paycheck to paycheck you are worried about how you survive every single week and doctors call this almost the physiology of poverty that stress that you live with 24 hours a day eats away at your body and your mental health and that is the major reason why working class people are dying seven years earlier than the rich it is a shame but its more than a shame it is unacceptable and the point that i want all of you to get ingrained in your heads look if we were a poor country a country like haiti a really poor country i would say to you well im sorry you dont have good health care sorry you dont have good dental care sorry you cant send your kids to college were a poor country we cant afford it brothers and sisters we are the richest country in the history of the world there is no excuse for working class people dying seven years earlier than the rich 010141there is no excuse that one out of four americans cannot afford to fill the prescriptions that their doctors write for prescription drugs there is no excuse that in the richest country on earth 800000 americans are homeless and 20 million people including people in this room pay 40 50 of their incomes for housing no excuse no excuse that our childcare system is a disaster outrageously expensive while workers there are being paid low wages no excuse that our public schools are struggling trying to get teachers no teacher in america should make less than 60000 a year 010249so my friends why is all of this happening why is it that the rich get richer and working class people die younger than they should well it has everything to do with the fact that were living in an oligarchic form of society you know ive been talking about that for a few years but i think the rest of the world is catching on to what i was talking about and the reason is youve got to be dumb and blind not to see whats going on you got a president trump getting inaugurated and i must tell you one of the more bizarre experiences of my life was i was kind of pushed into the front row of that and there i am theres trump and right behind him you got musk bezos and zuckerberg three wealthiest guys in the country and then behind them you got 13 other billionaires who trump nominated to head up various government agencies abraham lincoln talked about a government of the people by the people for the people well trump has a government of the billionaires by the billionaires and for the billionaires 010420and what these guys are busy doing right now is going after medicaid going after social security going after nutrition the rich want to get richer and they dont care who they step on now it is imperative that we fight trump every step of the way and by the way it is not just on domestic issues this country has a 250year history and never before have we had a president ally himself with a terrible dictator like vladimir putin and on top of that trump wants to continue the disastrous policies of the biden administration and provide more funding for the netanyahu government to destroy the people of gaza 010527all right our job though is not just to play defensive weve got to get on the offensive as well and that means having a vision of where we as the wealthiest nation on earth the longeststanding democracy on the planet where do we want to go what kind of nation do we want to become and for a start the profound issue that must be dealt with is we must end this corrupt campaign finance system now i dont care if you are a republican democrat or independent i dont think theres anybody who thinks it vaguely makes sense that the richest guy in the world could spend 270 million to get trump elected and then become the most powerful person in the government thats not just republicans lets be clear billionaires are funding the democratic party and preventing that party from standing up for working families 010646bottom line we need to end citizens united move to public funding of elections trump wants to give massive tax breaks to billionaires our view its time that the billionaires started paying their fair share of taxes republicans refuse to raise the minimum wage we want to raise that minimum wage to a living wage at least 17 bucks an hour musk and bezos and others want to break unions we believe in the trade union movement workers all over this country want to join unions theyre being stopped by the illegal activities of corporations weve got legislation in that will end that lets pass the pro act 010750trump and his friends want to cut social security were going to expand social security by lifting the cap trump and his friends want to cut medicaid well we got a different idea were going to join the rest of the industrialized world guarantee healthcare to all its a human right were going to fight and pass medicare for all single payer in a competitive global economy we need the best educated workforce in the world young people should not go broke or in debt because they want to go to college or a trade school we desperately need doctors and nurses and teachers and carpenters and sheet metal workers and construction workers we need to make sure our people get educated without going into debt we need to make our public colleges universities and community colleges tuitionfree we need to save the planet and create millions of good paying jobs by transforming our energy system 010927all right we need an emt please all right we got a medical issue medical issue somebody fainted all right we need some help here please security speaker 11 010950 on the way on the way bernie sanders 010950 all right all right theyre on their way from the back lets take a break for a moment are we okay okay good all right thank you 011033you know trump and his friends talk about freedom well in a free society we must absolutely guarantee that it is the women of america who control their own bodies not the government look let me end on this note and the note is that this is a very difficult time in the history of our country its not the first difficult time that weve had remember weve gone through a civil war weve gone through slavery weve gone through workers trying to form unions and getting beaten up and killed weve gone through a depression weve gone through 1941 being attacked and not knowing how to respond weve gone through a lot of things but this is what i believe the essence of i think what we are about and that is if we stand together if we care about each other if you care about my family and i care about your family if we dont believe that the goal in life is just to make billions and step on other people and to lie cheat and steal if we believe that love and compassion is what motivates usâ¦ 011239now if there are some republicans here republicans watching and on the livestream republicans did not vote for donald trump in order to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut social security believe me they didnt and the reason that trump has been successful and why demagogues around the world are successful you know what they do they play one group off against another theyre telling you who youre going to hate and our job is to do exactly the opposite the right wing wants to divide us up based on the color of our skin or where we were born or our religion or our sexual orientation and our job is to come together now i dont have a phd in mathematics but i do know this that 99 is a hell of a lot larger number than 1 so if we stand together are strong are disciplined are smart i have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat trumpism but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve thank you very muchtopicspoliticshungry for moreluckily for you we deliver subscribe to our blog todaythank you for subscribinga confirmation email is
