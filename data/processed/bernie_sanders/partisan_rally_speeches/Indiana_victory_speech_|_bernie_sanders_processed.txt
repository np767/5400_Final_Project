let me just thank the people of indiana for giving us a great upset victory tonight i know all the pundants thought we were supposed to lose but that apparently was not what the people of indiana concluded um i understand that secretary clinton thinks that this campaign is over i have got some bad news for her uh uh tonight we won a great victory in indiana uh next week we are going to be in west virginia we think we got a real shock uh to win in that great state then we are going to kentucky and we are going to oregon we think we have a pretty good chance to win there as well then we are going to another bunch of other states uh culminating in the largest state uh in the united states with the most delegates and that is the state of california we think we have a pretty good chance to win there and i think think that as more and more delegates uh to the democratic convention take a hard look uh at which candidate is generating the kind of enthusiasm excitement vter turnout that we need to make sure that somebody like a donald trump does not become president i think you are going to see more and more delegates concluding that that candidate uh is bernie sanders and the reason for that is that the issues that we are talking about in this campaign are the issues that are on on the hearts and minds of the american people the american people are tired of working longer hours for low wages and seeing almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1% they are tired of super pacs and a corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires to buy elections they are tired of a broken criminal justice system which enables us to have more people in jail than any other country on earth they are worried about the future for their children and they understand that unless we create an economy that works for all of us and not just the 1% their kids are going to have a lower standard of living than they do and we are going to see the end of the american dream and we are not going to allow that to happen and the american people understand that in this great country we can do what every other major industrialized country on earth is doing and that is guaranteeing health care to all people as a right and to guarantee paid family and medical leave and by the way to demand when we have so much income and wealth inequality that donald trump and the billionaire class start paying their fair share of taxes so we feel great about tonight not only in winning here in indiana and accumulating some more delegates but also gaining the momentum we need to take us to the finish line uh and we are you know we started this campaign uh way way way behind uh nobody i think would have dreamed uh that here at this particular point uh in may of 2016 not only would we be here but we would be winning elections but we are so i i sense a great deal of momentum i i sense some great uh victories coming and i think that while the path is narrow and i do not deny that for a moment uh i think we can pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of the united states and in fact become the nominee uh for the uh democratic party and then once we secure that position i have absolute confidence that we are going to defeat donald trump uh in the general election thank you senator sanders uh after tonight it seems that donald trump is going to become the likely uh gop nominee will you commit now to saying whether or not you think he is a racist look i do not have to label i think that he virtually every day has insulted one group of people or another whether it is mexicans and latinos whether it is muslims uh whether it is women whether it is veterans whether it is african-americans let us never forget that before trump became uh a candidate for president he was one of the leaders of the so-called bera movement a movement which tried to delegitimize the presidency of the first african-american president we have ever had i will let people put the american people decide the appropriate label uh but this is a man who does not have the demeanor uh does not have the policy background or the ideas to become president of the united states i would love to run against them and i am absolutely confident that not only we would beat them but we would beat them by a pretty large number how does the win in indiana fundamentally change the race obviously your delegate count is it is going to give us a great deal of momentum because i think there are many in the media like you and others who have decided that the campaign is over well i guess the people of indiana did not quite agree with that assessment you know and i think you may be surprised to find out that the folks and i am not predicting you know i do not know what is going to happen but the people in west virginia may not agree with that assessment and the people of oregon may not agree with that assessment the people in our largest state california may not agree with that assessment so we think we understand and i do not deny it for one second that we have an uphill battle in front of us uh but i think we have a path toward victory although it is a narrow path our goal is twofold number one to win a majority of pledged delegates uh number two it is to make sure that in those states where we have won landslide victories you know 65 70% of the votes that the super delegates in those states listen to their constituents and vote the way their constituents voted in their state's primaries or caucuses and thirdly we are going to make the case to the super delegates many of them by the way came on board hillary clinton's campaign before i was even an announced candidate they were there way back when well the world has changed in the last year and i believe that we will be able to make the case to many of those superdelegates that what is most important is not whether hillary clinton or bernie sanders is the nominee what is most important is that we do not allow someone like a donald trump to become president of the united states and i think that according to every poll that i have seen in the last month bernie sanders defeats donald trump in the national polls by greater margins than does hillary clinton and bernie sanders beats uh donald trump by greater margins than hillary clinton in battleground state after battleground state after battleground state in other words i think the objective evidence is that i am the strongest candidate to prevent the trump from becoming president senator have you been senator you said yourself this week that you would have to win 65% of the remaining delegates to match clinton and pledge delegates it is not looking like indiana is going to be that kind of landslide it is a start it is a start i am looking forward to there are other states to come and we are looking forward to winning in west virginia uh looking forward to winning in kentucky looking forward to winning in oregon and as you know the state that has the most delegates is obviously california and we already have a a strong ground game in california we we have sent a lot of our people to california uh we are going to run an unprecedented campaign in california uh and with the help of the american people uh who have helped us so much right now with those $27 contributions at bernie sanders.com you know we have made history we have 7.3 million campaign contributions bernie sanders.com and with the help of the american people we are going to have the resources we need to win in california senator your fundraising dropped off pretty significantly you know i read an article in new york times those was the word you use plunged how do we compare to hillary clinton she ended up with a few dollars more than we did but for you it dro for just we about record-breaking the issue is i think we raised somebody correct me wrong $26 million $26 million in a month that is a pretty good sum of money from where i come from when we began this campaign nobody ever dreamed probably we would raise $26 million for the whole campaign let alone in one month yeah so our numbers went down and hillary clinton beat us by a few dollars this is we are taking on the most powerful political organization in america she raised $600,000 more than i do did not see the new york times make that point so we feel we feel pretty good and we feel that today's victory will probably help us but look we have enough money you know everybody always wants more money i do not have a super pack secretary clinton has a super pack but we have enough money to run a strong and winning campaign throughout how do you plan to maximize those resources to take you through california because that is a very expensive california is an outrageously expensive state in terms of media you are right and clearly we are not going to be spending $100 million or whatever it takes on media in california so we have to decide the best way to allocate our resources i think that what the focus of our campaign will be actually what it has been up to now and that is we are going to do a whole lot of rallies you know california has a lot a lot of large and and great cities and i think what we are going to end up doing we have brought out in this campaign up to today over 1.1 million americans to rallies that we have held i do not know i could be wrong in this i do not know that anyone has brought out more i may be wrong about that but that is my impression senator we are going to go to california and when we go to california you are going to see very large rallies up and down that beautiful state last question lauren okay uh senator today uh donald trump has been called a presumptive nominee they have their reports they are ramping up for the general election any concern that by extending the democratic primary that it is going to set democrats at a disadvantage from july not at all if you look at the polling out there there was a poll came out yesterday or today and they asked the american people uh has the democratic primary process invigorated the democratic party is it good for the democratic party by very large numbers the american people say yes what we are doing in this campaign and i am extremely proud of it we are literally bringing millions of people into the political process and the way you bring people into the political process is you engage in a serious issue oriented campaign and people come out and they hear the points of view of secretary clinton they hear my points of view they get involved and you know what those people then vote in the general election so i have no doubt zero doubt that what we have done in this campaign what we are doing now and what we will do in the next 6 weeks is good for the democratic party and it will result in a higher voter turnout and let me conclude by saying this democrats and progressives win elections when the voter turnout is high republicans win elections when the voter turnout is low and when people are demoralized i am going to do everything that i can to make sure that in november we have a very high voter turnout thank you all thanks everybody [applause]
