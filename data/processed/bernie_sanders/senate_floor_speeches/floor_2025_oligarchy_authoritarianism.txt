dangerous movement toward oligarchy authoritarianism kleptocracy february 4 2025 washington feb 4 – sen bernie sanders ivt today gave remarks on the floor of the senate outlining the trump administration’s movement toward oligarchy authoritarianism and kleptocracysanders remarks as prepared for delivery are below and can be watched herem president today we find ourselves in a pivotal moment in american history and millions of americans by their actions or lack of action will determine the future of this country for decadesm president in my view the trump administration is moving this country very aggressively into an oligarchic form of society where extraordinary power rests in the hands of a small number of unelected multibillionairesthe trump administration is moving this country very aggressively into an authoritarian society where the rule of law and our constitution are being ignored and undermined in order to give more power to the white house and the billionaires who now control our governmentin my view the trump administration is moving this country very rapidly toward a kleptocracy – where the function of government is not to serve the people of america but to enrich those who are in powerm president i think that today is a good day to recall what one of our great presidents said at gettysburg in november of 1863 looking out at a battlefield where thousands of union soldiers had just sacrificed their lives in the defense of freedom lincoln famously stated“the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us – that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion – that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain – that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom – and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth“government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth”m president under president trump we are not seeing a “government of the people by the people for the people” quite the contrarywe are seeing a government of the billionaire class by the billionaire class for the billionaire class and it’s not being done secretly it’s right out there for all to seeseveral weeks ago donald trump was inaugurated for his second term as president of the united states standing right behind him were the three richest men in the country – elon musk jeff bezos and mark zuckerberg – worth a combined 920 billion these 3 men have more wealth than the bottom half of america – 170 million people and i should point out and this should tell you exactly where we are going as a nation these 3 men have become some 232 billion richer since trump was elected in just two weeks under trump their wealth has exploded by 232 billion dollarsm president this is how an oligarchic system works elon musk the richest person in the world and now a key part of the administration spent over 277 million to get trump elected in other words within a corrupt campaign finance system he helped buy the election for donald trumpjeff bezos and mark zuckerberg the second and third wealthiest people in our country both kicked a million each into trump’s inauguration fundand let’s remember that mr bezos who owns the washington post rescinded the endorsement of kamala harris of the washington post’s editorial board mr bezos was showing early on that he was willing to bend the knee for donald trumpmark zuckerberg the founder and ceo of meta which owns facebook and instagram agreed to settle a lawsuit with trump for 25 millionthese three multibillionaires are working with trump because they understand one very important reality trump’s policies are designed to make the very richest people in this country even richersince trump’s election mr musk has become 154 billion richer mr bezos has become 35 billion richer and mr zuckerberg has become 43 billion richerm president i am growing increasingly concerned that in our country under the leadership of president trump we are moving rapidly towards authoritarianismand all over this country people are alarmed and shocked by what they are seeingjust a few exampleslast week trump attempted to suspend all federal grants and loans in direct violation of the us constitution and federal law as every 3rd grader knows the power of the purse belongs to congress not the presidentlet’s be clear the president can recommend legislation he can veto legislation but he does not have the power to unilaterally terminate funding and legislation passed by the us congress that is a dangerous and blatantly unconstitutional actand i should add that trump’s blocking of federal funding would have had an horrific impact on millions of americans who utilize programs like medicaid head start community health centers meals on wheels homeless veterans’ programs and many many other initiativestens of millions of americans including some of the most vulnerable people in our country were impacted by that decisionbut that’s not alla few days ago trump fired 17 inspectors general – independent government watchdogs that were created by congress in the wake of the watergate scandal to prevent the abuse of power by the executive branchlast week president trump fired a member of the national labor relations board and in so doing effectively neutered the only federal agency in america with the authority to hold corporations accountable for illegal union busting and to protect the constitutional right of workers to form a union and to collectively bargain for better wages benefits and working conditionsnot only is this move blatantly illegal it is exactly what elon musk the owner of tesla and jeff bezos the owner of amazon have been fighting for for months this is a huge gift to the two wealthiest people in our country who are both strongly antiunionthe president also illegally fired members of the equal employment opportunity commission – the only independent commission in our country that protects workers against discrimination in the workplacefurther and this should upset every american regardless of political view in direct violation of the constitution and federal law trump is intimidating the media with lawsuits against abc cbs meta and the des moines register his fcc is now threatening to investigate pbs and npr take a deep breath my fellow americanswhat trump is essentially saying to every media outlet in america if you say or do anything that is critical of me that displeases me you may be subject to a lawsuit or a federal investigationif this is not a direct attack on the first amendment the us constitution and freedom of speech i don’t know what isbut that’s not allelon musk and his unelected minions at doge have forced out officials at the treasury department and illegally shut down us aid – a program which among other things helps feed and provide medical help to starving and desperate children all over the world presidents much less unelected billionaires do not have the unilateral right to shut down federal agencies established by congresswhen we talk about the dangerous movement towards authoritarianism let us not forget trump’s pardoning of the january 6th insurrectionists who injured 174 police officers at the capitoleven worse trump is undermining the fbi by investigating the agents there who helped bring these violent criminals to justicein other words what trump is saying is that violence against police officers when done in his name is ok but when law enforcement officers try to hold criminals accountable that is not okm president under trump we are rapidly moving towards a kleptocracy as welljust before trump was inaugurated he and his wife melania launched their own cryptocurrency coins giving them the potential to earn tens of billions of dollarsm president if wall street ceos tried to bribe the president with a bag full of money that would be against the lawbut now they don’t have to do thattoday if a multibillionaire or the head of a foreign country wants to curry favor with the president all they have to do is buy his cryptocurrency coins and when they do that they are directly enriching donald trump and the first ladythat is unacceptable and cannot standso m president the question then becomes where do we go from hereinstead of moving toward an economy which is designed to benefit the very richest people in our society we have got to fight hard to create a government that works for all of us not just mr musk or mr bezos or mr zuckerberg and other multibillionairesm president at a time of massive wealth and income inequality we must not provide more tax breaks to billionaires paid for by huge cuts in medicaid and other programs that working families and lowincome people desperately needbut let me tell you what we should be doingat a time when 85 million americans are uninsured or underinsured we have got to do what every major country on earth does and that is to guarantee health care as a human right to every man woman and child in this countryat a time when 1 out of 4 americans cannot afford the medicine that their doctors prescribe we have got to end the absurdity of americans paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugswe have got to cut the cost of prescription drugs in halfm president the federal minimum wage of 725 an hour is a starvation wage while 60 of our people live paycheck to paycheck we must raise that minimum wage to a living wage at least 17 an hour if you work 40 hours a week you should not be living in povertymr musk and mr bezos want to make it harder for workers to join unions well we have got to do exactly the opposite we must pass the pro act so that antiunion ceos cannot act unconstitutionally to deny workers the right to join a unionat a time when we need the best educated workforce in the world we need to have the best public schools in the world and among other things that means we need to substantially raise teacher salaries if we want the best and the brightest to become educators no teacher in america should earn less than 60000 a yearm president all over this country we have a major housing crisis and it’s not just the 800000 who are homeless it is millions of working families who are spending 40 50 or 60 percent of their limited incomes on housing instead of spending almost a trillion dollars a year on a wasteful and bloated pentagon budget we have got to build millions of units of lowincome and affordable housing and when we do that we put large numbers of people to work at goodpaying union jobsm president i hear from trump supporters that the president won the election and he has been given this huge mandate to do whatever he wants well no president has the right to move us to oligarchy authoritarianism and kleptocracy but more importantly let us not forget that while trump did win this election he actually received 4 million fewer votes in 2024 than biden did in 2020 when biden won the election prevpreviousnews sanders statement on voting “no” on rfk jr nextnews sanders murray baldwin scott delauro demand answers on trump’s plans to dismantle
