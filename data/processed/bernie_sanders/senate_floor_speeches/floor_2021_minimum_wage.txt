news reporting teaching scholarship and research fair use is permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringingspeaker 2 0114 the senator from vermont mr sanders for himself and others proposes an amendment numbered 972 to amendment number 891 at the end of title to add the following subtitle m increasing the federal minimum wage bernie sanders 0129 lets let the entire amendment be read i ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be waived speaker 1 0137 is there objection without objection bernie sanders 0142 madam president i rise today to offer an amendment to increase the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of 7 and 25 cents an hour to 15 an hour over a fiveyear period as i think you know the congress has not raised the minimum wage since 2007 and the result of that is that half of our people are now living paycheck to paycheck and many in fact are working for wages that are much too low in order to take care of their families so to my mind the american people in poll after poll in state after state understand that weve got to raise that minimum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks an hour and i intend to do everything that i can to make that happen and i will be offering that amendment this morning but before i do that let me begin my remarks by explaining why this reconciliation bill the american rescue plan that we are debating today is so enormously important that it must be passed and it must be passed as quickly as possible bernie sanders 0315 in my view this legislation is the most consequential and significant legislation for working families that congress has debated for many many decades now why is that and the answer is that is i think all americans know the last year last year that we have gone through has been in so many ways the very worst year in our lifetimes thats what it has been the working families of our country today are hurting in a way that they have not hurt since the great depression and they want their government to hear their pain and come to their aid and that is not too much to ask now a lot of folks in this country there are estimates that maybe 30 to 40 of americans have literally given up on democracy they are moving toward authoritarianism they are hurting their kids are hurting their parents are hurting and they look to washington for help in their democratic society and they dont see washington responding bernie sanders 0443 what they see year after year are policies which make the very very rich richer which enable large profitable corporations to not pay a nickel in taxes but for them they face eviction they face hunger they dont have healthcare they cant afford to send their kids to college and they are asking does anybody anybody in washington care about their lives so what today is about in a very profound way is whether or not we stand with the working class of this country that we say yes we live in a democratic society we understand what you are going through and were going to move as aggressively as we can to respond to your pain and improve your lives so this is not just a healthcare bill it is not just an economic bill it is not just an educational bill it is perhaps more than that this is a bill which will answer a profound question are we living in a democratic society where the us congress will respond to the needs of working families rather than just the wealthy and large corporations and their lobbyists thats what today is about bernie sanders 0616 it is dealing with the pandemic its dealing with the economy its dealing with education and so much more but most importantly it is dealing with the issue of whether or not we are hearing the pain that is out there and we are responding to it during the last year as everybody knows over 500000 americans have died of covid and millions more have been made ill unbelievable unbelievable what we have gone through in terms of this terrible pandemic covid has not only caused massive death and illness it has resulted in a way we have never experienced social isolation that means all over this country you got old people elderly people in their homes they cant interact with their grandchildren with their own kids with their friends you got young people who want to go to school want to socialize want to date want to do things that young people do and they cant do it and have been unable to do that for the last year and that has resulted in a very sharp increase in mental illness in this country something by the way that this legislation also deals with bernie sanders 0736 many americans young and old and middleaged are now dealing with depression anxiety disorder addiction seeing the growth of addictions and even suicidal ideation so this has been just an awful year for people in our country and in fact throughout the world but this last year has not only been a public health crisis as bad bernie sanders 0803 year has not only been a public health crisis as bad as that has been the pandemic has led as we all know to a terrible economic downturn which has resulted in millions of americans losing their jobs and their incomes and the shutting down of something like one out of four small businesses in this country just an unbelievable number go to any town in america and youll see their main street shuttered now thriving businesses no longer exist bernie sanders 0837 real unemployment in this country today is now over 10 further countless americans face the threat of eviction we have a moratorium on evictions which is the right thing but there is going to be a day when that ends and people are saying im 5000 8000 in debt what happens to me when the moratorium ends how am i going to pay my rent am i going to be one of the 500000 people already sleeping out on the streets bernie sanders 0912 millions more and we have seen this in vermont and i know youve probably seen it in minnesota its all over this country people lining up in their cars for food and it is something that none of us ever dreamed right in my own community burlington vermont hundreds of people lining up in their cars for food many of them never in a million years would have dreamed that they would be in that position and today the level of hunger in america is at the highest level it has been in decades bernie sanders 0942 and then on top of all of that we are in the midst of a pandemic people are scared to death about coming down with covid yet because of our dysfunctional healthcare system we have over 90 million people who are uninsured or underinsured in the midst of a pandemic bernie sanders 1003 but its not only the public health crisis we worry about its not only the collapse of our economy that we got to worry about it is whats happening to our young people because the pandemic has created massive disruption in our educational system from childcare through graduate school the majority of our young people have seen their education disrupted and think about all of the implications of what that means and it is likely that hundreds of colleges in america were struggling before the pandemic will cease to exist bernie sanders 1046 so you got a public health crisis half a million people dead an economic crisis real unemployment of 10 small businesses going out of business and an educational crisis meanwhile in the midst of all of that it is important to note that not everybody in this country is hurting what we are seeing in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality is a moment when in fact that gap between the very very rich and everybody else is growing wider incredibly during this pandemic over 650 billionaires in america have increased their wealth by more than a trillion dollars the 50 fivezero richest people in america now own more wealth than the bottom half of american society some 160 million people bernie sanders 1143 so the bottom line here is very simple in this moment of unprecedented crises the united states senate must respond to the pain of working families all across this country and we must respond in an unprecedented way which is what this legislation is about bernie sanders 1208 now madam president i want to say a few words about some of what is in this bill this is a 600page bill and i will not read it all again i think our clerks have had enough fun reading it last night but i do want to summarize some of what is in it bernie sanders 1234 most importantly what the american people want is they want to get back to a normal life they want their kids to go to school they want to go to work they want their businesses open and what the american rescue plan does is enable us to aggressively crush this pandemic and enable the american people to return to their jobs and their schools it will establish a national emergency program to produce the quantity of vaccines that we need and get them into the arms of our people as quickly as possible clearly we are making progress in that area more and more people are getting vaccinated but we still have a lot of work to do and this legislation will enable us to do that bernie sanders 1323 madam president at a time when so many of our people are hurting this legislation will allow us to provide 1400 in direct payment to every working class person in this country and to their kids and this is on top of the 600 that we provided last a month so if youre out there and you are a family of four earning less than 150000 or an individual earning less than 75000 youre going to get that check for 1 400 and for that family of four that is 5600 bernie sanders 1405 though i know that to somebody with a whole lot of money you know 5600 bucks aint that much but for a family that is struggling right now that cant pay their rent cant feed their kids that 5600 for a family of four could be the difference between desperation and dignity further at a time when so many of our people are unemployed this budget reconciliation act will provide 400 a week in supplemental unemployment benefits to over 10 million americans until the end of august if youre unemployed right now youre worried your unemployment check is your only source of income youre worried that its going to cease well its not this legislation will continue that check coming until the end of august this legislation understands that we have a childcare crisis in america and we provide the resources to provide childcare out to 875000 children bernie sanders 1513 and very importantly madam president we dont talk about this enough one of the absolute disgraces of our economy right now is the level of childhood poverty in america which is one of the highest for any major country on earth this legislation will go a long way toward cutting childhood poverty some studies suggest were going to cut it in half by expanding the child tax credit from 2000 to 3000 and 3600 for kids under the age of six so in other words we are about to cut childhood poverty in half in this country bernie sanders 1555 this legislation obviously deals with the horror of so many of our people facing hunger we put in very substantial bernie sanders 1603 of our people facing hunger we put in very substantial amounts of money for nutrition assistance for working families for kids for the disabled and the elderly this legislation will provide rent relief utility assistance and mortgage assistance to millions of tenants and homeowners who are in danger of eviction and foreclosure this legislation will protect the pensions of many millions of workers who are in danger of seeing their retirement benefits cut by as much as 65 bernie sanders 1641 madam president not only is this 19 trillion emergency covid relief package the right thing to do from a moral perspective it is exactly what the overwhelming majority of the american people want us to do the american people didnt want us to give tax breaks to billionaires the american people did not want as republicans fought to do throw 30 million people off the affordable care act the american people didnt want that but that is what the republicans tried to do under reconciliation we have a different idea yeah were going to use reconciliation which only requires 51 votes we are going to use it not for tax breaks for the rich not to throw people off of healthcare but to provide the help that working class people need all across this country bernie sanders 1739 madam president i am introducing as i mentioned earlier legislation and amendment today to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour because of an unfortunate and in my view misguided decision by the parliamentarian this reconciliation bill does not include an increase in the minimum wage to 15 an hour in my view it should have and i think the parliamentarian was dead wrong but more importantly it is an absurd process that we allow an unelected staff of somebody who works for the senate not elected by anybody to make a decision as to whether 30 million americans get a pay raise or not i dont care how the parliamentarian rules no parliamentarian should have that power if people here want to vote against raising the minimum wage they have that right want to vote for it and i hope you do you have that right but we should not shuffle off that responsibility to what unelected staffer thats wrong bernie sanders 1849 the amendment which i am offering today to raise that minimum wage to 15 an hour is cosponsored by majority leader schumer and i thank him for his strong support senator patty murray who was the chair of the health education labor committee senator ron wyden who was the chair of the finance committee and many others in this chamber in fact this amendment is similar in many ways to the legislation that i have authored which is cosponsored by 38 members of the senate and let us not forget this legislation was passed in the house and i want to thank my friends and colleagues in the house progressive caucus for their extraordinary leadership on this issue bernie sanders 1938 this amendment is supported by some 300 national organizations including the aflcio and virtually all of the major unions in our country and i want to thank in particular the seiu one of the great unions in america who have led this effort for years in terms of a fight for 15 where people working in mcdonalds and burger king have gone out on strike and said no we cant make it on 10 bucks an hour 11 bucks an hour i want to thank the seiu bernie sanders 2008 and because this legislation will help workers all across the board but it will significantly help women who are unfortunately forced into low income work more than the general population more than men and it will disproportionately help african americans and latinos who disproportionately are forced into low income work this legislation is supported not only by 300 organizations but by groups like the leadership conference on civil and human rights they understand that if were going to improve the standard of living of the africanamerican community weve got to raise that minimum wage it is supported by the national organization for women because again this raising the minimum wage is a womens issue in a very significant way not totally believe me there a lot of men out there who working for 9 10 11 bucks an hour but disproportionately it impacts women it is supported by unidos and other latino organizations supported by the american association of university women supported by indivisible justice for migrant women the national domestic workers alliance and the national womens law center and here is the simple truth and that is that in the richest country in the history of the world we can no longer tolerate millions of our workers being unable to feed their families because they are working for starvation wages and that is not what i say although i do say it its what the president of the united states does who very very strongly supports raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour and i thank him for his support bernie sanders 2202 you know when we look at the economy people look at the stock market they look at a whole lot of indices out there but at the end of the day we have to ask ourselves what is going on in the lives of ordinary people and it is not acceptable to me that half of our people live paycheck to paycheck and millions of people trying to get by on 9 10 11 bucks an hour and you know what you cant do that you cant do that in vermont and you cant do it in california you cant do it in minnesota you cant do that and our job is to make sure that we have an economy that works for all and not just a few and that in order to do that we are going to have to raise that minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour bernie sanders 2246 frankly it is disgraceful that congress has not passed an increase in the minimum wage since 2007 think of all the things that have transpired since then but congress has not raised the minimum wage since 2007 and the reality is that the minimum wage has lost over 30 of its purchasing power since 1968 minimum wage is worth a lot less now than it used to be when we increase the minimum wage madam president we will be giving over 32 million americans a much needed pay raise and lets be clear raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour is an enormously popular idea more than 60 of the american people in poll after poll support raising the minimum wage since 1998 this is really amazing you know i have some friends here who are nervous oh my goodness how radical can it be should we raise the minimum wage oh my god im scared of the american restaurant association well since 19 bernie sanders 2403 american restaurant association well since 1998 every time a state has had an initiative on the ballot to raise the minimum wage it has won in conservative states and progressive states put it on the ballot it wins just as one example just this last november election time joe biden lost florida donald trump won florida by three points but in that same election the people of florida and i say that to the two senators from florida 61 of the people in florida voted to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour florida voted for donald trump and voted to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour eight states over the years eight states and over 40 cities have adopted laws to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour its not a radical idea and as you know over just a few days ago the house of representatives did the right thing and voted to raise the minimum wage to 15 bernie sanders 2511 this is not a radical idea people want it states have done it the house of representatives has done it and now it is our turn to do what the american people want now in the last few days i have heard some concerns from my colleagues about one part of our amendment and that is the provision to raise the tip wage which now stands i want everybody to hear that tip wage for waiters and waitresses and all those people who get tips now stands at 213 an hour no you did not mishear me 213 an hour and that is the federal minimum wage for waiters and waitresses for barbers for hairstylists for parking attendants and others and that tip minimum wage has not been raised since 1991 30 years ago you think maybe its time to raise the tip wage from 213 cents an hour passed 30 years ago i think so bernie sanders 2619 the proposal in this legislation would raise that tip wage from 213 an hour to 1495 over a seven year period now time and again our legislation gets misrepresent people say oh youre raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour tomorrow no we are not tip wage is going to take seven years for better or worse thats what it is now the national restaurant association very powerful lobbying organization has suggested to members of congress that this legislation is opposed by restaurant workers and would be harmful to their interests this is not true one fair wage an organization representing service employees has just delivered to the white house a petition with 140000 signatures from service workers who are demanding that they receive the same minimum wage as every other worker in their state polling among service employees and nonservice employees also supports the reality that americans want our waiters and waitresses and other service employees to get a fair minimum wage now i have heard from some people that those people are working in the service industry are doing really well and they dont want an increase in the federal minimum wage the tips that they are receiving are covering all of their needs leave well enough alone they say well today 70 of tip workers are women who suffer from three times the poverty rate of the rest of the us workforce they are not doing so well they use food stamps at double the rate of the general workforce and suffer by the way from the highest rates of sexual harassment of any industry because they must tolerate inappropriate customer behavior to get the incomes that they need further and this is important and i want all of my colleagues to hear this the idea of moving tip wages to the same level as the overall minimum wage is not a radical idea bernie sanders 2831 it has been done in state after state it already exists in seven states in our country including california oregon washington nevada montana alaska and minnesota and i should point out that all of those states experienced a growth in the number of small businesses and restaurants after they abolished the tip minimum wage and guess what waiters and waitresses in these states received more tips not less and lets be clear this pandemic has made a bad situation worse for waiters and waitresses so right now madam president it is absolutely imperative that we raise that minimum wage to a living wage for all of our workers and that we raise the tip wage as well which is already law in seven states of the country right now and i see the senator from california mr padilla and were delighted that he is joining us and his state has been one of the leaders in this country in raising the minimum wage and i would yield the floor to him for his remarkstopicsno items foundhungry for moreluckily for you we deliver subscribe to our blog todaythank you for subscribinga confirmation
