reportersharenewsweek is a trust project membersenator bernie sanders ivt took to the senate floor on wednesday urging senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky to allow for a vote on increasing direct payments to adult americans from 600 to 2000to push his case the vermont senator referred to a tweet by president donald trump backing the higher payments as part of a coronavirus relief package and said that lawmakers in the upper house should be given the opportunity to voice their opinion on the dealhere are his comments in fulli want to concur with senator schumer for what he said and what he said goes beyond economics it goes beyond the desperation that tens of millions of working families are facingit goes beyond the struggles of the people of vermont or kentucky and let me just make it clear for the majority leader that 10 out of the poorest 25 counties in the united states of america are located in kentuckyloading twitter contentso many of my colleagues the majority leader might want to get on the phone and start talking to working families in kentucky and find out how they feel about the need for immediate help in terms of a 2000 check for adults and i have the strong feeling that the people of kentucky will respond no differently than the people of vermont or new yorkthis last poll that i saw it had 78 percent of the american people saying that they wanted and needed that type of help but this discussion frankly is not just about the economic struggling of working families in this country its not just the massive levels of income and wealth inequality its about basic democracyread morebernie sanders uses trump tweet to bash gop on senate floor ‘president is right’3 min readbernie sanders tells mitch mcconnell to ask kentucky families how they feel about 2k checks3 min readmcconnell accuses dems of bullying after kentucky gov endorses 2000 stimulus checks4 min readwhat we have to do here on the floor whether its senator schumer or senator mcconnell or me we have got to talk in legalese thats the language of the united states senate and the stuff sounds pretty complicated to the average personbut all that senator schumer and i are asking of the majority leader is a very simple request allow the members of the united states senate to cast a voteif you want to vote against 2000 checks for people in your state vote against it i see senator toomey has been clear about it i suspect he will vote against it i respect his opinion but all that we are asking for is a vote what is the problemin the house over twothirds of the members of that body including 44 republicans voted to say that at this time of economic desperation working families deserve help and they deserve a 2000 check and as senator schumer just indicated we have a very unlikely ally in president trumpnobody here will disagree with trump more times than i have and yet here is what the leader of the republican party says he says 2000 asapso even on this issue amazingly enough the president of the united states is right so what all of this comes down to my fellow americans is not even whether you agree with senator schumer or myself and 78 percent of the american people or you agree with senator mcconnell and i suspect senator toomey thats fine its called democracy we have differences of opinionall that i am asking is give us a vote whats the problem allow the united states senators to cast a vote as to whether or not they are for the 2000 check or whether they are against itwe will need as i understand 60 votes to win thats a big hurdle i dont know that we are going to win there are a number of republicans who to their credit have said they are ready to vote for it i suspect there may be more and when given the opportunity who will vote for it maybe im wrong maybe we will lose and i think that would be unfortunateall that im asking for right now is give us the opportunity to vote what is the problem with that so mr president with that i will now go to senate legalese and say quote i ask unanimous consent that at 1130 am on thursday december 31 the senate proceed to the immediate consideration of hr 9051 to provide a 2000 direct payment to the working class that the bill be considered read a third time and the senate vote on passage of the bill without intervening action or debatefurther that if passed the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the tablefurther that immediately following the vote on hr 9051 the senate proceed to the immediate consideration of the veto message on hr 6395 that the senate immediately vote on passage of the bill the objections to the president to the contrary notwithstanding with no intervening action or debaterequest reprint licensingsubmit correctionview
