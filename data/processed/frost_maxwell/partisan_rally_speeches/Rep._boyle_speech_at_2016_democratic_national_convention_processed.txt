representative brendan boyle from pennsylvania welcome to the nation's birthplace my hometown philadelphia right here in the sweltering summer of 1776 a nation was conceived not for a single race or religion but out of a shared commitment to powerful ideals that would inspire the world over my father came to america when he was 19 he came here to enjoy the same rights and pursue the same opportunities that our founders dreamed of two centuries ago he knew that in this country his children would be considered just as american as the descendant of the may flower my father's a janitor cleaning the same train stations many of us road past to get here tonight my mother was a school crossing guard my brother and i grew up in a small philadelphia row home where we were raised to believe that in this country if you work hard where you come from does not determine where you are going thanks to many sacrifices a lot of student loans and a little luck i became the first in my family to go to college as democrats our mission is to make more stories like mine more common not less so but all donald trump wants to do is tell you who is to blame to fan the flames of anxiety and to exploit them in the most negative divisive dangerous ways this is why hillary clinton's vision is so important it is the opportunity for wages that help americans join the middle class and stay there a plan to ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work a pathway to college and a ladder into the working world now donald trump says the american dream is dead why does he want to lead america when he does not even believe in america donald trump is wrong this is a remarkable country by geography and by destiny we are a land set apart we democrats come to philadelphia this week to reaffirm our commitment to our founding ideals we come here to renew our fight to make the american dream a reality for all we come here to elect hillary clinton the next president of the united states ladies and gentlemen please welcome representative raul grihalva from arizona
