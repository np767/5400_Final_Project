home news press releases november 10, 2025 congressman maxwell frost statement on senate passage of funding deal washington, d.c. — today, congressman maxwell alejandro frost (fl-10) released a statement following senate passage of a funding bill to temporarily keep the government funded through the end of january. in a statement, rep. frost says: “this funding fight was supposed to be about addressing the urgency of rising health care costs for 20 million americans brought on by this administration’s failed policies and republican inaction. instead, the senate gave up in exchange for an empty promise for a vote on extending current health care subsidies. americans don’t need empty promises, they need to be able to afford their health care premiums. “the last seven weeks of this shutdown say it all: republicans’ refusal to negotiate proves they have no real interest in lowering health care costs. “this deal fails our communities who elected us to stand up for them, but the fight isn’t over. i am a no on any vote that raises premiums for nearly one in four people in my district. i believe that in the richest country on the face of the earth, families deserve to get the care they need when they need it—and i will fight like hell to make that a reality.” ### print email share tweet previous article next article
