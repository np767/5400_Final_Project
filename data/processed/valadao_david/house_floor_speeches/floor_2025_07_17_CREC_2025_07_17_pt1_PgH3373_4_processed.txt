recognizes the gentleman from arkansas. general leave mr. hill of arkansas. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill in the record. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from arkansas? there was no objection. mr. hill of arkansas. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in strong support this morning of the clarity act. we have been here before, mr. speaker. just last year, we passed landmark legislation, fit21, with an overwhelming bipartisan majority to apply strong federal standards to digital asset markets. for more than 5 years, our committee has heard from dozens and dozens of experts, held numerous roundtables and hearings with market participants of all sizes in all segments of the market to learn more about the emerging digital asset ecosystem. we learned about the value proposition and relevant risks associated with digital assets and the use of blockchain technology. we have heard time and time again from market participants and regulators about the need for clear regulatory guardrails. we have talked about the need to fill those regulatory gaps that have left millions participating in crypto markets vulnerable. in fact, mr. speaker, both president biden in his executive order 14067, and president trump in his executive order 14178, identified those market regulatory gaps, asking congress to act to fill those gaps. in 2022, we certainly witnessed consumer harm when the financial services committee heard unprecedented testimony from an expert called in to clean up the failed digital asset crypto firm ftx and the mess it left behind. in his words, never had he seen such an utter failure in corporate controls. in its wake, then-chairwoman waters wisely stated: ``we need legislative action to ensure that digital assets entities cannot operate in the shadows outside of robust federal oversight and clear rules of the road.'' if we needed actions then, we certainly need it now. we risk history repeating itself, and that is why we gather today on the house floor. after years of bipartisan work and numerous iterations, this bill would apply rigorous rules to digital asset firms, prohibiting commingling of customer funds, and requiring capital recordkeeping and conflict of interest mitigation standards. importantly, the bill recognizes that decentralized finance, or defi, developers do not take custody of user assets nor do they control user assets. therefore, we should not treat them in the same way that we treat centralized actors who do have custody and who do have control over assets. it is important to note that in an agriculture committee hearing, the former general counsel of ftx usa himself testified: had we the regulatory structure provided for in clarity applied to ftx, its story--and he goes on to say--would almost certainly have had a much different ending. let us ensure that we learn from the past, mr. speaker, the digital asset ecosystem is evolving at a remarkable pace, enabling real-time settlement of peer-to-peer transactions, initiating a renaissance in applied cryptography and laying the groundwork for the next generation of the internet. the united states has long had the most innovative financial and technology sectors and the deepest and most liquid capital markets, but while other jurisdictions are building frameworks for the future of finance to be on-chain and digitally native, our great country, with those great characteristics, is lagging. for too long our digital asset regime has been the worst of both worlds: regulation by enforcement, which has pushed good actors to leave the united states, and the regulatory gaps that i talked about identified in both president biden and president trump's executive orders that have left consumers unprotected from the bad actors. now, today, we have an opportunity to reverse course and reestablish the united states as the global hub for digital innovation. to do so, we must close the regulatory gaps with commonsense rules. {time} 0930 mr. speaker, the clarity act does just that by leveraging the expertise of our two market regulators, the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission, to ensure wraparound oversight of digital asset markets, from initial sales, raising capital, to daily trading, it provides clarity for banks engaging in this ecosystem. as we said in the last congress, mr. speaker, these rules need to be fit for purpose for the digital ecosystem. all of us on this house floor know that the status quo is simply unacceptable. we all know american consumers and innovators deserve this clarity. they deserve better. they deserve rules of the road. the choice before us is whether to lead in the financial markets of the future or watch the next ftx fail while we are left saying once again: well, we have been here before. mr. speaker, i urge all my colleagues to join me on both sides of the aisle and support the clarity act. let us fill these regulatory gaps with the proper federal oversight. let us create a competitive digital ecosystem. i support this bill, and i urge my colleagues to. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. waters. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, crypto week has been going so well, has not it? mr. speaker, that is because bailing out billionaires is hard work. i look at how hard republicans worked to strip healthcare from 17 million americans, shutter rural hospitals, and take food assistance from 12 million people just to hand the richest 1 percent of americans a tax break they do not need. no one should be surprised that the republicans' next order of business is a billion-dollar handout to the president himself. in just 6 months, president trump has enriched himself and his family to the tune of $1.2 billion, and that is just the beginning. president trump used to call crypto a scam. in 2021, trump said: ``bitcoin, it just seems like a scam . . . i do not like it because it is another currency competing against the dollar.'' melania was actually the first to get involved in the crypto ecosystem. in january 2022, she announced an auction of her non- fungible token, or nft, collection. trump then followed suit in december 2022, launching his own nft collection, ditching his concerns about crypto because he saw it as a way to pad his pockets. during the campaign trail, trump ramped up his crypto involvement. in september 2024, he and his family launched world liberty financial, a crypto trading platform. days before the inauguration, trump launched his memecoin which he later used to offer access to the white house to the highest bidder, foreign or domestic. his family's crypto empire has not stopped there. world liberty financial launched a stablecoin called usd1. [[page h3398]] shortly after that, the abu dhabi-backed investment firm, mgx, bought $2 billion worth of trump's coin to make an investment in binance. trump's family has also launched a bitcoin mining operation and multiple crypto exchange-traded funds, or etfs. all of this comes at the same time that the trump administration has taken away the independence of the financial regulators like the securities and exchange commission. he issued executive order 14255 which now requires all rules written by the financial regulators to be reviewed and approved by the white house budget office. this means this bill would hand over to the president the ability to write the rules he wants to advance his crypto operations. not only that, under the trump administration, the sec has said that memecoins, stablecoins, and bitcoin mining all do not fall under their oversight. can my colleagues imagine that? do these assets sound familiar? oh, yes, they do because these are all ventures that trump and his family are pursuing now with no oversight by wall street's cop on the beat--that is the sec. surely, each of my colleagues can see how this is a blatant conflict of interest. democrats do. it is why i introduced the stop trump and crypto act to ban the president, vice president, and all the members of congress from crypto corruption. if we do not ban elected officials, including the president or vice president, from this crypto corruption in h.r. 3633, each of us will be complicit. yet, even if we included language to stop the crypto con, this bill, which should be called the calamity act, is bad public policy. that is plain and simple. the bill would lead to increased investor harm, plant the seeds for the next financial crisis, and endanger our national security. just last week, the former chairman of the commodity futures trading commission warned that this bill would allow traditional companies, like apple or google, to evade securities laws. they could walk away from the disclosure, antifraud, liability, and corporate governance protections that investors have relied on for 90 years. the bill blocks our state regulators from protecting seniors against fraud in crypto. additionally, the calamity act does not address illicit finance and other crimes commonly seen in the crypto space. it does not provide nearly enough direction to agencies, which would be required to match the level of financial crimes and noncompliance seen in the industry. it also does not provide sufficient funds for federal agencies to examine and enforce these laws. mr. speaker, for all of these reasons, i strongly, strongly oppose this bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. hill of arkansas. mr. speaker, i include in the record the cbo estimate for this bill.

and $500,000. cbo has not completed an estimate of the effects of the bill on spending subject to appropriation. basis of estimate: for this estimate, cbo assumes that the legislation will be enacted in summer 2025. direct spending: the bill would require the commodity futures trading commission (cftc) to share information that it collects from digital commodity exchanges with the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic), the financial stability oversight council (fsoc), the national credit union administration (ncua), and the office of the comptroller of the currency (occ), upon request. the bill also would require those agencies to regulate additional entities that are subject to federal anti-money-laundering rules and to issue regulations that set capital requirements for agreements that combine multiple financial transactions. the expenditures of the fdic, fsoc, ncua, and occ are classified in the budget as direct spending. both the ncua and the occ collect fees from financial institutions to offset their operating costs; those fees are recorded in the budget as offsetting receipts (that is, as reductions in direct spending). after accounting for fees collected by the ncua and occ, cbo estimates that, on net, enacting h.r. 3633 would increase direct spending for those four agencies by $11 million over the 2025-2035 period. revenues: h.r. 3633 would require the cftc to share information with the federal reserve upon request. the bill also would direct the federal reserve to regulate additional entities that are subject to federal anti-money-laundering regulations and to issue rules for the capital requirements described above. cbo estimates that those activities would cost the federal reserve $7 million over the 2025-2035 period. costs incurred by the federal reserve reduce remittances, which are recorded in the budget as revenues. changes in costs for the federal reserve banks have historically resulted in changes to remittances during the same year. however, since fiscal year 2023, the central bank has recorded a deferred asset to account for accrued net losses from expenses in excess of income. as a result, remittances largely have been suspended. in cbo's projections, remittances from the federal reserve will generally be suspended until 2030, and until they resume, most changes in costs incurred by the system will not be recorded as changes in remittances. the fsoc is authorized to assess fees on bank holding companies and nonbank financial institutions; those fees are recorded in the budget as revenues. cbo estimates that under the bill the fsoc would collect $3 million in additional fees over the 2025-2035 period to cover operating costs. finally, section 315 would reduce the size of the federal reserve's surplus fund. cbo estimates that enacting that provision would increase remittances to the treasury by $15 million in 2035. cbo estimates that enacting h.r. 3633 would increase revenues by $11 million, on net, over the 2025-2035 period. spending subject to appropriation: in addition to effects on direct spending and revenues as noted in the table, the bill also contains provisions that would affect spending subject to appropriation. cbo has not estimated those effects. uncertainty: cbo did not estimate any budgetary effects arising from changes to the banking system or financial markets as a result of enacting h.r. 3633. depending on their individual design and extent of adoption, virtual currencies could enhance the efficiency of the system, cause disruption, or reduce bank deposits. those effects are uncertain and, given their potential range, cbo cannot currently estimate their direction or magnitude. increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: cbo estimates that enacting h.r. 3633 would not increase net direct spending by more than $2.5 billion in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036. cbo estimates that enacting h.r. 3633 would not increase on-budget deficits by more than $5 billion in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036. mandates: h.r. 3633 would impose private-sector and intergovernmental mandates as defined in the unfunded mandates reform act (umra). cbo estimates that the cost of the mandates would exceed the private- sector threshold but fall below the intergovernmental threshold established in umra ($206 million and $103 million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation). private-sector mandates: the bill would impose regulatory requirements on some entities involved in digital commodities and assets, such as large multinational businesses with market capitalizations in the hundreds of billions of dollars and with millions of u.s. consumers. using publicly available information and information from industry sources, cbo estimates that the aggregate cost of the mandate would greatly exceed the private-sector threshold established in umra. in addition, if federal financial regulators increase fees to offset the costs associated [[page h3399]] with implementing the bill, h.r. 3633 would increase the cost of an existing mandate on private entities required to pay those assessments. cbo estimates that the annual cost of the mandate would be in the millions of dollars. intergovernmental mandates: the bill would expand existing preemptions of state laws governing the registration of digital assets as securities. although it would limit the application of state laws, h.r. 3633 would impose no duty on states that would result in additional spending or loss of revenue. phillip l. swagel, director, congressional budget office. mr. hill of arkansas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. steil). mr. speaker, the gentleman is an essential leader in our committee and also the chairman of our subcommittee on digital assets, financial technology, and artificial intelligence. mr. steil. mr. speaker, i thank chairman hill for all of his hard work on this. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of the clarity act. i think two things are clear. first, the digital asset and blockchain technology are leading the next wave of financial innovation. we need to make sure that innovation is occurring here in the united states of america. second, under the previous administration, the united states failed to enact a regulatory framework that is aligned with the realities of the technology and adequately protects consumers. today, the house has an opportunity to meaningfully improve the status quo that for too long has been marred by uncertainty and regulatory enforcement. the clarity act establishes a workable, forward-looking framework. the clarity act provides and ensures that markets operate with transparency, accountability, and strong consumer protections. today, our laws leave digital asset developers guessing which regulator has jurisdiction and what compliance even looks like. {time} 0940 it is not only bad for business. it is bad for consumers and bad for u.s. competitiveness. without action, we will continue to see innovation move overseas to jurisdictions that are providing the legal clarity that we thus far in the united states have failed to deliver. mr. speaker, what we want is innovation in developing, not occurring in boardrooms and law firms in the united states, but in basements and dorm rooms. ensuring the united states leads the web3 revolution is not a partisan issue. it is an american issue. the clarity act legislates in a thoughtful way in a rapidly evolving space. the clarity act protects consumers and fosters innovation. today, we can lead not by accident but by design. let us send a message that america intends to lead in the golden age of digital assets. mr. speaker, i support the clarity act, and i encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' ms. waters. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. lynch), who is also the ranking member of the subcommittee on digital assets, financial technology, and artificial intelligence. mr. lynch. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman from california for her leadership on this issue. i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 3633, the so-called clarity act. i believe this misguided legislation will have devastating impacts on our financial stability, national security, and investor protection. while my republican friends claim that this bill will regulate crypto market structure, in reality, it eviscerates the longstanding history of investor protections that have made our markets the envy of the world. most importantly, this bill, this push for crypto, will not end well for the u.s. taxpayer. this bill will lead to the next financial crisis, and the largest crypto donors who wrote this bill will walk away unharmed because the worst aspect of this bill is that republicans have repeatedly refused to include a single amendment preventing a federal taxpayer bailout of the crypto industry. that is what this bill does. additionally, this bill includes zero provisions to prevent the president, who has a $620-million conflict of interest, from continuing his ability to accept emoluments from foreign governments like abu dhabi. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and protect the american taxpayer. mr. hill of arkansas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from minnesota (mr. emmer), who is our majority whip and who has been an absolute, essential early focus policymaker in the digital asset space. mr. emmer. mr. speaker, the united states stands at the forefront of the next digital renaissance, a transformative shift toward a decentralized peer-to-peer digital economy. for many years, innovators and investors were forced to operate in a legal gray zone while agencies jostled for regulatory superiority over the digital asset ecosystem, leaving blockchain developers to pack up and move abroad. the clarity act fixes this by creating regulatory guardrails tailored to the unique attributes of blockchain technology while giving users and developers the confidence to engage and innovate in this ecosystem. gone are the days of arbitrary enforcement actions and regulatory turf wars that only hindered the development of this groundbreaking technology and drove capital overseas. this bill gives market participants the confidence to build, invest, and grow right here in the united states of america. we are proud to have the securities clarity act included in this legislation. this provision provides market certainty for innovators and clear jurisdictional boundaries for regulators. subsequently, elements of the blockchain regulatory certainty act were included, clarifying, once and for all, that digital asset developers and service providers who do not custody consumer funds are not considered money transmitters. importantly, the clarity act will help further decentralize our financial system so that americans can forgo intermediaries and transact directly with each other. having this choice will fundamentally transform the digital economy and unlock new opportunities for innovators, investors, and consumers around the globe. mr. speaker, i thank chairman hill and chairman thompson for their leadership and for working with us to include our two bills in the clarity act. the united states has the opportunity to lead and deliver on president trump's promise to make america the crypto capital of the world. we cannot and will not fail. ms. waters. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from illinois (mr. casten), who is also the vice ranking member of the financial services committee. mr. casten. mr. speaker, the only thing you need to know about the clarity act is that it is designed to destroy u.s. capital markets. u.s. capital markets are the envy of the world because investors like putting their money in them. they are the envy of the world because we provide robust investor protections when people put their money in them, because of the securities and exchange commission. yet, the clarity act would allow companies to raise up to $200 million over 4 years without any disclosure and without any transparency, just by tokenizing their security. let us be clear. putting a security on the blockchain does not make investors safe. it might make money for the crypto industry. mr. speaker, i know you all like that. it might make it possible for the companies to temporarily raise more money from dumb investors because they do not get that protection. if we stop protecting investors, then why would investors put their money in the stock market? they will abandon the u.s. to go to places with a better risk-reward. i understand we have a lot of fraud and grift in the white house. i understand republicans are big fans of fraud and grift in the white house, but we do not need any more. let us protect americans' hard-earned savings. let us protect markets and not just make crypto bros richer. i urge a resounding hell no. mr. hill of arkansas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from michigan (mr. huizenga), who is the [[page h3400]] vice chairman of our full committee and who is a longtime advocate for reform in the digital markets. mr. huizenga. mr. speaker, i appreciate those remarks from the chair. the digital asset ecosystem currently operates in a fragmented regulatory environment that lends itself to significant challenges for both businesses and, more importantly, investors. the ambiguity in classifying a digital asset, either as a security or a commodity, has led to confusion, legal uncertainty, and, ultimately, consumer harm. american innovation is a critical element in job creation and economic opportunity here in the united states. congress must look to preserve this competitive advantage and not let it leave our shores. by passing a comprehensive market structure framework, responsible actors will now have greater certainty and consumers greater protection from bad actors. this bill establishes a regulatory framework for digital assets that aligns with our existing financial markets while accounting for the unique characteristics of digital assets. mr. speaker, our markets are the envy of the world. american innovation is a critical element of job creation and economic opportunity here in the united states. congress must not cede its responsibility. mr. speaker, i urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. ms. waters. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. sherman), who is also the ranking member of the subcommittee on capital markets. mr. sherman. mr. speaker, i submitted many amendments to rules, as did other democrats. they made only one in order. i will not be offering it because in the absence of the other amendments, it is really not useful. this bill is an attack on working families, which is why the afl-cio says no, and they are scoring it. this bill prohibits congress members from sponsoring cryptocurrencies because of the obvious corruption and conflict of interest, but it allows the president to create electronic monopoly money. who is buying? abu dhabi is buying $2 billion of trump stablecoin while the chinese interests behind tiktok are buying $300 million worth of trump coin, and that is just what we know about. there is a lot we do not know about because cryptocurrency literally means hidden money. it allows for bailouts under section 13(3) of the federal reserve act. jay powell will not do it, but the next guy will. congress will not stop him because crypto spends more in super-pac than any other industry by far, five times more than the combination of big oil and big pharma. it allows for the purchase of bitcoin and trump coin, and trump has announced that he is going to do just that with our tax dollars going into his crypto. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. ms. waters. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from california. mr. sherman. finally, this creates the perfect financial tool for drug dealers and for tax evaders because every time a billionaire cheats on his taxes, a member of the freedom caucus earns his wings. mr. hill of arkansas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ohio (mr. davidson), who is the chairman of our subcommittee on national security, illicit finance, and international financial institutions and a longtime policy advocate for reform in our digital markets. {time} 0950 mr. davidson. mr. speaker, the ability to move payment or digital tokens that represent other assets person to person, without a third party or intermediary, across any space digitally at the speed of light is part of the reason this industry was created. what do those tokens represent? either securities, commodities or real world assets? we have needed a bright-line test since this market began to decide who regulates them. i introduced the first piece of legislation on this back in 2018 called the token taxonomy act. think of the harm that could have been prevented if we had that bright-line test all this time. the other essential component is self-custody, the ability to control your own assets. you cannot go person to person if you have to go through an intermediary without a permission. it does that. it does just what we need it to do, just like cash. we finally have market structure in place with this bill. i hope the senate delivers the same structure soon, and we get the certainty the markets need. ms. waters. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from new york (ms. velazquez), who is also the ranking member of the small business committee. ms. velazquez. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong opposition to this bill. it is ironic we are debating a bill called the clarity act when it offers no clarity on one of the biggest issues in crypto, the blatant conflicts of interest inside our own government. since returning to office, president trump has turned the presidency into a crypto cash machine. it is now estimated that crypto makes up the majority of donald trump's net worth. foreign investors, some under federal investigation, are pouring millions into these ventures, buying access, influence, and favorable treatment. so i ask: what are we doing here? with this bill, not only are we continuing to allow president trump to issue his cryptocurrency, but we are allowing him and his cronies to be in charge of the regulators overseeing that venture and compromising the stability of capital markets in our country. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' mr. hill of arkansas. mr. speaker, may i inquire as to the time remaining. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from arkansas has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. hill of arkansas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from nebraska (mr. flood), the chair of our subcommittee on housing and insurance. mr. flood. mr. speaker, i will be brief. it has been a longer wait than expected, but i am excited that the clarity act has finally made it to the house floor for debate. the clarity act is not just about digital assets like bitcoin. this bill will usher in a new age of blockchain innovation that will go well beyond the tokens that we know well today. chris dixon's book titled: ``read write own'' talks about a future where blockchain technology enables a new generation of the internet which he terms ``web 3.0.'' technologies like nfts can be used as tickets to events, identity verification tools, and serve other real-world uses that will change our digital economy. i urge my colleagues to see the bigger picture. the vote today is not just about cryptocurrency as we know it. it is about enabling the next generation of innovation enabled by blockchain. this is a good, bipartisan product that builds on years of work from chairman hill, subcommittee chairman steil, the financial services committee, and the agriculture committee. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support the bill. ms. waters. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from illinois (mr. foster), who is also the ranking member of the subcommittee on financial institutions. mr. foster. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to the clarity act, which claims to bring digital assets under a regulatory umbrella but fails in two major areas. first, it fails because it has no kyc--know your customer-- requirements for self-hosted wallets. it allows anonymous trading on defi exchanges and the dark web, which means there is no way to prevent wash trading, front running, corruption, ransomware, extortion and kidnapping payoffs, and all the parade of horribles that unregulated crypto has unleashed upon the world. this legislation simply applies a patina of regulation while codifying loopholes that leave large parts of the industry, including the president's own meme coin schemes, completely unregulated. [[page h3401]] secondly, the clarity act also lacks the basic investor protections present in the securities laws. for example, firms are not required to serve the best interests of their investors or to separate critical market functions and many other basic protections. now, i am not ideologically opposed to crypto, and both of these flaws are fixable, but in clarity they have not been fixed. mr. speaker, i oppose this bill, and i urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' mr. hill of arkansas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. fitzgerald). mr. fitzgerald. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of the bipartisan clarity act, commonsense legislation that finally gives digital asset markets the regulatory certainty they need to grow responsibly right here in the united states. for too long, innovators have been stuck in a regulatory gray zone caught between agencies and overlapping authority and subject to enforcement instead of clear rules. the uncertainty has driven jobs, investment, and innovation offshore while leaving american consumers exposed. the clarity act fixes this. it establishes clear, functional rules for digital assets, drawing a bright line between the sec and the cftc and creating strong, enforceable protections for consumers. it ensures the digital assets developers and consumer-facing firms play by the rules, disclosing who owns what, segregating customer funds, and avoiding conflicts of interest. it is long overdue, and i commend the chairmen for bringing this bill to the floor today. ms. waters. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from massachusetts (ms. pressley), an unapologetic leader for justice. ms. pressley. mr. speaker, i rise in vigorous opposition to the clarity act. this bill gives a green light to self-enriching crypto schemes where officials at the highest levels of power, including in the white house, have generated hundreds of billions of dollars in personal profit. we need legislation that stops financial abuse, not encourages it, especially during a time when the sec has dropped enforcement actions against major crypto firms and undermined investor safety. across our country, millions of working families are battling rising costs, our elders are targeted by financial scams, and investors are trying to recover from volatile markets. republicans are ignoring all of that to prioritize the crypto industry's wish list. to be clear, the people deserve crypto legislation that is fair, transparent, and accountable, not a bill that opens the floodgates to conflicts of interest and weakens investor protections. the clarity act fails that test. republicans need some clarity all right: moral and legislative. i agree with ranking member waters that this is really the calamity act. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. mr. hill of arkansas. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. we are here today, mr. speaker, because of the exceptional work by the house financial services committee over a 5-year period, including under the leadership of then-chairwoman maxine waters and former chairman patrick mchenry, gathering feedback from experts, looking at market participants, analyzing the markets, and talking to regulators. that is how we got the clarity act on the floor today. it is built on the backs of that hard work. this chamber passed a similar bill in the last congress with exceedingly strong, bipartisan support. since then, the clarity act has only been further refined and strengthened in terms of legal certainty and consumer protection. this bill, mr. speaker, as we have demonstrated over that period of time, would prevent consumer harm like ftx. mr. speaker, i support the bill. i urge my colleagues to support the bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. waters. mr. speaker, may i inquire as to the time remaining. the speaker pro tempore. the gentlewoman from california has 2 minutes remaining. ms. waters. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california (ms. kamlager-dove). {time} 1000 ms. kamlager-dove. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to the so-called clarity act. let me be clear: i support the growth of digital assets, blockchain innovation, and the promise that crypto holds for expanding financial access and economic justice, but this bill is not clarity. it is confusion cloaked in legislation. it picks winners and losers, and the biggest winner is the president of the united states. why is that office exempt from all of the rules? it undermines the sec's ability to protect consumers and fast-tracks deregulatory loopholes without addressing core issues like transparency, fraud prevention, or equity and access. the sec does not even like this bill. we need comprehensive, thoughtful regulation, not rushed frameworks driven by the people who will gain the most who ignore the voices of everyday investors, builders, and communities left behind. crypto deserves rules that are smart, fair, and future-facing. the clarity act is none of these things because, if it was, republicans would have had the votes much earlier. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' ms. waters. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, let me reiterate: a vote for h.r. 3633 is a vote to give trump the pen to write the rules that would put more money into his family's pockets. a vote for h.r. 3633 is a vote for increased investor harm. a vote for h.r. 3633 is a vote to plant the seeds for the next financial crisis. a vote for h.r. 3633 is a vote to endanger our national security. that is why i am voting ``no'' on h.r. 3633, the calamity act, and i urge all members to not give a vote to trump to own crypto and not to give a vote to the vice president. they are the only two elected officials in this bill who can own crypto businesses. i want to see all of the cabinet, the president, the vice president, and all members of congress unable to own crypto businesses. mr. speaker, i urge all members to vote no, no, no, on this bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. all time for financial services debate has expired. the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. thompson) and the gentlewoman from minnesota (ms. craig) each will control 15 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from pennsylvania. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i am incredibly proud today to stand before you to share my support for the clarity act. this is legislation that we have been working on in the agriculture committee for 7 years. this is an improvement over the legislation that fulfilled the very same purpose of what we are addressing today that passed last congress with over 300 votes, including 71 democrats, and it was a great bipartisan bill. this is an improvement on that bill. the clarity act is about three related ideas: certainty, protection, and innovation. i will talk about why each of these ideas is important. first, the clarity act provides regulatory certainty for all corners of the digital asset ecosystem, including issuers; exchanges; intermediaries; builders; software developers; and, most importantly, users of digital assets. this regulatory certainty means that all parts of the ecosystem can engage with digital assets with confidence. it promotes healthy markets by establishing commonsense requirements to protect consumers. those are all built on the existing requirements in the financial services markets. secondly, the clarity act protects good actors from government overreach. by establishing clear rules, we limit the government's ability to subjectively enforce vague statutes. these protections are important to those entities like exchanges, brokers, and dealers, who we require to register. yet, in many cases, they are more important to entities which congress is not seeking to register. [[page h3402]] third, and most importantly, the clarity act supports innovation across the economy, not just the crypto economy. at the house agriculture committee, we heard testimony from numerous stakeholders about innovative ways in which developers and entrepreneurs are leveraging blockchain to build projects and services using blockchains and digital assets. the certainty and protections provided through the clarity act will lead to the development of a new generation of services, tools, and systems. i am excited for that future to happen here in the united states of america. mr. speaker, congress has a historic opportunity here today to act. with the clarity act, we can pass legislation that protects consumers and ensures that the united states remains at the forefront of technological innovation. these are not mutually exclusive goals. they are mutually reinforcing goals. by supporting the clarity act, we can create a safer, more transparent, and more accessible environment for digital assets. mr. speaker, i urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. craig. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today on behalf of nearly 44 million american consumers who have invested in, traded, or used digital assets. that is one in five americans. the public interest in these markets is already here, and it is not going away. under the status quo, there is a gap in regulation for the digital commodity asset market. our work here today could begin to provide the protections that american investors are accustomed to in traditional financial markets that are regulated by the cftc. regardless of whether congress acts, these markets will continue to grow. the only question is whether we will begin the hard work of developing regulation or refuse to begin. the clarity act would put consumer protections in place for the first time for this industry. consumers will finally be protected by the same sort of guardrails that protect investors in other sectors of the economy: segregation of customer deposits, consumer disclosures, mandatory recordkeeping, and examination by regulators. we do not want another ftx. the 2022 collapse of the world's third largest cryptocurrency exchange wiped out an estimated $8 billion to $10 billion in value, leaving american consumers holding the bag. the clarity act would have largely mitigated or avoided this crisis entirely. former biden administration cftc chairman russ behnam testified yesterday before the senate agriculture committee: `` . . . inaction will only result in greater risk to our financial markets and investors, through lack of market transparency, fraud, market manipulation, corruption, and conflicts of interest.'' that is lack of action. mr. speaker, let me address the elephant in the room: the first family's involvement with digital assets and personally profiting from them. it has rightfully raised questions of impropriety and alarmed government ethics watchdogs. the first family's personal financial involvement in other sectors, such as telecoms, should ring alarm bells, as well, loud and clear as it comes to ethics in our country. there is a time and place for holding the powerful accountable, and that must happen. we should address executive branch corruption independently, and it should apply to all sectors. today, we must focus on regulation and protections for consumers because, today, one in five americans, and growing, lack those protections and lack any guardrails. it is our job to start putting them in place. is this bill perfect? no. can it be improved upon? absolutely, and i encourage my senate colleagues to keep working on those outstanding issues. this bill deserves our support, and i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i was remiss with my opening comments not to thank my agriculture committee partner, ranking member angie craig, for her leadership and for working together with me on this issue, but also our financial services committee chair french hill; my good friend, don davis; whip emmer; bryan steil, and so many more. there was just such a strong bipartisan leadership partner team. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from iowa (mr. feenstra), a member of the house agriculture committee. mr. feenstra. mr. speaker, i thank chairman thompson for bringing this bill forward. it is an amazing bill. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of the clarity act. the increasing adoption of digital assets and the use of blockchain technologies can grow our economy and provide american families with a new opportunity to grow wealth. {time} 1010 however, under president biden, digital assets were attacked, which crushed innovation and created uncertainty for businesses. fortunately, president trump is working to make america the crypto capital of the world. we want digital asset innovation to happen in america and crypto jobs to be created in america without ceding ground to foreign countries. that is why we must pass the clarity act, to spur innovation and support economic growth by providing clear rules of the road for digital assets in the united states. this bill establishes clear roles for the sec and cftc, which prevents agencies from overreach and confusion. it provides consumer protections through greater transparency and accountability in the marketplace. it fosters innovation by providing a pathway for digital asset firms to operate legally and with confidence, encouraging digital asset innovation to remain in the u.s. the clarity act unlocks economic growth, global competitiveness, and financial opportunity for all. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this bill and put america first in the race to lead the global digital asset marketplace for our country. ms. craig. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. davis), my distinguished colleague and the ranking member of the house agriculture subcommittee on commodity markets, digital assets, and rural development. mr. davis of north carolina. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 3633, known as the clarity act. i am honored to serve as a co-lead on this legislation, alongside chairman thompson, chairman hill, ranking member craig, subcommittee chair johnson, and so many others who came to the table in good faith to get this done. let me also take a moment to thank the staff, both the majority and the minority staff. they put in so many hours working on this. i know i was up late one night. it was probably midnight. i really commend the team. they helped work on a very complex issue here that is before us and to help shape a bipartisan product that reflects the seriousness of the moment. this bill reflects compromise, collaboration, and months of work to craft the regulatory framework that meets the moment, because the truth is, we cannot afford to fall behind. right now we are at a crossroad. the digital asset industry is growing, evolving, changing the way people around the world engage with financial markets and emerging technologies. without a clear regulatory structure in place, we are seeing innovation move overseas not because our talent is not here, but because the rules are not here. the clarity act provides us with an opportunity then to change that, to lead, to establish thoughtful and balanced guardrails that support innovation, protect consumers, and foster confidence in our markets. you see disclosures and reports dealing with so many provisions, antifraud, manipulation. you cannot commingle funds. but let me be clear: the bill is not perfect. i have been vocal about that, too. i remain concerned about the absence of meaningful conflict-of- interest provisions dealing with the executive branch. it does not matter who occupies the white house. the bottom line is, [[page h3403]] whoever is in the white house, we need clear standards that ensure public trust is never compromised. i also remain concerned about adequate resources for the cftc. yes, i acknowledge this bill provides more flexibility to deal with hiring, but we also need to see more resources because we are asking the cftc to take on a major role here. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. ms. craig. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from north carolina. mr. davis of north carolina. in the 118th congress, we passed fit21 with overwhelming bipartisan support. the clarity act builds on this work. let us pass the clarity act and send a strong message to the american people and the world that the united states will lead in building a forward-looking digital economy. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from iowa (mr. nunn), a member of the commodity markets, digital assets, and rural development subcommittee. mr. nunn of iowa. mr. speaker, i thank chairman thompson, as well as ranking member craig for leading a truly bipartisan opportunity to help america deliver as a crypto capital for the entire planet. as a member of both the agriculture committee and the financial services committee, i have been able to see this issue on both sides: commodities versus securities, cftc versus the sec. in my home state of rural iowa, we know commodities: corn, soybeans, hogs. the cftc does this very well. in downtown des moines and on the main streets of hometowns across iowa, our banks handle stocks and bonds, securities, those handled by the sec. that level of clarity works, but when it comes to digital assets, the lines become blurred, confused, and overly burdensome. that regulatory uncertainty does not just cost dollars. it costs jobs, innovation, and america's global leadership. the clarity act is exactly what america needs now to drive toward the future to ensure the next generation of financial internet technology and blockchain success is built in america, that our innovators come from the u.s., and that we have a future going forward. mr. speaker, i endorse the clarity act. ms. craig. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from michigan (ms. mcdonald rivet), my distinguished colleague who serves on the house agriculture subcommittee on commodity markets, digital assets, and rural development. ms. mcdonald rivet. mr. speaker, i rise today to voice support for the clarity act. while there is still work to be done, it is an important step in providing crucial and clear regulatory framework to the crypto industry. let us break it down. today, one in six u.s. adults, 17 percent of the population, are invested in or use cryptocurrency. that is 55 million americans. there is more than $3 trillion invested in the industry. it is dangerous and irresponsible that a market of this size and scope is currently operating without a clear regulatory framework. for consumers, innovators, and the stability of our nation's economy, the clarity act is an important first step forward. it protects consumers and equips assigned agencies with the appropriate authority to provide efficient and thorough oversight over digital asset markets. it also provides desperately needed certainty so that businesses can grow and evolve. i will be clear: if the clarity act had been in place, the ftx market crash that caused their customers to lose $8 billion would not have happened. this bill strengthens our national security by giving regulators the tools they need to track cross-border transactions and stop digital assets from being used to evade sanctions or fund our adversaries. the bill is not perfect, and it does not resolve every issue. like many of my colleagues, i am deeply concerned about the trump family's potential conflicts of interest in using crypto to profit from the office of the presidency. that is why i voted for amendments to impose guardrails to stop elected officials from improperly profiting off trades, and i will continue to push strongly for solutions to this problem. however, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. we stand at a critical moment where market structure is critical for our consumers, economy, and security, and the clarity act moves us meaningfully forward. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i will expand for a minute on the important protections included in the clarity act. the clarity act includes strong protections for the developers of software. sections 309 and 409 make it clear that neither the cftc nor the sec have the authority to require a person to register just because that person is developing, publishing, or distributing software. this is a critical protection, rooted in our first amendment, that should be read expansively by the commissions. {time} 1020 the creation of new decentralized finance protocols is also an important development that the clarity act seeks to protect. both the cftc and the sec must carefully examine and understand defi, which is why we are requiring both commissions to undertake a robust study on the unique benefits and risks of defi. through the clarity act, congress is making an unambiguous statement that defi is different, and it should be treated differently from the centralized custodial intermediaries. protecting this emerging technology is an essential purpose of the clarity act. now, mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from indiana (mr. messmer), a member of the committee on agriculture and a member of the commodity markets, digital assets, and rural development subcommittee. mr. messmer. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of the clarity act. america's innovative ecosystem has made our nation an investment magnet and development hub, but thus far, our regulatory system has failed the digital assets industry. under the current framework, fraudsters go unpunished, consumers remain unprotected, and the best and brightest minds in the industry have picked up and left for other countries. the clarity act finally establishes distinct jurisdictional boundaries between the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission, while also creating guardrails to incentivize and safeguard investment. the bill not only expands opportunities for wall street and silicon valley, but it also provides great opportunities for hoosier farmers by opening a new frontier for rural innovators and expanding access to capital in agricultural communities. the digital asset markets are in dire need of regulation, and the clarity act is the solution. i look forward to witnessing a new era of economic prosperity and technological advancement that this bill will bring to america. ms. craig. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from alabama (mr. figures), my distinguished colleague. mr. figures. mr. speaker, i have listened to many of my colleagues' views on the issues before us today. i respect them all, and i respect their views. i do not disagree with many of the points that my colleagues who are in opposition are making, especially as it relates to executive conflict of interest concerns. here is what i know. i know that the united states is lagging behind the rest of the world in regulating this industry. i know that the regulations in the clarity act are better than none at all in this industry. i know that consumers will be better protected the day after this goes into effect than they were the day before. now, is there more work to be done? absolutely. we should do that. we cannot allow subjective ideas of perfection to override what are objectively steps in the right direction. the clarity act is one act that i support, and this is an important first step. as we move forward, however, we must continue to make the necessary investments so that everyone can participate. those are investments in technical training and education so that people have the knowledge and [[page h3404]] skills to actually understand and participate in a digital economy. this is also a time to commit ourselves to ensuring that we do not leave underserved and rural communities behind. i represent a district that is geographically predominantly rural. we still struggle with issues like not having access to the internet in many counties that i represent. you cannot participate in or leverage the benefits of a digital economy if you cannot get on the internet. that is a fact. we must stand up for these communities and bring broadband and internet expansion resources to every community that we possibly can. let us keep moving forward. let us keep making sure that we are bringing everyone along with us. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this bill. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman who just spoke for his remarks concerning the need for high-speed broadband. my pledge, as the chairman of the committee on agriculture, is that when we are back in september, we will have farm bill 2.0, which includes rural economic development and rural broadband. we have to get that done. i yield to the gentleman from georgia (mr. carter), a cosponsor of the clarity act, for 1 minute. mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i rise today to voice my support for the clarity act. the clarity act is a bill that will make clear laws to help better regulate digital assets and blockchain technology. this bill will ensure that future innovations in the financial world will happen here in the united states and not in foreign countries. we cannot allow our adversaries, such as china, to control the digital economy. the clarity act will help modernize financial laws to make innovation possible and clear up many opaque and sometimes contradictory laws. this bill delivers on president trump's commitment to make the united states the crypto capital of the world, and i am proud that we are paving the path toward american dominance in the digital future. today, i again would like to give my support for the clarity act, as it cements america as a hub for the world's financial innovation. ms. craig. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. gottheimer), my distinguished colleague who serves on the house financial services committee. mr. gottheimer. mr. speaker, i thank chairwoman craig for her excellent leadership. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the bipartisan clarity act. this bill was made possible through a bipartisan effort that i was very proud to help lead with chairman hill and congressman steil. it is an important one because one-fifth of americans own crypto. my state, new jersey, proportionally ranks second nationwide in ownership of cryptocurrency. while cryptocurrency has tremendous economic potential, we desperately need rules of the road to protect consumers, ensure the success of american entrepreneurs, and ensure that america leads the way, not other nations around the world, but that america leads the way in this growing space. the clarity act takes commonsense steps to make crypto work for everyday users, including measures to stop snake oil salesmen, fraudsters, and hucksters, and puts the trump family's coins under regulation. this legislation supports american-led innovation by encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build, invest, and create jobs in our country. finally, this bill gives clarity to the sec's and cftc's roles in crypto to work together efficiently and to crack down on scammers and criminal activity. after years of uncertainty, it finally says who should oversee what, so that people in this space understand the direction it is going in and understand who is going to oversee what, so that consumers can be protected. i cannot say that enough. do we want this to continue to be the wild west with uncertainty, or do we want to have clear rules of the road to protect consumers? do we want to do something or nothing? is it perfect? as you have heard today, no, it is not perfect. few pieces of legislation we bring here are. the questions are: will it do good? will it make sure that we look after people who are involved in this space? will it ensure that america succeeds and grows? those are the questions. to do nothing means that we will ensure that trump's coin has no oversight. why would we want that? we will ensure that no consumer is protected if we do nothing. we want to protect american consumers. that is our job. this legislation does that. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this critical commonsense, bipartisan legislation. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, may i ask how much time is remaining. the speaker pro tempore (mr. murphy). the gentleman from pennsylvania has 5\1/2\ minutes remaining. the gentlewoman from minnesota has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from tennessee (mr. rose), the vice chair of the commodity markets, digital assets, and rural development subcommittee and also a member of the house financial services committee. he is a very busy man. mr. rose. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the clarity act, which provides long-overdue updates aimed at protecting the future of digital assets, encouraging growth, and protecting american consumers. the days of stifling this emerging industry through litigation and rogue rulemaking must end. the securities and exchange commission under former chair gary gensler went far outside the agency's statutory mandate in many ways, especially with cryptocurrencies. the clarity act will strengthen transparency and accountability for consumers. it will require developers to provide accurate disclosures with details about the asset project's operation, ownership, and structure. it requires brokers and dealers to disclose important information to investors, to hold their own funds separate from their customers' funds, and to report any conflicts of interest. this bill ensures americans know where they are putting their money, and it gets government out of the way of growth and innovation. let us pass the clarity act for the good of this country. {time} 1030 ms. craig. mr. speaker, i have no other speakers at the moment. i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from south dakota (mr. johnson), the chairman of the commodity markets, digital assets, and rural development subcommittee. mr. johnson of south dakota. mr. speaker, it has been such an honor to work with g.t., french, angie, don, brian, and so many others on something that is real. it is sometimes hard to separate the real from the fake in this town. that is certainly true for digital assets, nfts, and memecoins. these generate tremendous attention, and they can pull our gaze away from what really matters. here is what matters: blockchain technology, web3, will transform every single industry in the same way that the internet has transformed every single industry over the last 30 years. that transformation will happen much faster than people realize if we can keep government from continuing to screw this up. this is not about buying bubble gum with bitcoin. this is about blockchain innovation happening here rather than overseas, about more liquid capital markets, about small businesses creating new services and products, about removing friction from transactions for every single american, and about protecting consumers so the debacles like the ftx meltdown never happen again. we tend to overstate the impact of what we do in this town. everything is historic, even when it is not. however, this is different. this is huge. before i came to congress, i was in the broadband industry, and the telecommunications act of 1996 provided the regulatory certainty needed to launch the internet era. that was a watershed victory for this country. mr. speaker, we are here again. [[page h3405]] the regulatory certainty provided by this incredible bipartisan work product will launch a golden age of innovation and the golden age of digital assets. today, now, this moment, this is a watershed victory for this country. today we do something real. ms. craig. mr. speaker, i am prepared to close, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time for the purpose of closing. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from south dakota for his remarks and, quite frankly, i could not agree more. i also thank, again, my agriculture partner, ranking member angie craig with the agriculture committee, and don davis and our leadership and all those who have the foresight to see that this is about the future. well, it is about today because, you know, companies are struggling with this, but more importantly, it is about the future of both the financial sector and the technological sector. a vote for the clarity act is a vote for america's future and america's leadership. i urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the clarity act. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. craig. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time to close. mr. speaker, i, too, would like to thank the gentleman from pennsylvania, chairman g.t. thompson, and his team for working on this consumer protection legislation in a bipartisan manner. i believe bipartisan legislation is always preferable to partisan legislation. it is stronger. it is harder to undo when it has broad support and leadership changes overnight. i heard my chairman talk about the farm bill. i regret that it was not a bipartisan path through reconciliation for farm bill provisions, but i am optimistic that we can work together in many other areas. while i wait to see what the gentleman has in store for us for farm programs left behind, i, too, agree that rural development is incredibly important, mr. speaker. i hope that the bipartisanship shown through the clarity act process can act as a reminder that we accomplish more and we go further when we work together. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. all time for debate on the bill has expired. the chair understands that amendment no. 1 will not be offered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on passage of the bill. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. ms. craig. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________
