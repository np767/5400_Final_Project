[congressional record volume 163, number 119 (friday, july 14, 2017)] [house] [pages h5836-h5868] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2018 the speaker pro tempore (mr. bost). pursuant to house resolution 440 and rule xviii, the chair declares the house in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for the further consideration of the bill, h.r. 2810. will the gentleman from idaho (mr. simpson) kindly take the chair. {time} 0906 in the committee of the whole accordingly, the house resolved itself into the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for the further consideration of the bill (h.r. 2018) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the department of defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, with mr. simpson (acting chair) in the chair. the clerk read the title of the bill. the acting chair. when the committee of the whole house rose on thursday, july 13, 2017, a second set of amendments en bloc, offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. thornberry) had been disposed of. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 16 printed in house report 115-217. amendment no. 17 offered by mr. byrne the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 17 printed in house report 115-217. mr. byrne. mr. chairman, i rise as the designee of the gentlewoman from florida, and i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of title xxxv add the following: sec. __. application of law. section 4301 of title 46, united states code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(d) for purposes of any federal law except the federal water pollution control act (33 u.s.c. 1251 et seq.), any vessel, including a foreign vessel, being repaired or dismantled is deemed to be a recreational vessel, as defined under section 2101(25), during such repair or dismantling, if that vessel-- ``(1) shares elements of design and construction of traditional recreational vessels (as so defined); and ``(2) when operating is not normally engaged in a military, commercial, or traditionally commercial undertaking.''. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 440, the gentleman from alabama (mr. byrne) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from alabama. mr. byrne. mr. chairman, this straightforward and bipartisan amendment would provide important clarity for the recreational marine industry as it relates to workers' compensation coverage. for decades, federal law stated that individuals who build, dismantle, or repair recreational vessels less than 65 feet could be covered under state workers' compensation law instead of the federal longshore and harbor workers' compensation act. under the democrat-controlled congress in 2009, the law was simplified by eliminating the size limitation, which allowed more employers to purchase state workers' compensation. unfortunately, in 2011, the department of labor issued a burdensome and confusing rule creating a new definition of recreational vessel. this change contradicted legislation passed by the congress in 2009, and effectively denied recreational vessel repair workers access to more affordable state workers' compensation insurance. this regulatory confusion and uncertainty is reducing access to affordable workers' compensation policies and also hurting the overall recreational repair industry. our bipartisan amendment increases strong protections to ensure that no vessel used for commercial or military purposes is inappropriately excepted from the federal requirements. this amendment would provide regulatory relief for small businesses, including those in coastal alabama, while also ensuring the maritime workers receive the protections they need. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. courtney. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the amendment. the acting chair. the gentleman from connecticut is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. courtney. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to this amendment that is offered by my good friend from alabama (mr. byrne). i would just note that this is an amendment that has been around the last couple congresses, and the intent clearly is to carve out a larger exemption from the longshoremen's act which is a law that goes back to 1927. i would note that if that is the intent, the language of this amendment actually is kind of like legislating with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel because by carving out a larger exemption for recreational vessels above or beyond 55 feet long, basically there is a whole series of coast guard rules and regulations that have been enforced by the coast guard for many years that this amendment, unfortunately, is going to sweep up and undermine, including the rules related to alcohol on board vessels, waste management, coast guard inspection categories, vessel sales to non-u.s. citizens, tonnage taxes, and safety management systems. the coast guard is out there every single day making sure that these rules which really protect our ports and make sure that particularly foreign, large, super yachts are paying their fair share, in terms of the costs of environmental protection, and boating safety is enforced. that is, again, what this amendment will undermine. that is why last year the coast guard issued a statement pointing out the fact that because of the broad sweep of the language of this amendment, it is really undermining some key missions that the coast guard has been doing for decades for the american people. so i would note that, at the outset, obviously there is, i think, another [[page h5837]] issue which is just as significant which is undermining the longshoremen's act which goes back to calvin coolidge. it recognizes the fact that the folks who are engaged in longshoremen activity but also shipyard construction are engaged in a very high-risk type of occupation. the longshoremen's act was a recognition that state workers' compensation systems, because of the fact that they varied up and down in terms of protections, really required a federal minimum standard. that is really something that has obviously withstood the test of time over the last 90 years. again, if you look at the data, people who were involved in shipyard work, their risk of injury is much higher than many other occupations. i am a proud representative from a district that has the second largest employment level in shipbuilding according to the american shipbuilding association, and these folks are dealing with processes, equipment, and parts that, again, really are much higher risk than even aerospace or other forms of manufacturing. mr. chairman, i think what we ought to do is stick to the coast guard definition of what a recreational vessel is because that has been on the books for many years, and it is something that i think all of us should listen closely to in terms of evaluating this amendment. i think also we should recognize that we can build a great american shipbuilding sector in this country for commercial and recreational vessels, but we should not do it on the backs of worker protection. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. byrne. mr. chairman, i appreciate the gentleman. he and i have worked together on shipbuilding issues a lot of times, and i appreciate his leadership in that industry. these are recreational vessel companies. they are small companies doing small things on different types of vessels than the ones that mr. courtney and i are typically working together on. so trying to apply the same rules when it is a completely different activity to where, when we are usually talking about very large ships, it just does not make any sense. this has traditionally been a democrat amendment. i have always supported it. i am happy to be here to support it today. i would like for us to continue our tradition of bipartisanship on this issue. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. courtney. mr. chairman, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. scott) who is a colleague from another great shipbuilding district and also the ranking member of the education and the workforce committee. mr. scott of virginia. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to this amendment. the amendment shifts workers who repair super yachts and large, luxury watercraft out of coverage under the longshore and harbor workers' compensation act and into coverage under state workers' compensation programs. but it does not just amend the longshoremen act. rather, it creates a problem with the coast guard law. the coast guard opposed an identical amendment last year because it creates widespread damage to coast guard regulatory and enforcement authorities, implicates u.s. treaty obligations, and could affect the collection of tonnage taxes on foreign flagged vessels. the department of labor also opposes the amendment because it could lead to uncertainty and foster litigation under the longshoremen coverage. moreover, by shifting workers out of longshoremen into the weak state workers' comp laws such as florida, it could permanently impoverish workers. last year, the florida supreme court held that the florida workers' compensation law was so anemic that it was unconstitutional. if the goal is to provide reasonable insurance rates, then it should be in the insurance industry not by complicating the coast guard, by complicating the department of labor, and denying workers their benefits under the longshoremen's compensation act. mr. chairman, i include in the record a letter from the committee on education and the workforce opposing this amendment. committee on education and the workforce, house of representatives, washington, dc, july 12, 2017. re opposition to making amendment 302 in order as part of the national defense authorization act for fy 2018 (h.r. 2810) hon. pete sessions, chairman, committee on rules, house of representatives, washington, dc. hon. louise mcintosh slaughter, ranking member, committee on rules, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear chairman sessions and ranking member slaughter: i am writing to request that you not make amendment 302 in order as part of the rule for the fy 2018 national defense authorization act (h.r. 2810). the amendment offered by representatives frankel and byrne changes the definition of a ``recreational'' vessel under u.s. coast guard (uscg) boating safety authorizing legislation. the amendment authors' goal is to change workers' compensation coverage for those repairing luxury water craft and superyachts by shifting coverage for these workers from the longshore and harbor workers compensation act (lhwca) into state workers' compensation programs. however, the amendment does not amend the lhwca. rather it changes the definition of ``recreational vessel'' under section 4301 of title 46 (the federal boat safety act of 1971). according to the coast guard, this approach to amending the lhwca will have adverse collateral impacts on coast guard regulatory and enforcement authorities, implicate u.s. treaty obligations, and affect collection of tonnage taxes on foreign flagged vessels. the uscg statement, attached to this letter, notes that this provision could: exclude vessels now covered under the u.s. implementing legislation for the international convention on the control of harmful anti-fouling systems on ships, and reduce available civil monetary penalties to deter violations; allow a foreign vessel owner to exempt itself from tonnage taxes by declaring its vessel to be under repair; and, allow foreign flagged vessels to avoid requirements for safety management systems under the international safety management code. the u.s. department of labor (dol) objected to this provision in the last congress, as it would ``lead to uncertainty and foster litigation regarding longshore act coverage'' because the definition of ``recreational'' vessel introduces subjective criteria. this identical amendment was included in the house national defense authorization act for fy 2017 as section 3512, but was removed in the house-senate conference following the numerous objections raised by the u.s. coast guard and the u.s. department of labor. none of these concerns have been considered in hearings within the respective committees of jurisdiction for uscg or dol, and deserve careful consideration before being brought to a vote. i thank you for your consideration of this request. sincerely, robert c. bobby scott, ranking member. encl: u.s. coast guard views on amendment to the national defense authorization act (this set of views applied to the identical language included in amendment 302 that was adopted in section 3512 the fy 2017 national defense authorization act). coast guard views on sec. 3512 of h.r. 4909, the ndaa for fy17 the coast guard would oppose the previously referenced amendment to 46 u.s.c. sec. 4301. as a general matter, it seems like this proposed amendment is out of place. sec. 803 of the american investment and recovery act amended sec. 2(3)(f) of the longshore and harbor workers' compensation act (33 u.s.c. sec. 902(3)(f)), a statutory regime squarely within the purview of the department of labor (dol). indeed, in 2011, it was dol--not the coast guard--that promulgated the rule in question that, according to industry background documentation, would appear to be the root cause of this issue. thus, any changes to address this issue should be more properly directed either to the longshore and harbor workers' compensation act or to dol and its implementing regulations. aside from the amendment's misplaced statutory location, the proposed amendment contains numerous drafting issues. for example, the proposed amendment contains no limitation of the ``dismantling'' language to those activities ``in connection with the repair of such vessel.'' irrespective of the drafting issues, the proposed amendment would not provide any immediate relief as the draft language contains terms undefined by statute that prevent it from being self- executing. finally, if adopted, the amendment would likely create a wholly unnecessary bifurcated regulatory scheme between the dol regulations under 20 c.f.r. sec. sec. 701.501-701.505 and additional regulations promulgated by the coast guard. the proposed change to the definition of a ``recreational vessel'' to include ``any vessel, including a foreign vessel, being repaired or dismantled [. . .] during such repair or dismantling if the vessel (1) shares elements of [[page h5838]] design and construction of traditional recreational vessels (as so defined); and (2) when operating is not normally engaged in a military, commercial, or traditionally commercial undertaking'' has significant impacts on coast guard regulatory and enforcement authorities. the change in the definition would expand the current exclusion for ``recreational vessels'' from the u.s. implementing legislation for the international convention on the control of harmful anti-fouling systems on ships. specifically, civil penalties for owners of ``recreational vessels'' are statutorily limited to $5,000 as compared to the $37,500 maximum penalty for all other vessel owners. the change in the definition could be construed to allow a foreign vessel owner to exempt itself from tonnage taxes required under 46 u.s.c. sec. 60301, by claiming that its vessel is ``being repaired'' and thereby a recreational vessel exempted from tonnage taxes. the change in the definition could also be construed to allow foreign flagged vessels to avoid the requirements to maintain a safety management system onboard under 46 u.s.c. sec. 3201, et seq. by claiming that its vessel is ``being repaired'' and thereby a recreational vessel exempted from safety management requirements under the international safety management code. in addition to these statutory impacts, there are numerous coast guard regulations not related to longshoreman and harbor workers' compensation act authorities that would be impacted by the change. these include: 33 c.f.r. sec. 95.001 33 c.f.r. sec. 151.51 46 c.f.r. sec. 2.01-7 46 c.f.r. sec. 4.03-50 46 c.f.r. sec. 67.11 46 c.f.r. sec. 136.105 this list is by no means exhaustive. given the time for review, the coast guard has not been able to conduct a comprehensive review of statutory and regulatory impacts that would be implicated by this change. furthermore, as drafted, this change would require the coast guard to reallocate a substantial amount of financial and personnel resources to ensure that its regulations were in alignment with the revised definition. such an undertaking is wholly incompatible with the current fiscal climate. mr. scott of virginia. mr. chairman, i urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. mr. courtney. mr. chair, i yield back the balance of my time. {time} 0915 mr. byrne. mr. chairman, we have heard nothing from the coast guard this year in opposition to this amendment. in years past, i think the gentleman is correct, we have heard from them, but this year we have heard no opposition. in fact, a recreational vessel being repaired is the same as a recreational vessel being manufactured to use as a public vessel and should be treated the same in law. the coast guard already strictly enforces the existing laws and regulations that determine whether a vessel is recreational and enforces the law against those who would unlawfully use recreational vessels for commercial purposes. so i would suggest to the gentleman that this is not something the coast guard opposes. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from alabama (mr. byrne). the question was taken; and the acting chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. courtney. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the acting chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from alabama will be postponed. amendment no. 18 offered by mr. hunter the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 18 printed in house report 115-217. mr. hunter. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of title xxxv add the following: sec. __. recourse for non-u.s. seamen. section 57103 of title 46, united states code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(g) restriction.--(1) notwithstanding section 30104, a claim for damages or expenses relating to personal injury, illness, or death of a seaman who is a citizen of a foreign nation, arising during or from the engagement of the seaman by or for a passenger vessel duly registered under the laws of a foreign nation or a vessel identified as obsolete under subsection (a) or acquired under chapter 563, may not be brought under the laws of the united states if-- ``(a) such seaman was not a legal permanent resident of the united states at the time the claim arose; ``(b) the injury, illness, or death arose outside the territorial waters of the united states; and ``(c) the seaman or the seaman's personal representative has or had a right to seek compensation for the injury, illness, or death in, or under the laws of-- ``(i) the nation in which the vessel was registered at the time the claim arose; or ``(ii) the nation in which the seaman maintained citizenship or residency at the time the claim arose. ``(2) compensation defined.--as used in paragraph (1), the term `compensation' means-- ``(a) a statutory workers' compensation remedy that complies with standard a4.2 of regulation 4.2 of the maritime labour convention, 2006; or ``(b) in the absence of the remedy described in paragraph (1), a legal remedy that complies with standard a4.2 of regulation 4.2 of the maritime labour convention, 2006, that permits recovery for lost wages, pain and suffering, and future medical expenses.''. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 440, the gentleman from california (mr. hunter) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. mr. hunter. mr. chairman, this important amendment would help safeguard u.s. courts against crowding of court dockets by foreign maritime crewmembers. it simply clarifies where the claim must be brought when the case has no meaningful connection to the united states. specifically, the amendment limits the ability of foreign crewmembers working on foreign ships in foreign waters to sue in u.s. courts when a remedy is available in their home countries or the country of the ship on which they served. if no such remedy is available abroad, the amendment would allow those crewmembers to file suit in the united states, assuming they could meet the same burden needed to file any other suit. to be clear, again, this amendment in no way restricts a foreign crewmember's access to judicial relief if they are injured or suffer some other damage as a result of working on a foreign vessel. it simply says that they need to seek relief in their home country or the home country of the vessel on which they served before seeking relief in u.s. courts. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. nadler. mr. chairman, i claim the time in opposition. the acting chair. the gentleman from new york is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. nadler. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to this pernicious antilabor amendment that would do nothing but make it easier for u.s.- owned but foreign-flagged cruise ship operators to exploit and abuse the seafarers they employ. the right for seafarers to seek maintenance and cure for injuries, illness, and damages at sea has been a part of u.s. maritime law for as long as u.s. ships have flown the flag on the high seas. the effect of this amendment is clear: it would restrict foreign seafarers employed on foreign-flagged cruise ships from filing claims for damages or expenses related to personal injury, illness, or even death, in a u.s. court. this provision is completely contrary to a general maritime law principle that has been around since at least the 12th century, a principle that has remained applicable because of the international nature of shipping and the plain fact that, even today, ship operators maintain considerable leverage over individual seafarers. this provision also violates an international convention that the u.s. has ratified. under the shipowners' liability convention, national laws or regulations have to be interpreted and enforced to ensure equality of treatment to all seafarers, irrespective of nationality, domicile, or race. this amendment would shred that international obligation. it is also contrary to the principles and terms defining seafarers' rights under the international maritime labor convention. it is also worth mentioning that the amendment before us may be unnecessary because, in many cases, seafarer contracts contain binding arbitration clauses. in any event, it makes no sense to deny access to u.s. courts for foreign [[page h5839]] seafarers seeking compassion for maintenance and cure claims. the cruise lines can easily avoid frivolous lawsuits. all they need do is honor their longstanding customary responsibility to pay for the care and recovery of the seafarers they employ when they are ill or injured. in closing, no one has provided any evidence--much less, compelling evidence--to justify the reversal of longstanding seafarer protections. in the absence of evidence, the house should reject this unwarranted amendment. this vote is purely to injure seafarers, purely to disobey maritime conventions to which we are a party, purely to disobey laws of the sea from the 12th century that we have obeyed since we obtained our independence from england, for no purpose other than to help often american-owned--not always--but foreign-flagged cruise ship lines. there is no purpose for this amendment. the house should reject this amendment as it has in the past. mr. chairman, i urge a ``no'' vote, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. hunter. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. wilson). ms. wilson of florida. mr. chairman, today, i join with my colleague and friend, representative duncan hunter, in offering an amendment to the maritime administration title in the ndaa. the cruise industry, which is a vital source of economic opportunity for my constituents, has come to me with concerns about lawsuits it says are clogging u.s. courts and making it more difficult to conduct business and create opportunities in my district and elsewhere. i take these concerns seriously and want to help address them, but i also want to make sure that they are protecting workers and that we do not shut off opportunities for them to be fairly compensated if they become ill or injured in the course of their employment. the hunter-wilson amendment is intended to do just that. it safeguards u.s. courts against further crowding of court dockets, while not denying foreign crewmembers remedies. this provision has been passed in the house five times in the past 3 years, and most recently, the senate commerce committee included it in the maritime administration title of the defense authorization bill for fy 2017. i want to thank chairman hunter and chairman shuster for their work on this amendment. i urge my colleagues to support the hunter-wilson amendment. mr. nadler. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from washington (mr. smith). mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i simply associate myself with the remarks of mr. nadler. i think he explained the history of this law very, very well. it is a very basic principle. people who work on these cruise ships should be compensated and taken care of if they are injured. there is no reason that the cruise line industry cannot afford to do this. to discriminate against people who happen to be from different countries who are working on these ships makes no sense whatsoever. our laws apply to whoever is working on the ships and should continue to do so. this is simply an effort to deny workers' rights from a cruise line industry that can more than afford to take care of the people who work there. these are not easy jobs. i confess, i have only taken one cruise in my life, but the people who work there work very long hours, very hard, in very difficult conditions. if they are injured or sick, they should be taken care of. as mr. nadler said, the best way to do that is under the current common practice, which is the cruise line does take care of them and makes sure they get the healthcare they need until they are able to work. but if that is not done, the right to sue in court to protect your rights as a worker should not be taken away. i do not believe that we have a problem in this country that workers are being too highly compensated and have too many rights. we do not need to take away the few that they have. i urge opposition to this amendment. mr. hunter. mr. chairman, how much time do i have remaining? the acting chair. the gentleman from california has 2\3/4\ minutes remaining. mr. hunter. mr. chair, i yield myself the balance of my time. this amendment limits the ability of foreign crewmembers working on foreign ships in foreign waters to sue in u.s. courts when a remedy is available in their home country or the country of the ship on which they serve. that is it. they can still sue. trial lawyers around the world can rejoice because these crewmembers can come back to their home countries and they can sue and sue and sue. they just cannot do it in the u.s. if it did not happen in u.s. waters. it is that simple. again, a foreign mariner operating on a foreign ship in foreign or international waters should avail themselves of the courts in their home country or the vessel's home country before using u.s. courts. that is it. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. nadler. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman, it sounds nice to say they can go home to their country from which they came, where presumably the foreign-flagged ship operates, but that is not the case. these are often american-owned ships or european-owned ships, and they are flagged in a country of convenience--liberia, panama, or wherever--where the worker may have no connection whatsoever, where the ship, for that matter, has no real connection other than flying the flag of convenience, and where there may not be a very decent court system. that is why the practice has been, since before our independence--it has worked well the entire history of our country--that a foreign citizen working on a ship that calls in the united states, if denied the maintenance and cure that the ship is supposed to take care of someone on the high seas, then they can sue in an american court. we have always done this. there has been no showing of hardship whatsoever. yes, some rich cruise line operators would like, perhaps, to get rid of this obligation, but that is no excuse. this is an antilabor, an antihuman amendment. it ought to be defeated. mr. chairman, i urge its defeat, and i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from california (mr. hunter). the question was taken; and the acting chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. nadler. mr. chair, i demand a recorded vote. the acting chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from california will be postponed. amendment no. 43 offered by mr. mcgovern the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 43 printed in house report 115-217. mr. mcgovern. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of subtitle f of title v, add the following: sec. 564. atomic veterans service medal. (a) service medal required.--the secretary of defense shall design and produce a military service medal, to be known as the ``atomic veterans service medal'', to honor retired and former members of the armed forces who are radiation-exposed veterans (as such term is defined in section 1112(c)(3) of title 38, united states code). (b) distribution of medal.-- (1) issuance to retired and former members.--at the request of a radiation-exposed veteran, the secretary of defense shall issue the atomic veterans service medal to the veteran. (2) issuance to next-of-kin.--in the case of a radiation- exposed veteran who is deceased, the secretary may provide for issuance of the atomic veterans service medal to the next-of-kin of the person. (3) application.--the secretary shall prepare and disseminate as appropriate an application by which radiation- exposed veterans and their next-of-kin may apply to receive the atomic veterans service medal. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 440, the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. mcgovern) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. mcgovern. mr. chairman, i rise in support of the mcgovern- [[page h5840]] emmer amendment, which would simply create a service medal to be awarded to atomic veterans or their surviving family members in honor of their service and sacrifice to our nation. between 1945 and 1962, about 225,000 members of our armed forces participated in hundreds of nuclear weapons tests. now known as atomic veterans, these gis were placed in extremely dangerous areas and were constantly exposed to potentially dangerous levels of radiation in the performance of their duties. they were sworn to secrecy, unable to even talk to their doctors about their past exposure to radiation. thankfully, presidents bill clinton and george h.w. bush recognized the atomic veterans' value and service and acted to provide specialized care and compensation for their harrowing duty. in 2007, our allies, great britain, new zealand, and australia, enacted their versions of this amendment by authorizing a medal to honor their atomic veterans who served with the united states. regrettably, the pentagon remains silent on honoring the service of our atomic veterans, arguing that to do so would diminish the service of other military personnel who are tasked with dangerous missions. mr. chairman, this is a pitiful excuse. tragically, more than 75 percent of atomic veterans have already passed away, never having received this recognition. they served honorably and kept a code of silence. because of that, it most certainly led to many of these veterans passing away prematurely. past administrations and congresses have dealt with the thornier issues of legality in compensation. what remains is recognizing these veterans' duty, honor, and faithful service to our nation. time is running out. that is what this amendment seeks to do. i call upon my house colleagues to support this amendment that i, along with my colleague from minnesota (mr. emmer), have introduced. we owe it to our veterans to recognize their selfless service to our nation. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from minnesota (mr. emmer). mr. emmer. mr. chairman, i thank my colleague from massachusetts (mr. mcgovern) for yielding. i appreciate the opportunity to work with him on this issue. during my time in congress, i have been privileged to meet with many of our nation's veterans. the men and women in our armed forces are true heroes and truly the best our nation has to offer. yet far too often, they do not get the recognition and credit they deserve. this is especially true when it comes to our nation's atomic veterans. from 1945 to 1962, nearly a quarter of a million of our servicemembers played a role in the testing of nuclear weapons, earning them the title, ``atomic veterans.'' {time} 0930 since 1990, our federal government has taken different approaches to try and recognize and thank our atomic veterans, but we have never given official recognition through an award or medal. today, that will change with the support of the men and women in this chamber. with the mcgovern-emmer amendment, we have an opportunity to finally acknowledge the incredible sacrifice these courageous individuals made more than half a century ago. our amendment will require the department of defense to issue a service medal to the veterans or surviving families of those members of our armed forces who participated in aboveground nuclear weapons testing, were part of the u.s. military occupation forces in or around hiroshima and nagasaki before 1946, or were held as pows in or near hiroshima or nagasaki. this amendment has been included in the house ndaa bill for the past 2 years and is supported by the national association of atomic veterans. these veterans left their homes, left their families, and put their lives on the line to protect the freedoms and liberties we enjoy each and every day. i am honored to work with mr. mcgovern and our colleagues here in the house to ensure these brave soldiers get the recognition they deserve. again, i want to thank congressman mcgovern for his efforts on this issue as well as to thank chairman thornberry, ranking member smith, and the entire staff of the house armed services committee for their work on the underlying bill, and i urge adoption of this amendment. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, even though i am not opposed to the amendment. the acting chair. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from texas? there was no objection. the acting chair. the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i support this amendment. i have supported it in the past. and as mr. emmer just mentioned, the house has supported it in the past in each of the last 2 years. i admire the persistence of the gentleman from massachusetts in pursuing this issue. i think it is the right thing to do. unfortunately, we have not yet been able to convince our colleagues across the capitol or the pentagon to do this. i know of no opposition to the amendment. i think the house should continue to support it, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. mcgovern. mr. chairman, i thank mr. emmer for his support, and i want to thank chairman thornberry and ranking member smith for their support in the past. as the chairman of the armed services committee has stated, the house has, by voice vote, approved this twice before in the ndaa bills. unfortunately, the senate has chosen to not respect the wishes of the house, so i think it is important that we show a strong bipartisan vote on this. so i will ask for a recorded vote because i think it is important to send a signal to the senate that we are serious about this and we are serious about honoring our atomic veterans. mr. chair, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. mcgovern). the question was taken; and the acting chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. mcgovern. mr. chair, i demand a recorded vote. the acting chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts will be postponed. amendments en bloc no. 3 offered by mr. thornberry of texas mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, pursuant to house resolution 440, i offer amendments en bloc. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendments en bloc. amendments en bloc no. 3 consisting of amendment nos. 16, 49, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, and 71 printed in house report 115-217, offered by mr. thornberry of texas: amendment no. 16 offered by mr. desjarlais of tennessee at the end of subtitle b of title xxxi, add the following new section: sec. 3124. annual reports on unfunded priorities of the national nuclear security administration.

gentleman from virginia (mr. wittman). mr. wittman. mr. chair, i thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding, and i now look forward to entering into a discussion with mr. poliquin for the purpose of a colloquy. mr. poliquin. will the gentleman yield? mr. wittman. i yield to the gentleman from maine. mr. poliquin. mr. chair, i appreciate the leadership of the armed services committee in the seapower subcommittee on both sides of the aisle to accept this amendment and its important modifications to the underlying bill provision limiting the availability of funds for prior fiscal year ddg-51 arleigh burke class destroyers. my revised amendment, mr. chair, is agreed to by the committee and, importantly, removes the additional, or third, fiscal year 2016 ddg-51 ship from the provision's proposed requirements. additionally, sir, and again, as agreed to by the committee, it states the sense of congress that the navy should bear the majority of the share-line risk for the fiscal year 2017 ddg-51 flight iii destroyer contract, which will represent the first ships to integrate the air and missile defense radar, which is 30 times more effective and better than the legacy radar system. mr. wittman. mr. chair, reclaiming my time, i thank the gentleman from maine for working with the committee to improve the provision, while maintaining progress towards strengthening our fleet in the critical ballistic missile defense mission and capability. your amendment helps us do just that, while ensuring that we maintain the health and critical skill workforces at our two proven vital destroyer shipbuilders, including bath iron works in maine. mr. poliquin. will the gentleman yield? mr. wittman. i yield to the gentleman from maine. mr. poliquin. mr. chair, i thank chairman thornberry and chairman wittman for their support on my important amendment. bath iron works is a critical national security asset to our country. it is a source of great pride for all mainers, and the shipyard employs some 6,000 of our most talented, hardworking citizens who care greatly about their contributions every day to keeping america safe and keeping america strong. mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from florida (mrs. murphy), a member of the armed services committee. mrs. murphy of florida. mr. chair, i thank my colleagues for including my amendment in this en bloc package. my amendment will authorize procurement technical assistance centers to assist small business owners in pursuing funding opportunities during all phases of the sbir and sttr programs. these federal programs enable small businesses to perform research and development that advances the national interests and has the potential for commercialization. my central florida district is primed to benefit from these programs since it is home to a large and growing number of small firms that harness the power of technology, produce innovative products for customers in the public and private sector, and, in the process, create well-paying jobs and generate broad-based economic growth. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. pittenger). mr. pittenger. mr. chairman, i would like to also thank chairman thornberry and chairman sessions for making my amendment in order and allowing floor consideration. mr. chairman, my amendment is simple. it prohibits telecommunications companies that provide material support for north korea cyber attacks from contracting with our defense department. while my amendment is simple in nature, it strikes at the heart of what i believe to be the cornerstone of north korea policy. for far too long, china has enabled the north korean government to pursue nuclear development, global provocation, and egregious human rights violations. the chinese government is simply not a good faith partner on the issue of north korea. for example, there have been multiple public reports indicating that china's largest government-affiliated telecommunications firm, huawei, has been subpoenaed by the commerce department as part of an ongoing investigation into whether it broke our export control laws by conducting business with north korea. additionally, earlier this year, a similar chinese government- affiliated firm, zte, was hit with a record-breaking billion-dollar fine in connection with comparable north korea-related export violations. mr. chairman, my amendment is one of many steps that our congress needs to take to demonstrate to china we will no longer tolerate its alliance and partnership with north korea. i urge my colleagues to support my amendment. mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from wisconsin (ms. moore). ms. moore. mr. chairman, i appreciate the majority for including my amendment in this bloc. my amendment is straightforward, mr. chairman. it recognizes that any u.s. strategy for syria must acknowledge and respond to the tremendous suffering of civilians, including the millions who have been forced from their homes, who face starvation, cholera, a lack of access to adequate healthcare and education, not as an afterthought, but as an active imperative. the trump administration has already used the suffering created by the use of chemical weapons as a reason for expanding u.s. involvement in syria and to launch attacks against the syrian government. my amendment would ask the administration for a description of the legal authority relied upon or needed for the use of u.s. military force in syria, information which is even more critical now, given the recent attacks by u.s. forces against the syrian government and reports that we may continue to send more troops into syria. it is foolhardy and unwise for us to think that the suffering being imposed upon innocent civilians in syria should not be a consideration in any u.s. response or strategy outlining how military forces or aid will be used there. the humanitarian crisis spawned by [[page h5844]] conflict directly impacts our national security efforts. we ignore it at our own peril. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. roskam). mr. roskam. mr. chairman, i thank chairman thornberry, and i rise today in strong support of the lamborn amendment requiring a report on iran's use of commercial aircraft to support terrorist groups in rogue regimes around the middle east. the lamborn amendment delivers a simple message to iran, to assad, and all companies considering selling aircraft to the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and that is: congress is watching. congress is watching midnight flights take off from military bases in iran and land in war-torn damascus carrying terrorists, guns, and explosives, which will only be used to shed more innocent blood in the syrian civil war. congress is watching as boeing and airbus shake hands and cut deals with former leaders of iran's national revolutionary guard corps like hossein alaei, ceo of aseman airlines, who has called to destroy u.s. naval ships sailing in international waters. congress is watching as iconic american and european companies are choosing to fuel iran's terror campaign around the world. mr. chair, congress is watching, and congress will act to ensure that western companies do not become complicit in the syrian massacre. please support the lamborn amendment. mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the virgin islands (ms. plaskett). ms. plaskett. mr. chair, i want to thank the chairman and ranking member for agreeing to include my amendment en bloc in the ndaa. the amendment that we have is a transitioning of the virgin islands active guard and reserve from overseas housing allowance to basic allowance for housing. we know that, in 2013, the office of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness reported that a change would be feasible and would not be difficult to allow virgin islands active guard and reserve members to be part of the basic housing allowance. congress did not intend inequitable and unfair treatment to the virgin islands active guard and reserve members, and this amendment provides an equitable solution to the disparate treatment of the housing allowance for virgin islands active guard and reserve members. we are grateful for the support and are thankful that our servicemembers will now, in their housing, be treated the same as those in the 50 states and the district of columbia. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. jody b. hice). mr. jody b. hice of georgia. mr. chairman, i rise in support of the amendments offered by the gentleman from florida (mr. desantis) and the gentleman from north carolina (mr. pittenger). as we all know, north korea has targeted the united states with cyber attacks, and they are well on their way to being able to strike the united states with conventional and nuclear weapons. these two amendments would prohibit the department of defense from contracting with telecom companies found to be complicit with north korean cyber attacks or chinese companies found to be providing support for the north korean regime. there is no reason that we should be contracting with countries that are enemies of the united states. i also support the amendment offered by my friend from michigan (mr. bishop). without a doubt, nato is the greatest military alliance in the world, but that alliance works most effectively when the members of those various countries are pulling their weight and fulfilling their commitments in regard to their own defense budgets. this amendment calls on the president to encourage nato allies to fulfill their commitments and to recognize those who are currently doing so. i wholeheartedly agree with these amendments, and i urge my colleagues to do the same. mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from minnesota (mr. nolan). {time} 0945 mr. nolan. mr. chairman, my first amendment simply declares that none of the funds authorized to be appropriated in this bill can be used to deploy members of the armed forces to participate in the ongoing civil war in yemen. by passing this amendment, we ensure that no hero, no patriot in a u.s. military uniform will be put in harm's way in a conflict that can only be settled by the parties involved. my second amendment simply cuts off funds to any so-called friendly rebels in iraq or syria who make a mockery of our good intentions by misusing american arms and resources, and, in far too many instances, using them against us. we have already spent trillions of dollars, lost thousands of precious lives in these endless wars of choice in the middle east. it is time to put a stop to it, time to start investing in america and the american people. so i urge the adoption of these amendments en bloc. i would only add that the president, in his last campaign, had a message that we need to embrace, and i think the en bloc group of amendments takes us in that direction. he pointed out we spend $6 trillion in iraq and afghanistan alone. for one of those trillion, we could have graduated every kid in america from college debt-free. for another one of those trillion, there is your trillion dollars for infrastructure to fix the trains that are coming off the track and the bridges that are falling down. for another one of those trillion, we could have found a cure for cancer or alzheimer's or diabetes, and we still would have had $3 trillion for deficit reduction. i applaud this committee for all the work that they are doing and the direction that they are taking us back to in getting us out of these endless wars of choice and start reinvesting in america, the american people, and the american infrastructure. that creates good jobs and the quality of life that we embrace. to be sure, we must have a strong national security. there are evil people and evil forces out there that we need to protect ourselves against, but that does not mean we have to get involved in every civil war and every war of choice in the world. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. rohrabacher). mr. rohrabacher. mr. chair, i rise in support of this en bloc package. i especially want to thank the chairman for including my amendment as part of the other very positive amendments that he has included in this en bloc package. my amendment would condition the allocation of certain funds to pakistan upon a certification from the secretary of defense that pakistan is not using its military or its funds or equipment provided by the united states to repress minority groups, and to make sure that they do not repress these minority groups who are seeking their own political or religious freedom. at a time of high budgets, we should reserve our aid for friends and allies, and end assistance to pakistan in particular, which does not meet the standards of decency and freedom that the american people believe have to be part of any decision that we make here. pakistan has acted as an adversary not only to the united states, but has been aiding our enemies and repressing its own people. let us not forget that pakistan harbored osama bin laden. this is the prime mover, the man who organized the slaughter of 3,000 americans. we are fools if we continue to support a regime like that in pakistan today that represses its own people and is using what we give them to actually do things that make us less safe as a people and put us in jeopardy with the terrorists around the world. mr. chair, i thank the chairman for including my amendment to the en bloc package. mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. moulton), a member of the armed services committee. mr. moulton. mr. chair, i thank the chairman and the ranking member for including this amendment in the en [[page h5845]] bloc package, because i remain concerned about the lack of a clear plan or strategy in syria. as the syrian opposition supported by u.s. and coalition forces fight to liberate raqqa from isis control, we are confronted with the complex and critical question of what comes next. freeing syrians from the brutality of isis is but one part of a complex, grinding civil war that began with the assad regime's heinous violence against civilians and has endured for over 6 years, with over 400,000 syrians killed, 6 billion syrians displaced within syria, and over 4.5 million forced to flee as refugees. we now have over 500 u.s. troops deployed to syria to advise and assist syrian opposition forces. however, we have yet to have a clear, comprehensive political strategy that describes what the end goals are for u.s. involvement and how we hope to achieve those goals. this amendment requires just that, and follows a similar effort i led with general and representative john bacon on iraq that received bipartisan support in the armed services committee last year. this amendment requires a comprehensive political and military strategy for u.s. policy in syria to be submitted by the departments of defense and state to congress and the american people within 90 days of enactment. we owe it to our troops, those young men and women whom we ask to risk their lives in syria today, to tell them what their job is, what it entails, what the end goal is, and why it is worth the risks that they take every single day. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from colorado (mr. lamborn). mr. lamborn. mr. chair, i thank chairman thornberry for yielding and for his great work leading us on the ndaa. i would like to address two amendments that are coming up in en bloc packages. first of all, on iran, my amendment to the ndaa, no. 361, requires the president, along with various agencies, to provide the house with a report regarding iran's use of commercial aircraft for illicit activities. i am doing this with representative roskam. diligent research from think tanks, such as the foundation for defense of democracies and the american enterprise institute, have demonstrated the need for the intelligence community to provide congress with a report of their activities. in total, iran air, mahan air, pouya air, cham wings airlines, and the iranian air force operated at least 404 flights from iran to syria since the iran nuclear deal was adopted on july 14, 2015. now, this report does not block the sale of commercial aircraft to iran, but asks the intelligence community to take a serious look at these sales so congress can determine if they should continue. the other amendment i would like to address, mr. chairman, is no. 364 on boost-phase missile defense. mr. chair, i thank chairman thornberry for including this amendment, which was cosponsored by mr. kinzinger, mr. hunter, mr. franks, and mr. wilson from south carolina, to advance boost-phase missile defense programs. as you know, ballistic missiles are at their most defenseless when they are in their boost phase, the initial phase of flight. they are at their slowest, and they have not yet deployed decoys and countermeasures that would make it more difficult to shoot them down in later phases of flight. this amendment will make americans safer as we move towards advancing this absolutely critical technology. mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i have no further speakers on this amendment, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, neither do i have other speakers on this en bloc package, and i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. thornberry). the en bloc amendments were agreed to. amendments en bloc no. 4 offered by mr. thornberry of texas mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, pursuant to house resolution 440, i offer amendments en

[[page h5850]] mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. fitzpatrick). mr. fitzpatrick. mr. chairman, perfluorinated compounds, namely pfoa and pfos, have been found in public and private drinking water wells in communities surrounding over 600 military installations nationwide, including several in my own district, impacting 70,000 pennsylvanians. while the military does not dispute its responsibility for the water contamination, the response thus far has been unacceptable. for all of our constituents, they all have the right to safe, clean drinking water, and they deserve to know if pfos or pfoa have compromised their long-term health. the bipartisan amendment i have introduced instructs the secretary of defense to consult with the agency for toxic substances and disease registry to carry out a study on any health effects experienced by those exposed to pfos and pfoa at military installations or former military installations. while this study alone will not fix the serious concerns about water contamination, it will provide us with critical information about the health impact these unregulated chemicals may have, and aid the federal government in conjunction with state and local agencies to reverse the contamination and protect the health and welfare of our residents. mr. chairman, i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. mr. smith of washington. mr. chair, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. poe). mr. poe of texas. mr. chair, i thank chairman thornberry for yielding time. mr. chair, pakistan has been supporting all kinds of terrorist groups for years, including those with american blood on their hands. but instead of penalizing pakistan, the government has been rewarding them with hundreds of millions of dollars in u.s. aid. some of that money goes to support terrorists. previously, we placed conditions on military aid to pakistan, but these conditions are only focused on pakistan cracking down on one terrorist group, the haqqani network. meanwhile, pakistan is aiding and abetting a long list of terrorists in the region, including the taliban in afghanistan. {time} 1000 my amendment no. 100 places a new condition on any aid to pakistan. the condition requires the administration to certify that pakistan is not providing military, financial, or logistical support to any terrorists operating in pakistan or afghanistan. this forces pakistan to make a long overdue choice: either go after terrorists or lose millions of dollars of american aid. and that is just the way it is. mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from michigan (mr. bishop). mr. bishop of michigan. mr. chairman, i thank chairman thornberry for his leadership on this matter. the north atlantic treaty organization was formed in the ashes of world war ii, bringing decades of considerable peace and prosperity. still, there are powers today that wish to challenge the order from which millions throughout the world have benefited. my amendment to the ndaa, amendment no. 98, is a straightforward and simple amendment. it would call on all nato allies to fulfill their mutual defense commitments, secure national and regional security interests, and recognize our nato allies who are achieving those objectives. the underlying bill takes steps to strengthen our national defense on many fronts. it improves our overseas contingency operations, provides significant resources to rebuild our military, and increases funding for initiatives to deter russian aggression. my amendment builds upon those principles. as we begin to rebuild our military capability, it is time for our allies to do the same, especially when it pertains to our nato alliance. for far too long, the united states has shared an unequal financial burden in contributing to the global and regional security that nato provides. with new challenges from an increasing belligerent russian state, instability across the middle east and north africa, and emerging cybersecurity threats, it is time for all allies to honor their commitment and invest in defense spending. in order for nato to be completely effective, all nato members must meet their gdp commitment for defense spending and investment. this is out of fairness--for our effort to evenly share this responsibility and fairness to american taxpayers. my amendment calls on the president to demand that our nato allies honor their mutual defense commitment they agreed to by committing 2 percent of their gross domestic product to defense spending and research and to secure their national and regional security interests. only 5 of 29 member nations currently honor these commitments. while 24 nato members fail to meet their nato commitment, my amendment also recognizes the few nato allies who actually achieve those objectives. full commitment from our nato allies will make a notable difference in our effort to achieve peace around the globe. we must share equally the necessary burden of peace through strength. the acting chair. without objection, the gentleman from virginia (mr. scott) will control the time of the gentleman from washington (mr. smith). there was no objection. mr. scott of virginia. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. rosen. mr. chair, i rise in support of congressman lamborn's amendment to the national defense authorization act to require the president, the secretary of defense, the secretary of state, and the director of national intelligence to report to congress on the use of commercial aircraft by the government of iran for illicit activities. i am proud to be the lead democratic co-sponsor of this bipartisan amendment, along with reps. lamborn, roskam, zeldin, and sherman. as we are all aware, u.s. firms have reached multi-billion-dollar agreements to sell or lease hundreds of aircraft to iran, supposedly to help bring the country's fleet into the 21st century. i am deeply concerned, however, that these aircraft, intended for civilian use, could instead be used for nefarious purposes, such as transporting fighters to syria or weapons to iran's proxies, hamas and hezbollah. iran is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism, with a longstanding record of human rights violations. its support of radical groups throughout the middle east poses a threat both to our greatest ally in the region, israel, and also to u.s. interests.. for this reason, we must keep a watchful eye on iran's actions, including how it uses dual use exports from the united states. if iran is indeed only using american-made commercial aircraft for legitimate purposes, there should be no concern that a report confirming this would have an adverse effect on american trade. if iran is using aircraft to conduct illicit activities, we must be made aware, and we must hold iran accountable. i am also proud to have co-sponsored another amendment to the national defense authorization act that will help hold iran accountable for it actions. this bipartisan amendment, offered by my nevada colleague, rep. kihuen, would extend a presidential reporting requirement to ensure that we have an integrated strategy between the administration and congress to deter iran's nuclear weapons program. two years ago today, the united states, china, france, germany, russia, the united kingdom, the european union, and iran agreed to the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa), which aimed to ensure that iran's nuclear program would be exclusively peaceful and that iran would never obtain a nuclear weapon. i was not a member of congress when the jcpoa came to the floor for congressional approval, but had i been, i would have opposed the agreement. however, i have said since before i first came to congress that now that the jcpoa is the law of the land, the united states must demand that iran abide by it completely, and that any cheating or subversion should be dealt with swiftly. both the lamborn and kihuen amendments that i have co-sponsored are manifestations of this principle. if iran is directly violating the jcpoa by developing a nuclear weapons program, the administration and congress must be ready to respond. and if iran is violating [[page h5851]] the spirit of the jcpoa by taking advantage of new streams of commerce to wage war in the middle east, it should not matter what financial ties u.s. companies have to the regime. for these reasons, i urge my colleagues to vote for the national defense authorization act, which includes both the lamborn and kihuen amendments. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i would like to thank armed services chairman thornberry and ranking member smith for their support of my amendment to direct the secretary of defense to report on military cooperation between serbia and russia. i would also like to thank the gentleman from alabama, mr. aderholt, for cosponsoring the amendment. countries of the balkans are a part of europe. period. from the former yugoslavia, three have already entered nato and two are now part of the european union. in the wider balkans, even more countries have joined nato and the eu and others want to be part of both . . . . all, except for serbia, that is, which is unwilling to put itself on a path to future nato membership. frankly, serbia is not only keeping nato at arms' length. as we speak, it is continuing to rearm with russian weapons. in a deal reached on december 21 of last year, russia agreed to give serbia six surplus mig-29 `fulcrum' fighter aircraft, 30 t-72 tanks, and 30 brdm-2 armored reconnaissance vehicles. rather than forcing belgrade to pay for these items worth more than $600 million on the open market, the kremlin just gave them to belgrade. and, now serbia is seeking russian- made s-300 anti-aircraft missiles. if i were sitting in one of serbia's neighbors, most of which are nato members, i do not think i would be comfortable with belgrade's tilt toward moscow. even more, only last month, serbia joined russia and belarus in what the countries' called `slavic brotherhood' drills very close to nato- member poland. this is only the latest in a series of military exercises where serbian forces are training with russian troops. according to rfe/rl, ``the first were held in 2015 in russia's krasnodar krai, which is close to western-leaning georgia and ukraine's russian-controlled crimean peninsula. the second were held in november 2016 in serbia, while nato was staging a civil emergency drill in neighboring montenegro.'' if serbia wants to become part of the west, this is not the way to get there. frankly, i am growing increasingly concerned with the choices belgrade is making on military and security matters. this is why i wrote today's amendment. we need to take a closer look at russian- serbian military ties and judge their implications for us national security policy, serbia's membership in nato's partnership for peace, and the impact on serbia's neighbors. i know that vice president pence is meeting with serbian president vucic on monday. this occasion represents a good opportunity to present our u.s. concerns about belgrade's direction on security policy and a variety of other matters. mr. chair, again, i thank the chairman and ranking member for their support, and i look forward to seeing the report required by the amendment. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. chair, i am proud to have introduced the apollo i memorial amendment to h.r. 2810, the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2018. this year is the 50th anniversary of the apollo i spacecraft fire that claimed the lives of three american heroes. with this amendment we ensure that these three courageous astronauts, who gave their lives in service to our great nation, will be appropriately honored. on january 27, 1967, astronauts virgil i. ``gus'' grissom, edward h. white ii, and roger b. chaffee were killed in an electrical fire that broke out inside their apollo i command module on launch pad 34 at the kennedy space center in cape canaveral, florida. the accident led to a detailed internal investigation and congressional hearings. as a result of their sacrifice, nasa made needed changes to the apollo program which ultimately resulted in the successful apollo 11 landing on the moon two years later. my amendment requires the secretary of the army, in consultation with the administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa), to construct a memorial marker at arlington national cemetery in their honor. this marker corrects an unfortunate omission, namely, that these three fearless astronauts, who were set to be the ones to fly the first apollo mission into space, have not received a memorial at arlington as was done for the space shuttle challenger and columbia crews. as arlington national cemetery is where we recognize heroes who have passed in the service of our nation, it is fitting that on the 50th anniversary of the launchpad accident we acknowledge the sacrifice of the apollo i astronauts. mr. chair, it is past time to install a memorial marker at arlington so that current and future americans never forget their sacrifice as we continue to reach for the stars. before closing, i would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who supported the original bill from which this amendment was drawn, h.r. 703, the apollo memorial act. i would also like to express my deep appreciation to both mr. hollingsworth of indiana and mr. posey of florida who both offered to cosponsor this amendment. i hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will continue to come together to support this amendment honoring these heroes. the acting chair. the question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. thornberry). the en bloc amendments were agreed to. amendments en bloc no. 5 offered by mr. thornberry of

thornberry) and the gentleman from washington (mr. smith) each will control 10 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. davidson). mr. davidson. mr. chairman, i rise in support of my amendment no. 80 as en bloc no. 4. my amendment encourages collaboration between the faa and dod on unmanned aircraft systems so that the faa may leverage the unique capabilities and insights of the dod. these are important activities as the faa moves forward with incorporating unmanned systems into the national airspace. the efforts highlighted in my amendment are already ongoing activities between the faa and the dod, but more work needs to be done, as documented in a 2014 joint report to congress. the air force research laboratory located at wright-patterson air force base, afrl, in particular, has expertise in these sense-and-avoid technologies. afrl is planning to conduct unmanned aircraft research activities at springfield, ohio's, air national guard base in ohio's eighth district, upon faa approval. i am proud of our airmen and the work conducted at both springfield and wright-patterson and to offer this amendment to help the faa make good use of the capabilities located there. i also rise in support of my amendment no. 120 as part of this en bloc package. the acting chair. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. mr. davidson. my amendment is critical for ensuring congress reclaims its war-making powers by prohibiting funding for u.s. operations in yemen that are not in compliance with the 2001 aumf. i am concerned about any u.s. operations in yemen that are outside the scope of the current aumf and have no identifiable authorization from congress. my amendment is very simple. if the military operation is within the scope of the 2001 aumf, it is permissible. if it has not been authorized by congress, then it is not permissible. i look forward to working with the chairman and my colleagues in the senate to ensure this provision is adopted in the final ndaa conference report. mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman, i urge support of this bill. i want to begin by thanking the chairman and all of the members of the committee. as has been noted many times, this is the most bipartisan committee in congress; and i think, once again, even in difficult circumstances, we have proved that this year. that is, in large part, due to the leadership of chairman thornberry. i thank him for that. i also thank our staff, which does an unbelievable job. there are hundreds, if not thousands of amendments, that come at them. they manage that. you see the very few that actually come through either in committee or on the floor. they work through literally thousands of ideas and do an amazing job, so i really want to thank our staff for their great work. in particular, i want to thank vickie plunkett. this will be her last markup. she is retiring. she has done a fabulous job for our staff. she basically exemplifies everything i just said about how great our staff is, how they work in a bipartisan manner and do a great job to serve our country. so, i thank vickie for her incredible service to our committee and to the country. mr. chairman, i think this is a good bill that we should support because, make no mistake about it, what the chairman and many others have said is true: we face a complex threat environment. the u.s. national security is at risk. i take mr. nolan from minnesota's point that spending a lot of money on wars that we did not need to engage in does cost us at home, and that point is valid, but so is the point that we face threats we must confront. north korea is testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. it is no doubt that their goal is to develop a nuclear missile, capable of striking the u.s. being from the west coast--and they always say that it could hit seattle. i do not know why they do not talk about any other city on the west coast. it could hit a lot of different places. we need to be worried about that. we need to be prepared to stop that. russia continues to undermine not just our elections, but democracy itself, across europe, and even down in the middle east and africa. we need to be prepared to confront that. we face a terrorist threat. 9/11 killed 3,000 people in this country because we were not ready to prevent it. the groups that supported that attack have not gone away; they have metastasized. now, i will completely agree with some of my friends on the left, who think that the terrorism threat is often overblown. i think it is often also a mistake to demonize the muslim religion. and even though i know some people do not do that, they simply want to confront groups like al- qaida and isis, steve bannon, who works right next to the white house, has said that islam is a totalitarian ideology of subjugation, it is not a religion. he thinks all muslims are a threat. to the extent that we adopt a national security policy that views the world that way, we make the problem worse. that is what isis wants; that is what al-qaida wants. they want a clash of civilizations. we should not want that. they have killed more muslims than any other religion on earth. muslims have the biggest stake in this. we must work with them, not against them, to confront that terrorist threat that isis and al-qaida and others present. on the broader budget issue, as i mentioned a couple of times, the first 6 months of this year, we had a number [[page h5859]] of folks in the pentagon come over and spell out all kinds of nightmare scenarios about every bad thing that could conceivably happen--some of ones that i mentioned, and hundreds of others that i have not. and i understand that. that is their job. their job is to worry about what could come at us. but, past a certain point, that is not helpful. we need a plan, we need a strategy to confront this, and we need to make choices. that is the one thing that i am still concerned about with this bill. it really does not make choices. it continues to spend money in a variety of different places, without a recognition of finite resources and choices that need to be made about how to confront the threats that are most dangerous to us--how to spend that money in the best way possible. that is something that i think we need to work on going forward. we also have the budget problem that i described. and i will not give the same full speech that i gave before, but i will simplify it and say that there is a consensus in congress and in the country that we need to balance the budget without raising taxes and without cutting any programs that people might like. that does not work. it simply is not possible. it does not add up. that is why we do not have a budget resolution. any budget resolution that the republican congress could put on the floor will fail to meet some of the promises that they, and others, have made. we have got to be honest about that, because this bill, again, is $72 billion over the budget caps. it is actually $91 billion over the budget caps, if you add in--well, sorry, $81 billion over the budget caps, if you add in the money that we took from oco to put into the base. so, if we do not raise the budget caps, this goes away and leaves us, once again, in the land of uncertainty for the department of defense. we have to make choices on the budget going forward so that we do not leave the defense department in the lurch, not knowing how much money that they are going to have. so, we still do not have a budget resolution in front of us. and, lastly, i do want to point out that the rest of the budget does matter. the chairman and i have had a little bit of an argument about this: we are the armed services committee, we should pay attention to that; you know, do not sacrifice our troops for the sake of domestic--he always says political priorities. that is the one word in his argument that i find not really appropriate. there is nothing political about it. it is a policy choice. it is basically deciding what domestic priorities are important. and, make no mistake about it, the discretionary budget is a zero-sum game. i mentioned yesterday the president's budget: a $54 billion plus- up for defense, and $54 billion cut from nondefense discretionary. so do not tell me that one thing does not have anything to do with the other. but even the so-called budget resolution, the budget agreement that the house republicans have come up with, but have not yet dared to put to a vote, has a $72 billion plus-up for defense, and a $5 billion cut for domestic spending. so, again, the two are absolutely connected. what are we talking about with domestic spending? i will not go through all of it. i will just mention a couple of things. yesterday, i mentioned our infrastructure. bridges are collapsing all across the country. i saw a big story yesterday about how the memorial bridge is about to fall down. we have incredible infrastructure needs that lead to the strength of our country that are connected, just like national defense is to the strength of this nation. but another example, the fred hutchinson cancer research center--it is close to my district, it is in seattle--is doing incredible research right now, that figured out how to not use chemotherapy but actually go in, take out the white blood cells that are not working, get them to work, and send them back in to successfully fight cancer. this has worked for blood cancers. they just started studies on lung cancer. but, basically, we could cure cancer, without going through the hell of chemo. the president's budget would cut fred hutchinson's funding by over two-thirds. i do not think curing cancer is a political agenda. that is a very real need that has an incredible impact on the lives of americans, just like national security. it is like making sure that north korea does not hit us with a nuclear weapon, making sure that terrorist groups do not attack us. curing cancer, stopping bridges from collapsing, these are priorities. {time} 1015 because we are not making budget choices, these are priorities that get pushed aside. and if you plus-up defense and take it from nondefense discretionary, then you are having that very real impact. now, i am not going to say it has to be dollar for dollar. i think it probably should be, but we can negotiate around that. but to simply gut the nondefense discretionary budget to plus-up defense does not make this country safer. we heard yesterday, hey, in a time of war, you make domestic sacrifices. and we have all read about world war ii, all the domestic sacrifices that were made at that time. i get that. but you know what else you do in a time of war? well, you do not cut taxes. you raise them. prior to 2001, we had never gone to war without raising taxes or issuing war bonds or, basically, asking for more money. but that, of course, we cannot do. again, i will say i care enough about the national security of this country, i would raise taxes to pay for it instead of simply adding to the deficit or stopping the ability of somebody like the fred hutchinson cancer research center from finding a cure for cancer. that is the choice that i would make. these choices are not being made in this budget resolution, and i think that places us at risk. lastly, the nondefense discretionary budget is the state department, it is usaid, it is the department of homeland security. if you are going to have a national security strategy, it cannot just be the military. and you know who will tell you that more often than anybody? the military. they do not want to bear the entire burden. general secretary mattis had the best quote on this. if you are going to cut diplomacy, if you are going to cut development, you better give me four more divisions because that is how many more wars i am going to have to fight. so to say we are going to add all this money to defense, and defense is so important, and if you are against it because of other priorities, then you just do not care about the troops, is incredibly disingenuous because all of these other things matter to the national security of this country. and all we are getting out of the majority right now is an effort to plus-up defense at the expense of everything else. i say an effort because they have not actually voted on it yet. it has not actually happened. and it is more likely than not that this bill--good, though, it is--and the great work that has been done on a number of different policy divisions that do not have anything to do with the money, the good work on acquisition reform to try to make sure we get more for the money that we spend, all of that is in jeopardy because this bill has at least $72 billion in it over the budget caps that is, more likely than not, not going to be there come october 1 or the end of this year. so if we do not make the choices on the budget that reflect the priorities of the entire country, that actually reflect the budget numbers, then we are doing a disservice to the men and women who serve our country. it is a good bill. it is going to be better once we figure out the budget issues and actually start making the choices that are necessary to make us stronger in every aspect of society. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. chairman, i fully agree with the gentleman from washington when he expresses his appreciation to the members of our committee. each one of the 62 members of our committee has contributed to the bill that is here before us today and, as the chair knows, we have had more amendments considered over the last 3 days than ever before for a national defense authorization bill. so members of the whole body have contributed in many ways. [[page h5860]] i also agree with the gentleman that our staff on both sides of the aisle, led by jenness simler and paul arcangeli, have done a terrific job in helping to manage this process and to shape and guide what has been historic levels of interest by members on particular provisions. mr. chairman, i think that you would find among our committee virtually, if not unanimous, agreement on two points. one is we live in an increasingly dangerous world. the second one is we have done deep damage to our military because of the budgets cuts, the continuing resolutions, the erratic nature of funding over the last few years. certainly, the members of our committee who go out and actually talk to the people who serve have heard, seen, witnessed firsthand airplanes that cannot fly, ships that cannot sail, training that has not gone on, movers--we are trying to save money for the military, so we are hiring cut-rate movers, and members of the military are experiencing incredible damage to their household goods as they are shuffled about from place to place involuntarily. sometimes there are movers with criminal records who cannot actually get on the military base they are supposed to be delivering to. i mean, just example after example of how these cuts have affected the men and women who serve. and as secretary mattis says, the only reason we are doing so well around the world is because they have sucked it up and borne the burden. deep damage that this bill starts to reverse. i appreciate all the members who support fixing our planes, getting the training, having ships that sail, better missile defense, all the things that are in this bill. i am not going to engage in a detailed discussion about the budget. the gentleman and i discuss this frequently. i would just say, mr. chairman, i believe the first obligation of the federal government is to defend the country. article i, section 8 says that congress has the power and the responsibility to raise and support armies, provide and maintain navies, provide the rules and regulations for the military forces of the united states. that is our job, and i think that is our first job. so i agree that some of the cuts that have been proposed in other domestic programs, discretionary programs, are inappropriate, and we ought to evaluate each of them on their merits. and that continues to be my point when it comes to defense. we evaluate our obligations to the country and to the men and women who serve, based on the merits of this argument. we do not tie it to other domestic programs. we do not say we are only going to increase defense to fix our planes if we can increase the epa an equal amount. we do not tie it to other things. the obligations to the men and women who risk their lives stand on their own, and that, at least in my view, is our first obligation. now, when we start talking about budgets, we get into all sorts of conversations about how mandatory spending is really where more than two-thirds of the budget is; how that is what has been growing; how defense is down to about 16 percent of the budget, and as it has been shrinking, the deficit has been going up. obviously, defense is not the cause when it comes to deficits. we can also, when we talk about tax, start talking about economic growth and this lackluster growth that the economy has suffered, at least over the last 8 years, and the need to get things going to help with the deficit. lots of issues to discuss, but the issue before us today is how we fulfill our responsibilities to the men and women who serve and to the country that is relying on us to protect them from missiles, to help protect them from terrorist attacks, to support the men and women who are actually performing those missions. i think this bill advances that cause. a number of members on both sides of the aisle have contributed to it. i think and hope it deserves the support of most all members of the house, and i urge support for this en bloc package. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. carbajal. mr. chair, as we prepare to vote on the final passage of the national defense authorization act i am extremely concerned about the lack of discussion and debate on the issue of russia. as a member of the house armed services committee, i have heard from the leaders of our military and there is no question about the threat russia poses to our national security. it is alarming to me that a number of amendments, which purpose was to gain better situational awareness on various russian activities, were not debated on the floor this week. despite the fact that russia has continuously attacked and interfered with our country's democratic process, while continuing to threaten the democracy and sovereignty of other states, this body has decided to avoid a robust discussion on the concerning actions of russia. mr. chair, it is obvious that we have not adequately addressed the threat russia poses to our nation. reasonable amendments like mine that would have assessed russia's disinformation and propaganda activities along with its support for separatist activities were not made in order. mr. chair, why would we not want more information on these concerning activities? my amendment would have also assessed the suppressive democratic conditions in russia. is this body no longer concerned about human rights? i believe it is the responsibility of congress to fully understand and assess the threats other countries pose on our national security. i have no doubt that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will agree with me that russia has demonstrated to be a threat to the security of our nation. as such why are not we doing more to address this threat? mr. chair, this congress needs to have a discussion on how we can most effectively combat the aggressive actions of russia, and it is disappointing that we were unable to do this during the consideration of the national defense authorization act. mrs. bustos. mr. chair, i rise in support of my amendment to cut waste and strengthen our military installations. this amendment would require the department of defense to ensure that there is not usable space available on a military installation before entering into expensive leases or purchasing additional property. to put this into context, you would not lease space in a parking lot if you already had room in your own garage to park your car. this amendment is needed because, while asking for another round of base realignments and closures, the department of defense leased more than 6,000 buildings in fiscal year 2015 instead of using available space that it already owns. that sounds like a waste to me. my congressional district is home to the rock island arsenal, and we are proud to have it as part of our community. it houses the army's only remaining foundry and employs more than 6,000 hardworking people. but like many of our military installations, it has room for more. we should be using facilities like the arsenal to their full potential, especially when it means we can reduce overall costs. that is why i am offering this amendment today. i want to thank my bipartisan cosponsors congressmen paul gosar, dave loebsack and walter jones for their support of this amendment. the acting chair. the question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. thornberry). the en bloc amendments were agreed to. amendment no. 122 offered by ms. tenney the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 122 printed in house report 115-217. ms. tenney. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of subtitle c of title viii, add the following new section: sec. 860a. addition of domestically produced stainless steel flatware to the berry amendment. (a) in general.--section 2533a(b) of title 10, united states code, is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: ``(3) stainless steel flatware.''. (b) effective date.--section 2533a(b)(3) of title 10, united states code, as added by subsection (a), shall apply with respect to contracts entered into after the date occurring one year after the date of the enactment of this act. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 440, the gentlewoman from new york (ms. tenney) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. [[page h5861]] the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from new york. ms. tenney. mr. chairman, my constituents are discouraged. they are fed up with political elites who have failed to represent them, and with special interest groups who, too often, put impractical dogma before practical policy. in the rust belt region i represent in upstate new york, the impact of this has been devastating: devastating job losses, economic stagnation, and the massive out-migration of people and jobs, the largest in the nation. in my district, mr. chairman, decline has bred despair, which has spurred a host of other problems. in light of all this, i was elected to congress with a strong mission to reverse the tide and to revitalize our upstate communities to the greatness and innovation they once experienced. i am the voice for my constituents who have been left behind, and i am fighting to bring my district back on path toward individual prosperity and economic revival. mr. chairman, my amendment uniquely achieves both. there is nothing new or groundbreaking about my amendment. simply put, it reinstates a domestic sourcing provision for stainless steel flatware that was in law for 30 years without issue. my amendment adds stainless steel flatware back into the berry amendment. for 30 years, american-made flatware was covered under berry. however, the provision was removed in 2006 after oneida limited, the only berry-compliant manufacturer, ceased domestic operations. in the void left by oneida's departure came sherrill manufacturing, a company in my district that, since 2008, has produced 100 percent american-made flatware. and since 2008, sherrill has been among the top providers of flatware to the department of defense and gsa, fulfilling more than $6.8 million in federal contracts over an 8-year period. all these products are being produced in the formerly closed factory using refurbished oneida limited equipment, and also providing jobs for many of the same employees who lost their jobs from oneida's closure after decades of service to that same closed factory. in fact, gsa has repeatedly found sherrill's flatware to be offered at fair and reasonable prices, which is why the agency already purchases flatware from sherrill, independent of any domestic sourcing requirement. some domestic sourcing requirements may raise costs. no evidence has been submitted to support the claim that my amendment will do that. this alone should allay any concerns that taxpayers would be on the hook for overly expensive flatware, should my amendment be adopted. but if it is not enough, then there is this: my amendment retains all existing waivers under berry, which means that, if sherrill's flatware becomes too expensive or is of poor quality or insufficient quality, the dod can find other sources. ultimately, mr. chairman, whenever we can create domestic sourcing opportunities that reduce our military's dependence on imported goods and strengthen domestic supply chains without significantly raising procurement costs, we should. and this is what my amendment does. reinstating the berry amendment's domestic sourcing requirement represents a clear continuity in federal procurement policy, not a stark divergence. as i said, this provision was in effect for 30 years. thus far, there is one berry-compliant manufacturer that happens to be in my district and there should not be a problem with that, as we hope many more producers return to the united states, where their businesses were founded to provide robust competition. i also support this amendment for the simple reason that it is good policy. it gives a leg up to a robust domestic supply chain that spans five states while reducing our military's logistical dependence on imports. moreover, for the 30-year history of the berry amendment's flatware provision, there was only ever one domestic producer. under the berry amendment, this is all that is required. and in sherrill's case, we know it is a producer that has a track record of offering flatware at market rates. mr. chairman, in districts like mine across the country that have rusted-out factories that line the landscapes of far too many of my communities, today we have an opportunity to fix this problem and restore the once great empire state and our nation to the manufacturing strength it once enjoyed. i urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure. mr. chairman, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from illinois (mr. lipinski), my colleague, for some comments. mr. lipinski. mr. chairman, i rise in support of this amendment, and i want to make one thing perfectly clear. american taxpayers want their tax dollars to go to putting americans to work. this amendment means buy american and hire american. so i just want everyone to be clear. we hear a lot about buy american, hire american. this is what this amendment would do, and i urge all my colleagues to support this amendment. ms. tenney. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i claim time in opposition to the amendment. the acting chair. the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman, i have tremendous respect and admiration for the gentlewoman from new york and her efforts to represent her district, her people, and try to make life better. it kind of relates to some of the conversations mr. smith and i were just having about tax policy, about industrial policy, about regulations, about how we have, in this country, become less competitive internationally than we should. however, i must oppose this amendment because the bottom line is that it is not a matter of national security where the dod buys its knives, forks, and spoons. {time} 1030 if members needed further evidence of the wide range of issues which we deal with in the national defense authorization act, this bill is a key example. i think the gentlewoman accurately described the history. the berry amendment was passed in 1940 to make sure that food and textiles were procured from the united states to support our military efforts. in the 1970s, they put in a specialty metals provision, and attached to that was a comma that said ``including flatware.'' so then it turned out there was not anybody here at home that made flatware because of these international competitive issues, and dod came to us more than a decade ago and said, ``would you please get rid of that portion of the berry amendment?'' and we did. now the question is: are we going to start adding back specific sorts of items which dod may buy and say you can only buy it from one place, whether or not it is critical to our country's national security? now, the gentlewoman mentioned that gsa is buying some spoons and knives and so forth from this manufacturer, and that is great. if we do, i hope that happens, and i hope more jobs come to her district. but to put into federal law that the only place the department of defense can buy its knives and forks and spoons is from this one company, i think, starts to get us into micromanagement of industries and takes us away from the focus of this bill, which should be the troops, what is the best thing for them. so with all my admiration for the gentlewoman, i oppose this amendment. we cannot go down the road of adding category after category after category of items to help our districts at the expense of our troops and the best use of dollars when it is not a matter of vital national security. i just do not think that the knives and forks we use qualify as vital national security. mr. chair, i oppose the amendment, and i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from new york (ms. tenney). the amendment was rejected. announcement by the acting chair the

activities of the department of defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to house resolution 440, he reported the bill, as amended by house resolution 431, back to the house with sundry further amendments adopted in the committee of the whole. the speaker pro tempore. under the rule, the previous question is ordered. is a separate vote demanded on any further amendment reported from the committee of the whole? if not, the chair will put them en gros. the amendments were agreed to. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. motion to recommit ms. michelle lujan grisham of new mexico. mr. speaker, i have a motion to recommit at the desk. the speaker pro tempore. is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? ms. michelle lujan grisham of new mexico. i am opposed in its current form. the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will report the motion to recommit. the clerk read as follows: ms. michelle lujan grisham of new mexico moves to recommit h.r. 2810 to the committee on armed services with instructions to report the same back to the house forthwith, with the following amendment: at the end of subtitle d of title x, insert the following new section 1039: sec. 1039. rule of construction regarding use of department of defense funding of a border wall. none of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this act or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2018 for the department of defense may be used to plan, develop, or construct any barriers, including walls or fences, along the international border of the united states. the speaker pro tempore. the gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes. ms. michelle lujan grisham of new mexico. mr. speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. if adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. the national defense authorization act has passed congress 56 years in a row, and that is a testament to the collaborative, bipartisan work the armed services committee has done to support our troops who put themselves in harm's way every single day to defend our country. this year, the house armed services committee adopted an amendment introduced by congressman gallego to ensure that none of the funds meant to support our troops and safeguard our nation's security can be used for building president trump's border wall. the amendment was debated, amended, and ultimately adopted without objection by every single member of the armed services committee. if you ask the people who know the border the best, whether it is companies, lawmakers, border communities, trade groups, economists, or law enforcement officials--both republicans and democrats--most agree that building a wall is unnecessary, impractical, ineffective, and, frankly, a complete waste of time and taxpayer money. furthermore, the united states already maintains approximately 650 miles of border fence in areas that most effectively stop the unauthorized entry of people, vehicles, drugs, arms, and other illicit items. instead of a costly border wall between the u.s. and mexico, the armed services committee chose to fully fund military healthcare, raise the pay of military personnel, and improve our nation's cybersecurity. they agreed that president trump's ongoing effort to build a wall is wasteful and has absolutely nothing to do with advancing u.s. national security interests. i want to emphasize that this amendment incorporated both democratic and republican ideas, and passed unanimously in a bipartisan manner. but late tuesday night, house republican leadership stripped congressman gallego's amendment from the ndaa with the use of a glaringly undemocratic, procedural gimmick to help trump fulfill his campaign promise. republican leadership's actions to unilaterally open the door for funding the wall through the use of this defense bill is an insult to every single member of the armed services committee, to our democratic principles, and to the spirit of bipartisanship. they chose to undermine the unanimous judgment of the armed services committee without the courage to test their proposal with a vote or even a debate on the floor. you may hear my colleague on the other side of the aisle claim that prohibiting the construction of the wall does not fall within the jurisdiction of the defense department. however, i am not sure why the 8 members of the rules committee believe that they are more qualified to judge what should be included in the ndaa than the 61 members of the armed services committee or the 435 members of this deliberative body as a whole. [[page h5866]] further, i am not sure why the rules committee thought that a discriminatory amendment preventing the department of defense from providing medically necessary healthcare services to transgendered military personnel was more appropriate for debate than preventing trump from usurping funds intended for our troops. you may also hear that my republican colleagues claim that president trump cannot use any funds in the ndaa to start construction of the wall anyway. but that is not true. under title 10, the secretary of defense could transfer funding for that purpose this afternoon if he wanted, all without approval of congress. mr. speaker, the only way this body can guarantee that trump cannot use department of defense funds to construct the border wall is to put that prohibition in the bill explicitly. the only way we can do that is by passing my motion to recommit to restore congressman gallego's bipartisan amendment in the bill and ensure that our troops are not robbed to pay for a border wall. but i want to be clear: the adoption of this amendment will not prevent passage of the underlying bill. if the amendment is adopted, it will be incorporated into the bill and the bill will immediately be voted upon. we all have an opportunity to stand united to support our nation's servicemembers and to protect hard-earned taxpayer dollars from the president's political pipe dream. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support my final amendment, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. thornberry. mr. speaker, this is a procedural motion that, in my view, should be rejected. we could spend all day and night arguing provisions that prohibit what is not in the bill. there is nothing in this bill that authorizes a border wall. the focus of the bill is the men and women who serve our nation in the military and the national security of the united states. and that is what i want to take a moment to talk about. i would suggest that all of us think back just to the events of the last 10 days. on july 4, north korea launched what most observers believe is an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching parts of the united states. and we know they already have nuclear weapons. on july 9, iraqi prime minister al-abadi went into mosul to celebrate the ousting of isis with u.s. advisers, u.s. airpower, and u.s. intelligence. also, this week, the chinese navy conducted drills in the mediterranean on their way to conduct joint exercises with the russians in the balkans. this is just a taste of the world we live in, and there are provisions in this bill that address every one of these incidents, from more missile defense to getting more ships in the water faster and cheaper, to supporting our efforts against isis, al-qaida, and terrorist groups. but there is another event this week that i hope we all keep in mind. on monday, july 10, a kc-130 crashed on its way across the country, resulting in the death of 15 marines and one sailor. we do not know what caused this crash, but the early evidence indicates that there was a catastrophic failure when it was cruising at altitude. it will be fully investigated. but in the meantime, i think we always have to remember that, even on routine training missions, even on routine deployments, the men and women who serve are risking their lives for us. we owe them the best equipment, in the best shape, with the best training that our nation can provide. unfortunately, that is not what they have been getting. this year, our committee has heard testimony that, under the budget caps, the army is outranged, outgunned, and outdated. more than half the navy aircraft cannot fly. more than half the planes in the air force qualify for an antique license in the state of virginia. more than half the planes the navy has cannot fly. unfortunately, accident rates are going up. sometimes i have heard the argument that: well, we are not going to give them any more money until they can pass an audit or they can do this and that or the other thing. but as everybody rushes out to get on their airplanes, just think about this: what if the board of directors of your airline decided that they are not going to spend any more money repairing planes until there is a bookkeeping problem solved in headquarters? yet that is exactly what we have been doing to our military. we have not been giving them the planes and other equipment in good repair. every year for 55 straight years, congresses and presidents of both parties have passed into law a national defense authorization act. there is a lot of credit to go around, including the members on both sides of this aisle who have contributed to this product. i am very grateful for what they have done. but what i am really grateful for are the men and women who serve and inspire us, the men and women who are counting on us. mr. speaker, i would just say, whatever our differences on other issues, which we will have time to debate in another time and place, whatever our differences about what is in or not in this bill, we need to put those differences aside and continue to support the men and women who serve and defend us. let us not let them down. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. there was no objection. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion to recommit. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. recorded vote ms. michelle lujan grisham of new mexico. mr. speaker, i demand a recorded vote. a recorded vote was ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 9 of rule xx, the chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any
