$4.4 billion to backfill u.s. stocks; $1 billion for u.s. munitions production, such as 155 rounds and small diameter bombs; $3.5 billion for foreign military financing of u.s. systems and munitions; and $200 million for the protection of u.s. personnel and emergency evacuations of american citizens in the region as a result of this conflict. these requirements remain unchanged and are aligned with the biden administration's supplemental request. they are included, again, in the bill we are considering today. unfortunately, the situation in the middle east has continued to deteriorate since november. the houthis have launched dozens of missile, drone, and boat attacks on military and civil ships in the red sea. on january 28, three u.s. soldiers were killed and 40 were injured by a drone attack at a military base in jordan caused by an iranian-backed militia. just this morning, the houthis fired missiles at two civilian ships in yemen, one british and one american. we are putting our military in an untenable situation, and attacks continue to escalate. now, we must act to shore up our ally, israel, and provide our military with the resources they need to protect our troops in the region. the new funding in this bill addresses that changing reality by providing $3.3 billion for u.s. military operations in the region funded through december 2024. this includes $1 billion for low-cost defensive capabilities to thwart future attacks on u.s. forces in the region. in many instances, we have been intercepting low-cost iranian-backed drones with multimillion-dollar missiles. this funding will protect our forces and put us on the right side of the cost curve. this funding bill resupplies israel's defensive capabilities, restores america's defense industry to replenish our stocks, funds necessary operations for our forces in the region, and sends a strong signal that the united states will not back down. i am grateful for the support of chairwoman granger, chairman diaz- balart, republican leadership, and the dozens of members who have cosponsored this bill. i am also grateful for the support expressed by many of my friends across the aisle. we have an opportunity today to come together and send a strong message that the united states stands with israel. i want to address the position of the democratic leadership, including president biden's veto threat. assertions that this bill plays politics are patently false. last november, democrats said they wanted a clean bill. that is exactly what this is. this bill simply provides necessary resources to our closest ally in the region and our own military. i introduced this bill because it is the right thing to do. the only people making it political are those who oppose it. tomorrow is the 4-month anniversary of the horrific october 7 terrorist attack, which is an act of war. israel knows that we stand with them, and today we can send a clear message that we support their efforts to eradicate hamas, the only way to truly bring peace to the region. likewise, our american military men and women should know their government stands fully behind them as they respond to these numerous attacks. terrorists and those supporting them should have no question of american resolve. mr. speaker, i encourage all members to support the israel security supplemental appropriations act, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, 122 days ago, hamas terrorists murdered over 1,000 israelis and at least 30 americans in cold blood. they took hundreds hostage in the worst attack on jewish people since the holocaust. president biden's supplemental funding request for israel, ukraine, the indo-pacific, and for our border has gone all but completely unanswered by this historic do-nothing majority. for months our colleagues in the majority insisted that any foreign assistance bill must include border policy changes. so spoke speaker johnson at the white house several months ago, and he said that we needed a bipartisan border security agreement that would open and unlock the door for funds for foreign assistance. yet, republicans have rejected a bipartisan bill that would accomplish exactly what they have asked for. while declaring that bill dead on arrival in the house, the majority has opted to consider a bill that we know the president will veto. this is a political stunt that makes it less likely that israel gets its funds while endangering u.s. national security. this accomplishes nothing and delays aid getting out to our allies and providing humanitarian relief. our allies cannot wait, our border communities cannot wait, and our cities cannot wait. i wholeheartedly support funding for israel. i have written aid to israel supplemental appropriations over the last several years. however, i cannot support this bill which falls dangerously short of what this moment calls for. our allies are facing existential threats, and our friends and foes around the globe are watching and waiting to see how america will respond. [[page h479]] putin is watching, xi is watching, and the ayatollah khamenei is watching. russia, china, and iran are watching, and our allies are watching. this bill does not provide a penny in humanitarian assistance. we cannot abandon the innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of these conflicts, particularly in gaza. the costs of hamas' rule over gaza and the war against israel are borne by innocent palestinians. israel's harsh response has raised these costs further. families and children are facing unthinkable circumstances. millions are facing starvation because of this conflict. no one with clear eyes would say otherwise. furthermore, if this bill were to become law, there is no path to support ukraine. we are witnessing the first land war in europe in a generation, and through inaction, this congress is handing a sovereign nation over to a ruthless autocrat jeopardizing u.s. national security. vladimir putin wants ukraine. if he overtakes ukraine and moves against a nato ally, then we will see u.s. troops in a ground war. if we do not provide ukraine with what they need, then the ultimate legacy of the 118th congress will be the appeasement of a dictator and the destruction of a free nation. our allies and our enemies in europe and around the globe will know that the united states is no longer a trusted partner in the security of the free world. yet, we know that a supermajority of this body supports ukraine. there are unquestionably more than 218 votes in the house for a supplemental appropriations bill that includes israel, humanitarian assistance, ukraine, and indo-pacific assistance. yet, house republicans are refusing to take that path. the senate bill acts now to address the border that is in crisis. the status quo is unacceptable, but republicans say no to moving forward. we should reject this unserious effort, this political ploy, and insist on a bipartisan product that supports our allies and protects the integrity of our border. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, this is a bipartisan effort. this is a bipartisan bill. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. granger), who is the chairwoman of the appropriations committee. ms. granger. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 7217, a bill that will provide additional support for israel, and i want to thank chairman calvert for the leadership on this bill that he has given. nearly 4 months ago, we watched hamas brutally attack the israeli people. unfortunately, the situation in the region has only gotten worse. israel, and now u.s. forces, have been attacked by terrorist groups backed by iran. funding is needed to address the growing threats we face. the bill before us provides a total of $17.6 billion in emergency resources. specifically, the bill includes funding for iron dome, david's sling, iron beam defense systems, and other weapons through the foreign military financing program. to ensure that u.s. support does not impact our own military readiness, the bill restocks the items we have already sent to israel. it is also providing $3.3 billion to support our military operations in the region. now more than ever, we must stand firm with israel. the bill sends a strong message that the united states supports our great ally. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the important bill. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from minnesota (ms. mccollum), who is the ranking member of the defense subcommittee. ms. mccollum. mr. speaker, i thank ranking member delauro for yielding. mr. speaker, our nation faces two immense national security challenges, and congress must address them both: russia's illegal and unjust invasion of ukraine, which threatens their territorial integrity and the security of europe; and israel's response to the hamas terrorist attacks on october 7, which has spiraled into a regional conflict between the united states and iranian proxies. tragically, three u.s. servicemembers have lost their lives in this conflict. our nation and the world need decisive action from congress. the hamas attacks of october 7 were barbaric, and israel does have the right to defend itself. i have long supported missile defense priorities like iron dome in the defense appropriations bill, but this is not the way to get more aid to israel. the senate and the white house do not support this action. this bill was introduced to get ahead of the senate's bipartisan security supplemental which does address all of our national security priorities. the republican house bill plays politics with our national security, and that is wrong. it is a nonstarter for those of us who seriously want to address these crises in a comprehensive manner. here is how we do that: we do provide the assistance to israel, but it is equally as important to get more lifesaving humanitarian aid into gaza because if we do not, then the situation for civilians will continue to deteriorate; starvation will grow, disease will spread, and palestinian civilians, most of them children, will continue to suffer, and many will die. {time} 1715 because of this, israel's security situation will worsen if we do not do the humanitarian aid. we need to support our national priorities around the world. our servicemembers are working nonstop to defend commercial shipping routes and deter broader regional conflicts with iran. they deserve our support. we must provide additional security assistance to ukraine. the situation there is desperate, mr. speaker. ukrainian civilians will continue to be murdered, and their military faces a serious shortage of ammunition. we must remedy that. congress cannot afford to ignore any of these challenges because america cannot afford to ignore them. we must lead. the republican majority, in my opinion, is failing to do just that. if we fail here, the national security consequences we will face abroad are that we will leave both israel and u.s. troops in the middle east in a more dangerous position when it comes to iranian activities; we will condemn more palestinian civilians in gaza to die; and we will doom the ukrainian people to face a dark future with their democratic aspirations crushed by putin's boot. we will leave our european allies, who have just approved a 50- billion-euro package for ukraine, to face a resurgent russian military on their borders. the majority has left us no choice but to vote ``no.'' mr. calvert. mr. speaker, the bill before us today is regarding israel. we have time to debate ukraine at a later date, but today, this is regarding aid to israel, which we need to do immediately. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from arkansas (mr. womack), a member of the appropriations committee's defense subcommittee and chairman of the appropriations committee's financial services and general government subcommittee. mr. womack. mr. speaker, i thank my friend, chairman calvert, for giving me an opportunity to speak on this very vital piece of legislation. it is our solemn duty, mr. speaker, to protect our allies and defeat our common enemies. i think we have agreement on both sides of the aisle that we need to do that. on october 7, 2023, hamas launched a brutal attack on our friends in israel. we have all seen the carnage, the assessment of damage, and the terrific loss of life in israel. this unwarranted and unprovoked attack was a cruel display of the worst of humanity. we should all agree to that. israel is a stabilizing force in the middle east. it has to be supported at all costs. from my time as a commander of forces in the sinai peninsula, where i had a close working relationship with the idf, to my time as a member of congress on this important subcommittee, i have always been a strong supporter of israel and will continue to advocate on its behalf. this $17.6 billion appropriated will save israeli lives, and it will work to [[page h480]] defeat hamas terrorists. the funding will replenish and procure advanced weapon systems, defense articles, and defense services. it will provide for the procurement of the iron dome, david's sling, and iron beam defense systems to combat short-range rockets and support u.s. military operations in israel. mr. speaker, in short, we need to pass this bill. i encourage all of my colleagues to take a serious look at it. pass the bill. let us get it to the senate and get it to the white house. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. wasserman schultz), the ranking member of the military construction, veterans affairs, and related agencies subcommittee. ms. wasserman schultz. mr. speaker, i rise to support israel's absolute right to exist, to defend itself, and to bring home its citizens--and ours--who are still held captive after 122 days. over those 122 days, president biden has firmly backed israel's response to genocidal hamas terror. he helped free over 100 hostages and continues working tirelessly to bring them all home. he has forcefully countered malign forces who attack our troops and oppose any future peace. meanwhile, for 122 days, republicans have ignored president biden's urgent request: safeguard our democracy and our allies from adversaries who seek chaos, death, and destruction. this abdication of responsibility fails our constituents, our allies, and our national security interests. after months of waiting, i will not hesitate to vote for israel's defense in this moment of crisis. i am enraged that republicans are playing political games, caving to trump and the extreme fringe of their party at the expense of our most sacred national obligations. they cynically pound the table about iran, but they are suddenly blind to putin's wrath in ukraine and deaf to xi's threats against taiwan. they callously disregard the humanitarian tragedy facing gazans, who are also victims of hamas, eroding our credibility and undermining future prospects for a just and lasting peace. i am appalled that after 3,300 anti-semitic attacks in this country in just 3 months, they will pass a dozen nonbinding resolutions only to turn around and defund basic protections for jewish americans. we could have passed the president's emergency request months ago in a massive bipartisan show of strength. instead, republicans are needlessly weaponizing these vital efforts to score cheap political points. it took far too long to get here. yet, this bill still falls short of our needs. as a jew and proud zionist, my conscience demands that i vote with israel in her hour of need in this moment of crisis. i will not pretend this bill comes close to meeting our security needs. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. murphy). mr. murphy. mr. speaker, today i rise in support of h.r. 7217, the israel security supplemental appropriations act. in the face of terror and absolute unprovoked aggression, israel is in the fight for its existence. the united states must not shirk its duty and must support israel. israel has the absolute right to exist. mr. speaker, the world is essentially on fire. if you do not combat dictators, if you do not combat terrorists, we are shirking our duty. today, with the united states being israel's greatest ally, we must support them. we already sent the senate a support bill. we sent them a support bill for israel. we did that barely a month after the hamas attack on october 7. what have senator schumer and senate democrats done? they have sat on it. now, they want to send us a bill to try to fix their crisis at the border in the guise of support for israel. by the way, their crisis at the border, president biden's crisis at the border, has cost this nation $450 billion. that pales in comparison to the $17 billion that we are asking for israel. we do not need gimmicks. we do not need a bill, which has not even been passed by the senate, that will allow more and more illegals to come into this country. what we need is a singular bill to support israel, our greatest ally. mr. speaker, i ask my colleagues to support h.r. 7217. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. lois frankel), a member of the appropriations committee. ms. lois frankel of florida. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this bill for emergency funding for israel and for u.s. military operations in the middle east. on october 7, 2023, hamas terrorists brutally attacked israel, murdering, maiming, and raping innocent women, men, and children, and taking 240 hostages, many who remain in dark tunnels being starved and abused. adding fuel to the fire, iran proxies are shooting rockets into israel, jeopardizing commerce in the red sea and killing american soldiers on military bases. funds from this bill will enable israel to defend itself and the u.s. to protect our own military personnel. mr. speaker, i recognize and respect the concern of friends who support israel but want other also important issues to be addressed. mr. speaker, the perfect should not be the enemy of the good. let me be clear: my vote will be for what is in this proposed bill and not a rebuke of what is left out. i fear that a divided congress will embolden israel's adversaries and put our own military in harm's way. israel's security is our security. mr. speaker, i stand with israel. i stand with humanity. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york (mr. lawler). mr. lawler. mr. speaker, today i rise to show my strong support for this aid package that will support our closest ally, israel. providing much-needed assistance for israel and for u.s. forces in the middle east region reaffirms our unwavering commitment to democracy, security, and peace in the middle east. this is a funding package that will enhance israel's defense capabilities, specifically in the area of missile and rocket defense, with significant allocations for the iron dome and david's sling systems and the innovative iron beam system designed to counteract shorter-range threats. all of these are made even more necessary due to iran's investment in weapons for terrorists around the region, including hamas, the houthis, hezbollah, and others. these groups are expanding their attacks on u.s. troops. this aid package should transcend partisan lines. it is about more than supporting israel's right to defend itself. it is about securing our strategic interests and showing support for our closest ally, israel. that is why i was shocked to see that president biden swore to veto this legislation, which provides our ally, israel, with essential aid. there are no policy riders or poison pills. it is a clean bill supporting the state of israel. this should not be political, and it should not be that complicated. yet, for whatever reason, joe biden has indicated he would veto this bill, and house and senate democrats are falling all over themselves to oppose it. it has been 122 days since the terrorist attack of october 7. the house passed an aid package months ago. the senate did not act. according to reports, the senate may not even have the votes tomorrow to pass their supplemental bill. therefore, this may end up being the only bill in town. mr. speaker, i just cannot understand my democratic colleagues. whether you think it is political or not, vote ``yes.'' what, are you crazy? i just do not even understand the logic. it is a clean bill. vote ``yes.'' ultimately, even if the senate does pass their bill and it does come here, then we will deal with that. why would you ever want to be on the record, on a clean bill, opposing aid to the state of israel? it is foolish. mr. speaker, it is my sincere hope that all of my colleagues will find the moral courage to support this funding package and support israel at her time of need while providing critical resources to our troops overseas. a little common sense here--vote ``yes.'' the speaker pro tempore. members are reminded to direct their remarks to the chair. [[page h481]] ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from connecticut (mr. himes), the ranking member of the intelligence committee. mr. himes. mr. speaker, maybe i can help my confused friend from new york so that he might understand what is at stake here and why democrats are going to vote ``no.'' i stand here with some trepidation because, for a decade and a half, i have stood here and proudly voted to support israel, and israel has been attacked. i know that we will pass israel aid. make no mistake, what we are seeing today is a profoundly cynical political maneuver. for my friend from new york, let me explain it. mr. calvert, ms. delauro, and i were in the white house when the speaker--all of 2 days as speaker of the house--looked at the national security advisor and said that we will do border first, ukraine, taiwan, and israel. he demanded that. the white house said, no, we should not bind those things up because that creates the possibility that we do not get any of that done. then, we made very real progress. we have a bipartisan package that does all of those things. it counters putin's murderousness in ukraine, supports taiwan, stands with israel, and provides humanitarian aid. it offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do a border and immigration deal, an immigration deal that the border patrol union has endorsed. {time} 1730 my republican colleagues trot out the border patrol every day and say, look at these poor guys. the border patrol union has endorsed this bill. this should pass. it is a historic opportunity to stand up for what we believe as americans, but then something happened. donald trump called. donald trump called the speaker, and the speaker said it. he said, we know how he feels about ukraine. he said, do not do the border deal, a border deal negotiated with one of the most conservative senators in the united states senate. mr. calvert, ms. delauro, and i heard mitch mcconnell say: this is a better deal than we get if donald trump is president and we have the house and the senate, but donald trump called. i need to put another name out there: neville chamberlain, 1938, ``peace for our time'' because he kowtowed to a dictator. that is what is at stake. we will hang the legacy of neville chamberlain around our necks if we do not seize this historic opportunity to do a comprehensive security bill and reject this political cynical maneuver. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, the house was excluded from all negotiations regarding the senate supplemental, and today we are talking about assistance to israel that is needed immediately. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. rouzer). mr. rouzer. mr. speaker, i am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill authored by my good friend from california, ken calvert. this legislation provides additional security assistance to ensure israel, our greatest middle eastern ally, survives the most significant threats to its existence to date. the jewish people are confronting the unspeakable evil of hamas, which perpetrated a callous, barbaric attack against the state of israel, and continues to hold more than 132 people hostage in gaza, including fellow americans. israel needs our support to ensure they can win this war and bring every hostage home, as well as counter the other threats to their national security. this bill reaffirms the united states' strong commitment to supporting the people of israel by providing critical funding to reinforce the israeli defense system and does so without compromising our own readiness. in addition, it ensures our ability to protect u.s. citizens and personnel in israel. we cannot, and must not, turn our back on our ally. doing so would only embolden hamas, incentivize iran to continue funding ruthless attacks on israel, and weaken the security of american personnel in the region, not to mention the harm it would eventually bring to our own nation here at home. we either ensure that israel has the resources to win, or we will eventually be forced to fight the same enemies here. those who want to annihilate israel wish to do the same to america. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from illinois (mr. schneider). mr. schneider. mr. speaker, israel is fighting an existential war against hamas, a death cult dedicated to the genocide of jews and the annihilation of the jewish state, while also being attacked by hezbollah, the irgc and iranian proxies, and houthis. there is no question that the united states must support our ally, israel, but to my colleagues, i say it is folly to think that what is happening now in the middle east is not connected to what is happening concurrently in ukraine. if ukraine falls, the aid we are providing israel in this bill is only going to be a small downpayment to what will be needed when israel faces a strengthened hezbollah, backed by an emboldened iran, encouraged by a newly-empowered russia. and the united states will likely need to spend billions of additional dollars stationing more u.s. troops alongside our nato allies in europe. we are selling ourselves and our allies short by not taking the responsibility of leadership this country should be taking. if we do not continue, it is going to cost our kids and our kids' future. it is shameful that the republicans and speaker johnson are using our most important ally, israel, as a political cudgel. it threatens not only israel's security, but america's security and our children's future. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. van orden). mr. van orden. mr. speaker, i remind my colleague that, in fact, i agree with him this one time. these events are connected, and the connection is the incredibly weak strategy the biden administration has shown. that is why putin invaded ukraine and that is why hamas has gone crazy in israel. immediately following the attacks of october 7, i went to israel and i witnessed what hamas did to the jewish people, and as a retired navy seal combat medic, it put me on my heels. i will remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that there was a cease-fire on october 6; that there was a de facto two-state solution on october 6, and that was broken by hamas. unlike the vast majority of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, i spent my entire adult life either training for, training others for, or at war myself. there is a difference between the conflict in ukraine and what is taking place in israel right now. vladimir putin is a war criminal, and he is after territorial gains. hamas is a group of savages that are after the utter destruction of the jews as a people. they want to eradicate them. there is a member of the other party that has been censured on this floor for grossly anti-semitic remarks, and that is what is taking place. do not be fooled by this political rhetoric. i stand with the jewish people now. i will stand with them from the beginning to the end, so the river to the sea never takes place. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. khanna). mr. khanna. mr. speaker, i will vote ``no'' today on the $17 billion aid package which provides a blank check to netanyahu, ben-gvir, and the extreme rightwing government in israel. how dare ben-gvir, israel's national security minister, have the gall to criticize america while calling for the mass expulsion of palestinians? i will vote ``no'' because this bill includes zero humanitarian aid while children are dying and 400,000 gazans face famine. i will vote ``no'' because this bill undermines human rights and international law, ignoring the recent icj decision calling on israel to do more to protect palestinian civilians. i will vote ``no'' because it is painfully obvious to the entire world that what is needed today is a permanent cease-fire and the release of all hostages. [[page h482]] there come moments in a nation's history when our actions reveal our values. this is such a moment. we must stand for stopping the bombing, for ending this brutal war, and for justice in the middle east with a palestinian state with equal rights living side by side with israel. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from new york (ms. ocasio-cortez). ms. ocasio-cortez. mr. speaker, more than 1,200 israelis were killed on october 7 and 136 remain hostage. in response, 27,478 palestinians have been killed, 70 percent of whom are women and children, and most gazans today cannot reach a fully functioning hospital. this is not war; this is slaughter. and yet, after all this destruction and devastation, the netanyahu government is still nowhere close to their stated objective of destroying hamas. moreover, the united states has our own requirements outlawing the transfer of weapons to forces engaged in gross human rights violations. we have a responsibility to honor those laws, to facilitate a bilateral cease-fire, to move to end this campaign of mass casualty and loss of life that risk bringing the entire region closer to a wider, deadlier conflict. this bill contains $17 billion on top of the billions we already transfer every year with no conditions and no humanitarian aid for the most vulnerable. everyday americans should not tolerate this squandering of our resources without oversight on such an inhumane and ineffective operation, especially when we are living paycheck to paycheck, and they cannot see their congress address their most basic material concerns. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from michigan (ms. tlaib). ms. tlaib. mr. speaker, here we go again, sending $17.6 billion of u.s. tax dollars with no conditions attached to netanyahu's extremist government to drop more bombs on innocent palestinians. the israeli government has already killed 27,000 people, 11,500 of whom were children. i am tired of my colleagues coming to me, whispering: i do not really like netanyahu. well, then, why are we sending him billions of dollars with no conditions? he literally is telling us over and over again what his intention is. i am tired of my colleagues coming to me and whispering to me: rashida, i support a two-state solution. great. then send money that has conditions for a two-state solution because netanyahu has over and over again told us he never wants to see a palestinian state. i am tired. i oppose netanyahu's war crimes and want him gone, too, but many of my colleagues that continue to tell me that do not want a condition to aid. they will just give it to a genocidal maniac. my message to my colleagues is simple: if you do not support netanyahu, if you are disgusted by the countless videos of lifeless children pulled out of the rubble, if you actually believe in upholding human rights and international law, vote ``no'' on a blank check to netanyahu's genocide. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, the folks that believe in genocide is hamas. mr. speaker, i yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from florida (mr. diaz-balart), the chairman of the state and foreign operations subcommittee. mr. diaz-balart. mr. speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from california, chairman calvert, for his leadership in drafting this critical bill, along with chairwoman kay granger and the leadership for bringing this forward. mr. speaker, as mr. calvert just said, yes, there has been genocide, but the genocide has been from hamas. if the world needed yet another reminder of the importance of israel as a safe haven for the jewish people, then the attacks of october 7 should be that wake-up call. this is not that complicated. i have been disgusted and shocked by some of the things we have been hearing, including the sheer glee displayed in celebrations even in this country because of the murders on october 7. remember, those grotesque celebrations and demonstrations happened before israel even began its military action to defend israelis in gaza. let us be clear: those demonstrations, those statements, those celebrations were and are in favor of the terrorist group hamas. the despicable anti-semitism which has dramatically increased since october 7, that we have even seen here sometimes on this floor, has to be condemned and has to stop. israel is on the front line in the battle against terrorism--the terrorists of hamas, hezbollah, isis, you name it. all of them continue to wait for an opportunity to strike at israel, as they have, just like they want to strike here at the american people of the united states. israel and the united states do not want violence, but the problem is that the terrorists do, and they are the ones who have killed and butchered and maimed innocent israelis. last november, the house passed another israel security supplemental, which was fully offset by a rescission of the irs funding, and that was the reason why the white house claimed that they opposed that bill. now, there are zero excuses to oppose this bill. this bill does one thing, mr. speaker. it provides urgently needed funding for our friend and ally, israel, to defeat the terrorists that they are dealing with. the united states must stand with israel to eradicate terrorism. this is not that complicated. you can use every excuse in the world with the purpose of supporting hamas and justifying the murders. this bill stands with israel--no ifs, no ands, no buts. mr. speaker, i am grateful to chairman calvert for bringing this important piece of legislation, and i wholeheartedly support it. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california (ms. lee), the distinguished ranking member of the state and foreign operations subcommittee. {time} 1745 ms. lee of california. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her strong, strong leadership. mr. speaker, i rise to oppose h.r. 7217. the united states and the world are facing a very dangerous time, with the risk of being pulled deeper and deeper into conflicts across the globe. meanwhile, millions of people around the world are facing violence, dislocation, and hunger. this bill really is not a serious effort. as the ranking member of the state, foreign operations, and related programs subcommittee, i cannot support a bill that fails to meet the challenges of this moment and abandons those most in need of humanitarian assistance. yes, this bill undermines the united states' policy which supports a two-state solution. this bill is a blatant political stunt that is dead on arrival in the senate, and so i urge my colleagues to oppose it. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, may i inquire how much time is remaining on both sides. the speaker pro tempore (mr. ellzey). the gentleman from california has 30 seconds remaining. the gentlewoman from connecticut has 2 minutes remaining. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time to close. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, a short while ago, my colleague from arkansas said it is our solemn duty to protect our allies. indeed, it is our solemn duty to protect our allies. our ally in this case is israel, yes, and we support israel. our ally is ukraine, and we need to continue to support ukraine. our ally is taiwan, and we need to support taiwan. we have a solemn duty, yes, to provide humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians. we have a solemn duty to protect our border. these are not the issues that are part of this bill. this bill does not meet those solemn obligations. my republican colleagues do not want to help ukraine or the indo- pacific and taiwan. they do not want to address border security. they talked about border security as being the key to opening up the door to foreign assistance. they said it in the white house--the speaker did that--and now they have walked away from it. it is really a political sham. they do not [[page h483]] want to promote humanitarian assistance and leave millions of innocent civilians without food, shelter, and clothing. when i asked about gaza in a conversation with the director of the world food programme, cynthia mccain, she said to me: rosa, these people are starving. it is a famine. i believe that in this process of providing assistance to just israel and not our other allies, they do hurt israel and isolate israel. it is time for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to put our country and our national security ahead of partisan politics. what we should do is to vote this bill down. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. calvert. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time to close. the gentlewoman is correct. this bill is not about ukraine or indopacom or some other things that i would love to have some discussions about in the future. this is about israel. i think my friends on the other side of the aisle know i am not a cynical person. i have been in favor of moving an israel bill for some time, and now is the time. i think it is just simply the right thing to do. let us pass this bill. let us support israel. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. simpson. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 7217, the israel security supplemental appropriations act. as tensions grow in the middle east, the state of affairs is becoming increasingly dangerous for the israeli people and united states servicemembers. israel is our strongest ally in the middle east, and the israeli people are still recovering from the horrific october 7th terrorist attacks. this standalone israel supplemental package ensures our great ally has the resources and tools they need to defeat hamas, as well as provide important funding for our military forces in the region to deter terrorists and other enemies. the united states must send a clear message to the rest of the world--that we will continue to stand with israel. i proudly support that message and will vote yes on this legislation. i encourage my colleagues to stand with our great ally israel, and vote yes on this bill. mr. green of texas. mr. speaker, and still i rise. let me be absolutely clear, i vehemently oppose the ideology and actions of hamas as demonstrated by my vote in favor of h. res. 793, which, among other things, condemned hamas for attacking israel, taking hostages, and for threatening hostages. moreover, i have voted in favor of over $50 billion in funding for israel. the israeli people have suffered a grave injustice. however, committing an injustice in the name of justice is still an injustice. we must take care not to fall into the belief that any action taken in war is justified, especially the mass killing of innocent palestinian babies when war has been declared on hamas. today, i am compelled to vote against the israel supplemental legislation that speaker johnson brought to the floor. i take this stance because of the humanitarian disaster that now exists in gaza. this bill's narrow focus on only providing military aid to israel, with no accompanying humanitarian aid for the innocent civilians of gaza, is unconscionable. i cannot ignore the men, women, and especially children in gaza who are suffering through catastrophic conditions resulting from israel's war on hamas. babies have lost their parents and parents have lost their children to artillery and bombs that were paid for in whole or in part because of u.s. funds provided to israel. i will not be complicit in the slaughter of innocent babies. furthermore, the mass destruction in gaza has resulted in the decimation of homes and infrastructure and has made gaza unlivable. the lack of meaningful humanitarian aid from this legislation at a time when gazan civilians are at risk of starvation, disease, and death is unconscionable. for these and other reasons, i oppose this legislation. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from california (mr. calvert) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 7217. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. ms. delauro. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.
