[congressional record volume 170, number 21 (tuesday, february 6, 2024)] [house] [page h435] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] every month is black history month (ms. tlaib asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) ms. tlaib. mr. speaker, i want everyone to know and to be very clear that every month in the 12th congressional district is black history month. i was born and raised in the most beautiful, blackest city in the country: the city of detroit. countless black leaders, our neighbors, have inspired us all to seek change in the face of segregation, jim crow, economic injustices, and dehumanizing racism. we bore witness in our city to dr. king's first walk to freedom and the transformative work of so many of our black trailblazers, like mother rosa parks, james boggs, reverend franklin, and so many others. it was on our very streets that the fight for black liberation and civil rights bent the arc of the moral universe in our nation. from the iconic motown sound to powerful activism, our community's black history has a remarkable legacy. the 12th district acknowledges that black history and black lives matter every single day of the year. please know that you will also have a fighter in me in the united states congress. ____________________
