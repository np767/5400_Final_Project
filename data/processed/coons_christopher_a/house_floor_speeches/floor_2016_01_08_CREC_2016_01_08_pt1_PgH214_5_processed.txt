[congressional record volume 162, number 5 (friday, january 8, 2016)] [house] [pages h214-h215] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] putting the safety of americans first (mr. babin asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) [[page h215]] mr. babin. mr. speaker, for months americans have been demanding stronger fbi background checks on syrian and middle eastern refugees entering the united states, and just yesterday an isis-affiliated syrian refugee was arrested in houston, texas. rather than taking action to address these national security vulnerabilities, president obama shockingly believes that it is more important to increase fbi background checks on law-abiding american citizens. this additional round of unconstitutional executive action is a new low for this administration. their overreach on guns and law-abiding americans shows how truly misplaced their priorities are. sadly, it only confirms what we have already come to learn, that this is a failed president with a very distorted sense of the real world. mr. speaker, putting the safety and security of the american people first means ending this administration's refusal to secure our borders, refusal to respect the right of law-abiding americans to exercise their first and second amendment rights, and refusal to enhance background checks on immigrants and refugees from the safe havens of terrorism. ____________________
