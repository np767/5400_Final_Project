[congressional record volume 170, number 17 (tuesday, january 30, 2024)] [house] [pages h280-h281] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] southern border crisis (mr. bilirakis asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. bilirakis. mr. speaker, i rise because december marked the highest number of illegal immigrant encounters in history with 331 persons on the terror watch list entering the country since president biden took office. president biden falsely claims that he needs congress to act to give him the authority to take control over the border. let me be perfectly clear: president biden has the authority to close the border today. he can simply direct his staff to enforce existing laws and reverse the 61 executive actions he has taken to worsen the border crisis since coming to office. i will continue using every single tool at my disposal, including the power of the purse, to force president [[page h281]] biden to enact meaningful border security reform, such as the provisions we passed in h.r. 2. any action short of securing our border leaves our nation in peril and our citizens in jeopardy. ____________________
