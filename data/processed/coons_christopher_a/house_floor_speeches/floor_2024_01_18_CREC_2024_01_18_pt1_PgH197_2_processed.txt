[congressional record volume 170, number 10 (thursday, january 18, 2024)] [house] [page h197] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] we need to fix our outdated, broken immigration system the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new mexico (mr. vasquez) for 5 minutes. mr. vasquez. mr. speaker, i rise to speak today about a place that i love, and a place that is vitally important to our nation. i am a proud product of the u.s.-mexico borderlands, a culturally rich binational community, full of opportunity, which helps power international trade and is key to bringing down the costs of goods for all americans. i understand how disillusioned americans have become when it comes to addressing our broken immigration system and the challenges that we currently face at the border. i am frustrated myself. that is why i stand here today saying that both democrats and republicans have not done enough to fix our outdated, broken immigration system. the administration should look to the leadership and the experience of border house representatives, like myself, on immigration reform and border security. let me be clear: republicans have not brought forward any real bipartisan solutions that could help alleviate the impacts of the humanitarian crisis that we are seeing today. in fact, just this week, republicans introduced a toothless resolution that only serves as a political statement that vilifies immigrants. further, republicans did this in the same week that extreme rightwing immigration policies in the state of texas led to the death of two migrant children who drowned in the rio grande. this is disgraceful. it is not who we are. it is un-american. trust me, i am tired of congress kicking this can down the road for over 30 years. that is why i have introduced a package of commonsense legislation that could help solve this problem. we can fix this crisis, but we cannot do it while we lose our humanity. we can do that by securing our border, while also ensuring immigrants are treated humanely. after all, we are a nation of immigrants. that means investing in customs agents who work long hours and providing them with the tools they need to do their jobs. it means modernizing our legal system to match our needs. it means giving new americans the opportunity to fill the jobs that our nation and our communities desperately need. i am a proud democrat, but i am an american first, and right now that means holding everybody accountable to bring real solutions to the american people. ____________________
