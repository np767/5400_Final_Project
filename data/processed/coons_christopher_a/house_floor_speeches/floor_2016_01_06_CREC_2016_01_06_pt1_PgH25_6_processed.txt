[congressional record volume 162, number 3 (wednesday, january 6, 2016)] [house] [pages h25-h26] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] gun violence and obama's executive actions (ms. hahn asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) ms. hahn. mr. speaker, i have stood here many times in the last few years with the same message to my colleagues: let us take action on gun violence and save some lives. i have named horrible statistics on gun death, like young people in the united states are more likely to be killed by a gun than in a car accident. i have told stories about people who have suffered incredible loss, like vicky lindsey from compton, who lost her son to gun violence and founded project cry no more. i have cited polls showing bipartisan support from voters for sensible reforms; but year after year, congress [[page h26]] has refused to act, despite its knowing how easy it is for criminals and dangerous people to buy these deadly weapons. this week there was a bright spot. president obama has taken executive action to increase the number of background checks on gun sales, a move which we know will help to keep guns out of dangerous hands. i thank the president, but our work to prevent gun deaths cannot end there. congress must finish the job by instituting universal background checks, banning assault weapons, and closing the dangerous loophole that allows a gun dealer to sell a gun if the fbi has not completed the background check within 3 days. we have to act. there is no excuse not to. ____________________
