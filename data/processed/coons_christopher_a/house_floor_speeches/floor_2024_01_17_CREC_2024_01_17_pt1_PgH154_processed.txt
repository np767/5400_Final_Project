[congressional record volume 170, number 9 (wednesday, january 17, 2024)] [house] [page h154] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] team alabama working together (mr. carl asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. carl. mr. speaker, unfortunately it often takes tragic events to bring us all together. last week, a tornado ripped through cottonwood, alabama, and it basically destroyed the entire town of about 1,200 people. this weekend, i had the opportunity to visit with the folks in cottonwood and to see how i could help. small communities like this do not have the resources that other big cities have to recover from a storm. the community has to come together to rebuild their homes and their community, and that is exactly what cottonwood is doing. it is very moving to see everyone come together and to help each other. this is what the alabama family is truly all about. i am grateful today and every day to be part of team alabama working together at the local, state, and federal level to rebuild our storm- damaged communities and begin to return to normalcy. ____________________
