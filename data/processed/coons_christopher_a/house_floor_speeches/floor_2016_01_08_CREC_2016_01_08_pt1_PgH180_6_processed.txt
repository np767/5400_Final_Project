[congressional record volume 162, number 5 (friday, january 8, 2016)] [house] [pages h180-h181] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing farm families of the year (ms. graham asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) ms. graham. mr. speaker, today i rise to recognize the second congressional district's farm families of the year. each year, the florida farm bureau recognizes families across north florida for their commitment to farming and our community. these families work hard every day to provide food for our tables and, just as importantly, they know farming is more than a job. it is a way of life and a part of our heritage. [[page h181]] our farm families are the backbone of north florida. recognizing them with this award is just one thing we can do to show how much we appreciate their hard work and sacrifice. i look forward to further recognizing them and highlighting their work as i begin the first official north florida farm tour. i will be visiting all 14 counties in my district. again, congratulations to our farm families of the year, and thank you to all of our state's farmers. ____________________
