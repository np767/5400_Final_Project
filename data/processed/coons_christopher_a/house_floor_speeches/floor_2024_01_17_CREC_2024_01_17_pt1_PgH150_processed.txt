[congressional record volume 170, number 9 (wednesday, january 17, 2024)] [house] [page h150] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring peter richard sgro the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from guam (mr. moylan) for 5 minutes. mr. moylan. mr. speaker, i would like to take this time to honor the life and legacy of the late peter richard sgro, who sadly left this world on january 9. peter was iconic on so many levels that his outside-the-box vision and drive to effectuate change will be deeply missed. as an attorney, peter always believed in seeking justice for his clients. he never walked away from a fight if he knew that virtue needed to prevail, and in his case, virtue certainly always prevailed. as the chairman of the board of the guam chamber of commerce, peter evidenced that he was an advocate for small businesses, particularly the little guy. he stood with them to challenge policies that would raise the cost of doing business, and his relentlessness ensured that he would not sit down until compromises were made. as a businessman, peter was a visionary, and this was clear when he worked aggressively to bring a private hospital to open its doors in guam. peter understood the necessities to improve and expand healthcare for families, and whenever we drive by the guam regional medical city in the northern part of guam, we can evidently see peter's legacy on display. for all the roles peter embraced to help guam prosper over the decades, there was none that he enjoyed more than being a father to christopher, matthew, katarina, and maria, and a grandfather to ricardo, natalia, and mila. they were his foundation, his purpose, and his pride. my heart and my deepest condolences go out to them in this trying time. in 2022, as a guam senator, i had the honor of recognizing peter and his legacy as his company, international group, inc., was celebrating an anniversary. i am saddened that in such a short period of less than 2 years, i am recognizing him under a different set of circumstances. mr. speaker, of behalf of a thankful nation and an appreciative island of guam, i honor the life and legacy of peter richard sgro and thank him for his many contributions to our island community. he will be dearly missed. adios to my friend, until we meet again. ____________________
