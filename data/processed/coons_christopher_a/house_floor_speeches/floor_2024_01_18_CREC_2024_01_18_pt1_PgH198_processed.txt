[congressional record volume 170, number 10 (thursday, january 18, 2024)] [house] [page h198] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring the life of sonny adkins, jr. the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from south carolina (mr. norman) for 5 minutes. mr. norman. madam speaker, i rise today to honor the life of a truly great american, mr. sonny adkins, jr., who passed away on november 26, 2023. sonny was born in york county, south carolina, and was the husband of the late billie jones adkins, who was truly the love of his life. in the early 1960s, sonny started a business with his first sidekicks, as he called them, billie adkins and sam robinson. the name of his company was adkins oil burner service, later to become adkins heating & cooling. sonny ran his business every day focused on the care and love of his customers and built great relationships with all of the wonderful customers that he served. sonny ended up raising his own workers, as his children grew up and became the adkins' employees. sonny said many times, ``i raised my own workers the way i wanted them to be.'' each struggle he faced was a lesson to the family on how to live a full life. in his recent days, he spent time riding his hay fields on a mule planning for the next hay season in his head. his planning included detailed instructions for the farmhands, also his family and friends, on what was needed to be done, and, more importantly, how to do it right, which was sonny's way. sonny wore many hats. he was a god-loving man, a great teacher to his family, the land developer of carrollton place, and a farmer. however, the most important roles that he filled were being a wonderful son, brother, husband, father, uncle, paw paw, and friend. at his funeral, there was a poem that was read that i think was so fitting for the life of sonny adkins. it goes like this: do not stand at my grave and weep. i am not there; i do not sleep. i am a thousand winds that blow; i am the diamond glints on snow. i am the sunlight on ripened grain; i am the gentle autumn's rain. do not stand at my grave and mourn. i am the dew-flecked grass at dawn. when tranquil oceans meet the land i am the footprints in the sand to guide you through the weary day. i am still here; i will always stay. when you wake up to morning's hush i am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight. i am the stars that shine at night. do not stand at my grave and cry. i am not there; i did not die. many funerals we go to, the sermon does not match the man, but with sonny adkins, the words definitely matched the man, and what a tribute to a life well lived. ____________________
