i am here with my colleague senator murkowski from alaska to talk about all the great work that was put into the senate energy modernization act and i know the presiding officer knows well how much work was put into that legislation and we are here today to say that after many markups and many amendments and what was a unbelievable senate vote of 85 to 12 that we still believe that our house colleagues should extend their time here in congress to consider the conference report on an energy modernization and natural resources agreement we say that because there is so much important work still to be done we reached an agreement on extending the national park service 100 birthday by making an investment in our national park system we had responses from 47 senators and were able to protect hundreds of acres of land. we were able to reach agreements with both bodies on important issues like water resources providing and securing funding for fighting forest fires making sure that communities who are at risk got the attention that they so deserve and i can say from the state of washington having lost seven individuals and fighting fires over the last decade and a half this is so important for us to make sure that we get it right and provide the communities the resources they need to fight fires we were able to reach agreement on cyber security and how much our infrastructure and grid needs to be protected and go to work on that by improving the capabilities of the grid and making sure the doe was in charge of that not just talking about hardening some of our physical infrastructure like our hydro system but actually the work that it takes to make our grid more resilient from hacking and cyber attacks and also to make sure that the workforce was there we reached agreement on that in increasing the workforce of the energy system that has been outlined in the quadruiner review that we need a million and a half new workers in energy so we were able to do that along with a hydro agreement agreement on nuclear power and many many other areas of science that were so important to us so it is so frustrating at this time mr. president that as we went through the normal process of doing an energy bill we did through the hard work of working with our colleagues here on the senate floor which included i do not know if it got to a hundred amendments, but i am sure we considered and worked through a hundred plus amendments to then work all summer long and all fall with our house colleagues on reaching conference it is so disappointing to have our house colleagues refused to agree to these important provisions and i mentioned many of them, but i forgot to mention the sportsman bill and all the lands packages that are part of this these are hard fought issues that are hard to agree on they are hard to agree on because they mean coming to the table and taking into consideration all the interests so whether you are talking about sportsmen and the open-amp access to hunting which my colleague from alaska so championed or whether you are talking about how to get water agreements that involve fishermen and tribes and farmers and a variety of river interests. we were able to accomplish that or whether you are talking about fixing the fire funding fix that was been debated back and forth between our house and senate colleagues for almost seven or eight years now all of these things we were able to reach agreement on so it is really irresponsible for our house colleagues to drop the ball and not considering these solutions and taking yes for an answer to act on them what is even more outrageous is now the house once to take a piece of energy policy that should have been of considered by our committee this california water issue and think that they can air drop it into the word of bill that is not even in its jurisdiction so as much as our house colleagues like to talk about the no-air mark rule the california water deal that is now being decried in newspapers in california as the midnight writer and basically saying we should reject the midnight writer is a bill that was air dropped in as an earmark in the word a bill and is being sent over here a policy that should be considered by the energy committee so i say to my colleagues that if you want the hard work of your energy policy considered in the future and you want energy policy to be a consensus of people working in the regular order process of the united states senate and you want us to reach consensus you need to say to our house colleagues and to those who are refusing to move forward on a conference report that this is problematic that the senate that we all know and the house and the conference that we all know is a process for us to work out agreements not sidetrack them or drop into other bills items that have not been worked out and basically do not adhere to the rules of the senate or even the own rules that the house is claiming to have on earmarks so it is a very cynical view of the world if the house can only pass energy legislation that is air dropped in in another committee that violates its own rules and basically overruns what is by the sportsmen the sports fishermen the basically trout and limited and many sportsmen groups what is basically a very collaborative process for engaging our public lands and resources and turning it into back room deal-making in the house of representatives so i joined my colleague tonight to just explain the great work that was done in our conference and hard work i think she and i believe in it. i think we believe in the senate the way it is supposed to work we believe in the hard work that it took to reach compromise on so many issues and i think we want to make sure that our colleagues know that getting to yes was just inches away and very unfortunate that the house instead of doing that homework sends a very cynical approach to the legislative arena that seems really i thought something that we jettisoned a decade ago in house politics air dropping things in at the dark of night and instead were ernest about making sure that we had transparency so i hope that our colleagues will understand these are important policy issues take the remaining days if we happen to be here extra few days this weekend or even into next week renew the effort with your leader in the house and encourage them to get the great energy work done and bank what is public policy in the best interest of the united states? i thank the president and i yield the floor and i just want to thank my colleague from alaska for her leadership on the energy committee her hard work and dedication or willingness to work across the aisle and in a willingness to be very tough on how important thorny public process policy could be in these areas, but not to back away from that and find solutions for everybody in the united states in it i thank the president
