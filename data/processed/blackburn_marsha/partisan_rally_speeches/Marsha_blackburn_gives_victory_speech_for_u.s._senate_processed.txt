allowing me to be the first woman ever elected. and just imagine this, it is a conservative woman to be... and you know, one person does not win a campaign. it takes a host of volunteers and so many of you have done that. our volunteers not done over 1,562,000 doors. you made... you made 3 million phone calls and countless prayers. and i thank you all for those prayers. you have written notes.

you do not have to worry if you are going to call me congressman or congresswoman or congresswoman. now. senator will do. thank you. thank you john. yes, that is great. i tell you, john and grachan and the entertainment tonight, i thought this is i love this. i was coming through the hallway and i heard grachan with redneck mom and i said that is one of my favorites. i love it. derral waldorf is here. so many of you have said they love that commercial. i do want to say, let me tell you this. i think one of the things we learned from this campaign is tennesseeans want to make certain that they have leaders who are not going to kick a can down the road on the issues that affect our nation. they want leaders who are going to tackle the big problems and they want leaders who are going to be there to work with the president and keep this nation on the path to prosperity that we are on today. i want you to know i am going to be one of those leaders and i want to say a special thank you to the president and to the vice president for the support. the interest in this campaign, their support, i have already talked to vice president pence and mrs. pence and they are really excited. they are excited for our family, they are excited for our state, they are excited for our country. and just as i said on day one of this campaign, i was running to take those values that we share and to work in dc, all the things that you want to see done, more constitutional judges, lower taxes, less regulation, making certain that we protect life that we defend the second amendment. yet, yet federal spending under control and that we support our troops and our veterans and support camel and to make certain that we build the wall. i know a lot of our law enforcement are here tonight and they have been so supportive of me. i thank them for the fraternal order of police endorsement and i got to tell you they remind me regularly if we do not secure that southern border it turns to every state into a border state, every town into a border. so you have my command on that. so we want to make certain that you all know we are going to continue to do what we do. work every day, as i say, i get up and i fight for what i call the big five, faith, family, freedom, hope and opportunity. and i have asked you to do this campaign to stand with me tonight is no different. i ask that you stand with me as we work on these issues for our state, for our nation. we know that we are going to be going to work early tomorrow on these issues. the transition begins. i look forward to being your senator. god bless tennessee. god bless you. thank you.
