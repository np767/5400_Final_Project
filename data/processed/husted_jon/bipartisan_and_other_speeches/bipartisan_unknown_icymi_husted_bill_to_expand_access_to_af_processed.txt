icymi: husted bill to expand access to affordable medications becomes law november 14, 2025 “with the smart otc act now law, families will have better access to over-the-counter medicines at lower costs—improving health and supporting people across ohio and the nation.” washington – sen. jon husted’s (r-ohio) bipartisan bill, the streamlined market access and reform for therapeutics over-the-counter (smart otc) act, became law when president donald trump approved the appropriations package. this is his second bill to be signed into law in the 10 months since he joined the senate. “ohioans deserve access to affordable, high-quality health care. reducing barriers to safe medications empowers the american public to take charge of their health without the fear of burning a hole through their pocket. with the smart otc act now law, families will have access to more over-the-counter medicines. my number one priority since taking office is making life easier and more affordable for ohioans, and this bill continues that work as it helps people get the medications they need at a lower cost,” said husted. husted’s first bill became law in may, reversing a burdensome biden energy rule that raised costs for taxpayers. both of husted’s laws reflect his ongoing commitment to affordability and improving everyday life for ohio families. the smart otc act will modernize the food and drug administration’s process for giving certain prescription drugs status as over-the-counter (otc) options. health care costs have risen in recent years. part of those costs arise when safe, proven medications are stuck behind the prescription counter. every dollar spent on otc medications saves the u.s. health care system $7.33. the smart otc act builds on husted’s work to provide high-quality health care for ohioans. full text of the bill is available here .
