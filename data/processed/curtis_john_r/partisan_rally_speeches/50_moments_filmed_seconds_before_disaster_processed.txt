we rarely stop to think about how fragile our everyday world really is, but sometimes just one second separates an ordinary day from disaster. watch our new episode until the end, ahead are the most intense and unpredictable moments captured just a split second before catastrophe. let us go! sadly, this is one of those cases where a woman behind the wheel accidently has been significantly reinforced a stereotype. still, no serious harm done. if you are taking a risk, take it alone. why drag someone into danger who did not even choose to be part of it? he was ready for off-roading, but not for a whirlpool. he was skiing down a mountain side by side with an avalanche and still made it out unharmed. the phrase unexpected turn on the road just got a whole new meaning. this route turned out to be more like a survival test. the little fish kept taunting him, but in the end, the reward came. this catch made all the previous disappointment worth it. mission accomplished, but hard to imagine what the camera operator went through hanging by a thread. after a giant chunk of ice nearly fell on her head, she looked up, maybe to see where the danger came from, maybe to give thanks for avoiding it. now instead of a covered facility, there is an open air pool, not according to plan though. he might deliver the cars, but what shape they will be in when they arrive is anyone who is guess. a regular drive nearly turned into a crash, but lightning fast reflexes saved the day. it is painfully frustrating when the first and last launch of a new yacht happen at the same time. this one bridge plus one reminder that nature is stronger than it seems. the demolition was so successful, the neighboring building vanished along with it. everyone at this intersection got a free adrenaline rush and a generous dose of divine luck. it is in moments like this you realize why insurance matters and why it is good to have someone nearby you can rely on. the deer entered the road like it was scripted, completely out of nowhere, but fate gave it a chance. from the showdown between a bike and a train, there is really no suspense. after watching clips like this, you start to think maybe using the ladder is not such a bad idea. it feels like the pool decided it was too confined and tried to prove it was meant for more. and we are moving on at the speed of light. all the most interesting things are still ahead. even rushing to help would not have changed anything so he simply filmed it to remember. when machinery gets out of control, the driver can only fight for control and everyone else must react instantly and hope for the best. the wheel just started its second life and already sparked some trouble. he had just started bragging about his gentle smart cat when he decided to reveal her full demonic side. when his friends sent him for food they forgot one thing, balance is not his strong suit. we have to admit in sports he did definitely hold his own, that reaction and coordination are top nudge. the renovation was finished long ago, complaints no longer accepted, now it is the apartment owners problem. this situation clearly shows how crucial it is to stay focused while driving and strictly follow traffic rules. like food presentation is becoming more popular in restaurants worldwide but show or not, it is a little too soon to forget about safety protocols. trusting experience is second nature but all it takes is one miscalculation and all that confidence disappears along with the truck's roof. they got so caught up in the argument they forgot where they were a few more seconds and they would have been shouting under the wheels. one minute you are walking peacefully through the woods and the next you are in a thriller scene. not everyone gets to see a glacier collapse and definitely not everyone walks away safely when it happens up close. in basketball everything can change in a second and often it is the final shot that wins it. at first the ball was uncontrollable then it became her greatest support. if that is not pure luck then the guy definitely knows what he is doing. talent no doubt. looks how he did not even understand how he pulled that off. one of those tricks that is nearly impossible to repeat but when it works you feel like a champion. on paper it was simple, lift the bed, dump the load, drive away, in reality an unexpected finale worthy of a show. a tractor on water sounds like a challenge to physics and it seemed like it was going to plan until it became obvious the plan was bad. what an incredible footage. we always strive to choose the best content for you. roof sorry gift to strong winds and for repair crews a guaranteed emergency call. after seeing this you might lose the desire to ever drive past a wind farm again. they decided to skip the professionals and quite literally brought everything crashing down. some bridges seem designed not just for crossing but as a final exam for truck drivers. it is amazing how calmly people keep relaxing as if a massive cloud of dust is just part of the show and a landslide is not dangerous. every team has that one person who is morning arrival already hints at disaster. one wrong move and he would have gone over the edge with that boulder. racers already walk a razor's edge on every turn but it is much worse when at the most critical moment the equipment fails. so much rush and desperate effort to extinguish the fire and all of it in vain. what a twist. have not you expected to see this either have you? imagine that his only navigator is instinct he did not bother looking around a big mistake. this is a clear reminder why cleaning your roof in time really matters. maybe the stunt was not perfect but the ending was so cinematic it felt like it was meant to happen. a split second and she could have lost a car door or more but to her it seemed like just a minor hiccup. he hesitated but in the end he bet on luck and guessed right. that fall could have meant months of repairs but the tree decided to be polite. the avalanche gave a gentle warning maybe do not ski here he understood just in time. the cave was treacherous but thankfully only the flashlight fell not the explorer. despite everything nature throws at us there are still those who do not hesitate to fight and save those in trouble. to be honest i am speechless after witnessing it. what about you? i cannot even catch it. using bowling is easy, try copying him. this smartphone clearly is not one to give up easily the eaves will have to look for easier targets. desperate times call for desperate measures, but probably best not to copy this guy. while some only see garbage, others find treasure, luck hides in the most unexpected places. truck drivers have seen it all, but even they were not ready for a road that turns into an ice rink. sometimes moving out is not your decision, it is gravity's. this is not just sparking anymore, it is on the brink of exploding. the cameraman, luckily, was unharmed, now the real challenge is finding the right words for the report. water is mesmerizing, except when it looks like it is about to swallow you whole. he probably always do those nimble hands with one day you land him a true prize. makes you wonder, did the chicken know it laid something truly one of a kind? it was so cool! it is hard to comprehend how this is even possible. thousands of tries, millions of coins, and finally a winner, a day when luck truly answered the call. only someone with true love for sweets and total faith in them could catch luck like this. sometimes one gesture is all it takes to feel, fate is smiling at you today. but from a nightstand and the screen cracked, this time it sank and not a scratch, pure magic, or lottery luck. where one gave up, another took the risk and did not regret it. fate favors the bold. today it really looks like he got lucky, now he just has to decide who to thank, his instincts or someone above. time for a good start to fly, that is what it is to miss! what is your fella's, what is your fellas? far from fellows. finals, pounds! if you have not liked this episode yet, now is the best time to do it. it is doubtful his job description included cutting branches right next to life power lines. it was just a normal peaceful day, nothing for shadow trouble, but in a flash, everything changed. explosion, smoke, screams, panic, that moment when there is no time left to think. you just run. someone else might have panicked, she saw an opportunity and captured a once in a lifetime shot. looks like this dog has its own guardian angel, attentive and perfectly on time. double hit with a single strike, judging by his face, he did not expect that either. she just walked up to the gate, unaware that a predator lurked right behind her. sometimes true luck is when you never even realize what you were just saved from. it looks like the waves decided to give a warning. watch your stuff, next time there might be no jokes. this girl clearly knows all about timing and how to use it flawlessly. she may have seen her life flash before her eyes, but she now knows for sure her guardian angels do not sleep. he probably had no idea he could break the glass, though, to be fair, common sense may have taken a short break. sometimes it feels like you are fixing something, but in reality you have just opened up a whole new problem. at first everyone was simply watching and then it became clear this was not a show, it was a real time disaster, a moment of silence just before the wave hit everyone. we are sure that our episode has impressed you. in fact, we always strive to choose the best ones for you, and we want to thank our regular subscribers and warmly welcome new ones.
