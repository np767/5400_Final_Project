[congressional record volume 162, number 10 (tuesday, january 19, 2016)] [senate] [page s87] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] terrorist attacks against india mr. cornyn. mr. president, i condemn the recent terrorist attack on the indian pathankot air force station, which took the lives of seven indian security force personnel, as well as the attack on the indian consulate in mazar-e-sharif, afghanistan. these deplorable acts of aggression threaten to undermine india's security and also its peaceful activities in afghanistan, which are in the interests of both nations, as well as the united states. it is my understanding that a pakistan-based terrorist group is likely responsible for the attack, and it is imperative that these terrorists be brought to justice. the united states must stand shoulder-to-shoulder with india in facing this common security threat. as violent, islamic extremism emanating from pakistan continues to threaten the long-term stability of the region, it is increasingly important that pakistan reject such aggression and do everything in its power to root out and eliminate these terrorists. ____________________
