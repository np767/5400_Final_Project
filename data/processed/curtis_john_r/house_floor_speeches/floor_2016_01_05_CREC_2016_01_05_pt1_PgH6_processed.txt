[congressional record volume 162, number 2 (tuesday, january 5, 2016)] [house] [page h6] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring kevin kline and the snowdrop foundation (mr. olson asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. olson. mr. speaker, in the movie ``forrest gump,'' tom hanks runs for over 3 years. a good friend of mine is like forrest gump. his name is kevin kline. he is a dj on the 93q morning radio show. his partners, erica rico and tim tuttle, call him kevin gump or forrest kline. why? because for 55 hours over new year's, kevin and others ran, walked, or crawled to save kids with cancer. with his wife, trish, kevin started the snowdrop foundation because cancer touched a 16-year-old, who lost her life, named chelsey campbell. snowdrop has raised over $1 million in just 9 short years. they did this to ensure no child or parent hears those three awful words, ``you have cancer.'' all texans are proud of kevin and trish and snowdrop. to quote kevin's idol: ``that is all i have to say about that.'' ____________________
