[congressional record volume 162, number 2 (tuesday, january 5, 2016)] [house] [page h5] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] background checks for gun ownership (mr. clyburn asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. clyburn. mr. speaker, i rise in support of president obama's announcement today to fight the growing epidemic of gun violence in america and make our families more secure and communities safer. it is just common sense that background checks should be required before an individual is allowed to buy a firearm, yet congress refuses to pass legislation to close loopholes that allow gun sales to proceed before background checks are completed. under the so-called charleston loophole that contributed to the mass murder of nine of my constituents, sales can proceed after 3 days, even when the background check is not complete. that is just wrong. my bill, the background check completion act, will ensure that background checks are completed before sales take place. i thank the president for his leadership today, and i call on my colleagues, many of whom seem to default to ``no,'' no matter how reasonable the proposed legislation may be, when all else fails, employ common sense. ____________________
