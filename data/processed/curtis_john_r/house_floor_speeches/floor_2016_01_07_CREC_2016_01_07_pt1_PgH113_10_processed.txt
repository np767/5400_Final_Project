[congressional record volume 162, number 4 (thursday, january 7, 2016)] [house] [pages h113-h114] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of energy to import highly enriched liquid nuclear waste (mr. higgins asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) mr. higgins. mr. speaker, in 2014, the department of energy announced plans to import highly enriched liquid nuclear waste into the country via the busiest northern border crossing and through a major metropolitan area. this route was approved 20 years ago, pursuant to a pre-9/11 analysis, and for [[page h114]] a less dangerous type of nuclear waste. yet, the department has refused to undertake a contemporary environmental review or threat assessment. in response, this house passed legislation by a vote of 416-0, requiring a threat assessment of a potential terror attack on such cargo. yet, the department of energy announced that it intends to ignore the clear will of this house and authorize 150 truck shipments this year without conducting the threat assessment this house demanded. mr. speaker, this route was a bad idea when it was first approved 20 years ago. disregarding the terror threat, which has increased since then, is dangerously negligent, and we will not stand by while our communities are at risk. ____________________
