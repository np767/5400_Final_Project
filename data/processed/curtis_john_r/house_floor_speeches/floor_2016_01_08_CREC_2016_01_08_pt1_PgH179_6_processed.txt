[congressional record volume 162, number 5 (friday, january 8, 2016)] [house] [page h179] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] violating the constitution is not the answer (mr. mullin asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) mr. mullin. mr. speaker, i rise today because the constitution is under attack by a president who has never respected the second amendment. gun ownership is a fundamental right of law-abiding americans. the supreme court affirmed this right in 2010, and yet this week the president issued new executive actions that are unconstitutional and a clear abuse of power. there is no question that we must stop senseless acts of violence, but violating the constitution is not the answer. criminals are criminals because they break the law. more laws will not keep guns out of criminals' hands. let us let law enforcement do their job and enforce the laws that we already have. let us let law enforcement address the root cause of the violence. let us look at what is causing it, like radicalism and mental illness. i have no doubt that the president's latest actions will be challenged in court. i will do everything in my power to protect oklahoma's rights and the rights of all americans. the speaker pro tempore (mr. rodney davis of illinois). the chair will remind members to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the president. while members may criticize the president's policies or official actions, they may not engage in personal attacks. ____________________
