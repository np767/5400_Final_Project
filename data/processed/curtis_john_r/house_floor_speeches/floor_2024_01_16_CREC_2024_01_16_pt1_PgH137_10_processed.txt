nebraska. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from nebraska? there was no objection. mr. smith of nebraska. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, the legislation before us today, the moving americans privacy protection act, takes an important step to protect the privacy of all americans, especially our veterans and servicemembers returning from overseas. it requires customs and border protection to remove personally identifiable information from any shipping manifest before cbp makes the manifest information available to the public. under current law, customs and border protection is required to make certain shipping manifest information available for public disclosure. unfortunately, there is no requirement to ensure these manifests do not contain americans' personal information. instead, u.s. citizens returning home from military postings or job opportunities abroad are expected to navigate a complicated and bureaucratic system--that often experiences significant delays, i might add--to request that any personal information be removed from manifests to protect their identity from fraudsters and scammers. our brave men and women in uniform, as well as americans whose employers or family commitments have required them to relocate overseas, already face numerous hurdles when they return home. ensuring u.s. customs and border protection proactively removes this data from manifests is a simple, straightforward, and actually long overdue step to protect their identities. i applaud representatives michael waltz and bill pascrell for their leadership on this legislation and senators daines, stabenow, and peters for leading this effort in the senate. i urge my colleagues in the house of representatives to follow the ways and means committee's lead and unanimously pass this bipartisan legislation. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pascrell. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 1568, the bipartisan moving americans privacy protection act. i believe that privacy is something we are going to be discussing on this floor for the next 10 years. we are trying to catch up to the electronics that exist in our lives, and we want to make sure that people are all respected. we know protecting privacy is a difficult and constantly evolving challenge. this is especially true in our modern world. privacy is deeply important for all americans, particularly our servicemembers abroad. unfortunately, our troops are often victims of identity theft. for security purposes, u.s. customs and border protection requires manifest sheets to document the cargo of incoming vessels. the moving americans privacy protection act will ensure that personal data on cargo manifests cannot be abused. i am proud to co-lead this crucial and commonsense measure with the gentleman from florida (mr. waltz). in recent years, manifest data has been mistakenly exposed, enabling identity theft, credit card fraud, and unwanted solicitations. our plan will protect americans from having their personal information compromised. we must make sure information like names, addresses, social security numbers, and passport numbers can be removed from cargo manifests before they are disclosed. this is a no-brainer. we are talking about protecting people's privacy, including servicemembers and their families serving abroad. mr. speaker, i include in the record two letters of support for the moving americans privacy protection act: the first is from the new jersey warehouse and movers association; the second is from the american trucking associations and a coalition of supportive organizations. new jersey warehouse & movers association september 11, 2023. hon. bill pascrell, washington, dc. representative pascrell: as the leader of the new jersey warehouse & movers association, i have the privilege of representing moving and storage companies located across the garden state. thank you for your continued leadership, especially as a member of the us house ways & means committee. our members especially thank you for introducing, along with representative mike walz, the bipartisan moving americans privacy protection act (``mappa'' / hr 1568). as you know, this legislation would help protect the privacy and personally identifiable information (pii) of american servicemembers, federal employees, private sector workers, and their families who are returning to the united states after living abroad. with multiple defense and government installations, more than a dozen fortune 500 corporate headquarters, globally recognized colleges and universities, and its status as a center for international trade, new jersey residents frequently move overseas and then return to the us. this exchange plays an important role in our state's continued economic growth, and the moving industry is proud to support these individuals and their families. unfortunately, current government policy regarding the security of their pii unwittingly places them at risk of identity theft, financiat fraud, and other crimes. the mappa would change this policy and require us customs to remove the pii contained in vessel manifests from trade data that is provided to sale. passage of legislation accomplishing the goal of the mappa has been a long-standing priority of the moving industry. we are thankful for introducing identical legislation in the house (hr 1568) and the senate (s 758). the senate passed s 758 in march 2023, making house approval the only step necessary before the legislation goes to the white house for the president's signature. as such, the new jersey moving industry asks you to contact house ways and means committee ranking member richard neal and urge him to support the committee, including s 758 as passed by the senate in the next available markup, to approve the legislation without amendment, and for the house to consider the legislation under suspension of the rules. we also understand that rep. waltz is testifying in support of mappa during the ways and means committee's ``member day'' hearing on september 14, 2023--joint testimony in support of the legislation or a letter of support for the legislation submitted for the hearing's record would be appreciated as we all work to enact this necessary and commonsense legislation. thank you again for your leadership on this important issue. may 24, 2023. hon. jason smith, chairman, committee on ways and means, washington, dc. hon. adrian smith, chairman, subcommittee on trade, committee on ways and means, washington, dc. hon. richard neal, ranking member, committee on ways and means, washington, dc. hon. earl blumenauer, ranking member, subcommittee on trade, committee on ways and means, washington, dc. dear chairman j. smith, ranking member neal, chairman a. smith, and ranking member blumenauer: our organizations respectfully request committee sign off for house consideration--under suspension of the rules as a stand-alone bill--the moving americans privacy protection act (s. 758), as passed by the senate on march 9, 2023. the legislation addresses a specific and unique issue and helps protect the sensitive personal data of servicemembers, federal employees, private sector workers. and families who are returning to the united states after living abroad. s. 758 was introduced on a bipartisan basis by senators daines, peters, stabenow, and marshall and passed the senate by voice vote. it has a bipartisan house companion (h.r. 1568) introduced by representatives waltz and pascrell. the legislation is identical to the moving americans privacy protection act (115th--h.r. 4403), which in 2018 the ways & means committee reported out by voice vote, followed by house passage under the suspension calendar. the congressional budget office and joint tax committee have determined a ``zero'' score for the legislation. each year, the u.s. military, federal departments, and private sector organizations relocate tens of thousands of americans back home to the u.s. after posting overseas. other americans return home after time abroad for personal reasons. when shipping their personal household goods to the u.s., these individuals must include elements of personally identifiable information [[page h139]] (pii) on shipping forms which are made part of vessel manifests. the pii often contains social security numbers, passport numbers, home addresses, and other sensitive data. currently u.s. customs and border protection (cbp) is required to make all commercial information from vessel manifests--often capturing the sensitive pii of returning american citizens--available to data brokers who package and resell this data throughout their subscriber network. without concrete action to protect the pii, normally held under strict security by the u.s. government, these elements can be exposed, placing americans at risk of identity theft, financial fraud, and other abuses of their data. the moving americans privacy protection act helps protect americans from this risk by ensuring pii is removed from manifests prior to cbp providing and selling the commercial manifest information to data brokers. while it does not amend other provisions of the tariff act or in any other way modify customs, authorities or trade policy, it does remove the u.s. government from making sensitive pii of servicemembers and other americans available to potential criminals as citizens move back home to the united states. given the focused nature of this legislation and increase in identity theft crimes in recent years, we urge the committee to agree to direct house consideration of the senate-passed version of the moving americans privacy protection act (s. 758) as a stand-alone bill under suspension of the rules. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, american trucking associations, international association of movers, military officers association of america, senior executives association, worldwide erc . mr. pascrell. mr. speaker, i strongly encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense measure today. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of nebraska. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from florida (mr. waltz), an expert on this topic. mr. waltz. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of my bill, h.r. 1568, the moving americans privacy protection act. this bipartisan, bicameral bill will require u.s. customs and border protection, cbp, to remove personally identifiable information, including social security and passport numbers, from cargo manifests before they are disclosed to the public. currently, cbp requires manifest sheets, which include pii, in order to disclose and document the cargo of incoming vessels for customs and security purposes. now, originally, the intent of this requirement was to increase competition. it was to facilitate better public analysis of import trends. it was to allow port authorities and transportation companies to more easily identify potential customers and changes in their industry. {time} 1645 like many things we do here, it had a viable and good intent. however, in recent years, the pii of relocating individuals has, again, been publicly released. that has enabled identity theft. it has enabled credit card fraud and unwanted solicitations. importantly, from a national security standpoint, the disclosure allows our adversaries, from terrorist organizations to foreign intelligence organizations of our adversaries like china, russia, and iran, to easily access the pii of our servicemembers and their families as they move around the globe to keep this great nation free. the personal identification, mr. speaker, of every american should be safe and secure, but due to the current public disclosure of cargo manifests, our servicemembers and their families are experiencing a higher risk of identity theft, fraud, and targeting as they move abroad in service of our nation. it is critical that we take the necessary steps to protect them from this dangerous and fraudulent activity. the moving americans privacy protection act is essential to protect the private information not only of our servicemembers but of all americans. i thank ways and means chairman jason smith, democrat co-lead, representative pascrell, and particularly the ways and means staff for their hard work and working with my team to move this bill through committee and to the full house for consideration. i look forward to passage by the full house. i encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, and i look forward to working with senator daines, in particular, in the senate to get this important bill signed into law. mr. pascrell. mr. speaker, protecting the privacy of the american people must be our priority. i strongly urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. smith of nebraska. mr. speaker, my colleagues have sufficiently described the details of this bill, why we need to do it, and that we should do it immediately. i certainly urge my colleagues to support it so that we can get this done, especially to assist our men and women in uniform. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from nebraska (mr. smith) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1568, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. smith of nebraska. mr. speaker, i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. the point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. ____________________
