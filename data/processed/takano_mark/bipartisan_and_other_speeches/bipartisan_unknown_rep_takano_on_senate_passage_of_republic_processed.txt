home newsroom press releases july 01, 2025 rep. takano on senate passage of republican spending bill washington, d.c. – today, rep. mark takano (ca-39), released the following statement after the senate passed the republican reconciliation bill, sending the legislation back to the house for final passage: “the republican spending bill is nothing more than a cruel giveaway to the powerful at the expense of everyday americans. it slashes programs that help our neighbors meet their most basic needs—gutting snap, cutting medicaid, and pushing hospitals, especially in rural areas, toward closure. “these are lifelines for working families, seniors, and the most vulnerable among us. at the same time, the bill showers the ultra-wealthy with new tax breaks, proving once again that this legislation serves billionaires. “this isn’t governing. it’s grifting. this bill may be wrapped in populist packaging—but its contents are painfully clear: giveaways for the powerful, and devastation for the rest of us.” “i voted against this bill before when house republicans used the cover of darkness to pass these cuts, and i will do it again.” print email share tweet previous article next article
