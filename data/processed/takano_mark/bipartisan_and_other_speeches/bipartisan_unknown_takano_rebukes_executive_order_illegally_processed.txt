home newsroom press releases march 20, 2025 takano rebukes executive order illegally dismantling the department of education washington, d.c. — representative mark takano (ca-39) , a former public school teacher and senior member of the house education and workforce committee, released the following statement following president trump signing an executive order directing secretary mcmahon to begin illegally dismantling the department of education: “secretary mcmahon has been directed to deny american students their right to a free and fair education,” said rep. takano. “it is impossible to complete the work the department of education is charged to do with a fraction of the resources and a fraction of the staff. eliminating that work will cause our most vulnerable students to suffer, deepening the dividebetween the haves and the have-nots. “make no mistake, the voucherzation, privatization, and the elimination of public schools will hurt those who have the most to gain from a public education. it will hurt young people, their families, communities, business and industry, national security and destroy our ability to compete globally. “donald trump is trying to con the american people into cutting public education to fund another tax break to billionaires. it’s a deal only a convicted con man would force on our country. but my colleagues and i are fighting back to ensure that the american people have their voices heard. “i call on my republicans colleagues to join me and use their voice. they need to use their voice on behalf of the students and teachers in their district. they know this decision will hurt their communities, they know this will hurt our country’s future; the question is if they are too scared of elon musk and trump than to speak up and object.” ### print email share tweet previous article next article
