home newsroom press releases november 04, 2025 inland empire lawmakers spotlight impact of trump’s imminent snap cuts on 42 million americans at riverside food bank riverside, ca – today, members of the inland empire congressional delegation— reps. mark takano (ca-39), pete aguilar (ca-33), raul ruiz (ca-25), and norma torres (ca-35) —gathered at a local food bank that distributes food across riverside and san bernardino counties to spotlight the impact of the trump administration’s refusal to distribute november’s supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap) benefits for 42 million americans. earlier this year, trump and republicans cut $186 billion from snap in the “one big ugly bill.” now, during the government shutdown, they are delaying and shrinking november benefits despite the trump administration’s own september shutdown plan stating that they would continue to fund snap during a shutdown. members toured the food bank and highlighted the impact of trump’s snap cuts on working americans. “our message today to president trump is simple; stop using hunger as a weapon,” said congressman mark takano . “families, seniors, and veterans should never have to wonder whether politics will decide whether they can eat. our ask is clear: restart snap benefits now as the judge ordered and come to the negotiating table so we can save health care and reopen the government.” “the trump administration has reached a new level of cruelty by refusing to fund snap and allowing millions of children and families to go hungry,” said congressman pete aguilar. “republicans have no problem finding $40 billion in taxpayer dollars to bail out billionaire investors in argentina, but when it comes to ensuring the most vulnerable americans don’t go hungry, they drag their feet to find funding despite the fact that there is money available for the program. donald trump and his republican henchmen must do the right thing: fully fund snap, open the government, and save health care. the american people are depending on them.” “american families are facing the largest cut to snap in history—$186 billion—and this shutdown is only making hunger worse. it took states like california suing the trump administration just to force the release of emergency snap funds so families could eat during thanksgiving,” said congressman raul ruiz, m.d. “in california’s 25th district, where 42% of families rely on snap, the stakes couldn’t be higher. speaker johnson needs to stop canceling work and do his job. i’ll keep fighting to reopen the government, protect snap, safeguard health care, and lower costs for hardworking families.” “the trump administration is using hunger as a weapon, and i won’t stand for it. cutting snap means taking food out of children’s mouths and punishing working families who are already struggling to survive,” said congresswoman norma torres . “nearly a million people in the inland empire depend on these benefits to feed their families. taking food away from them is cruel and unacceptable, and i will not stop until every family gets the support they’ve earned and deserve.” footage of the press conference can be found here . ### print email share tweet previous article next article
