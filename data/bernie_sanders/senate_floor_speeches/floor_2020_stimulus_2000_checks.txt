And I have the strong feeling that the people of Kentucky will respond no differently than the people of Vermont or New York."This last poll that I saw, it had 78 percent of the American people saying that they wanted and needed that type of help. But this discussion frankly is not just about the economic struggling of working families in this country, it's not just the massive levels of income and wealth inequality, it's about basic democracy.Read MoreBernie Sanders Uses Trump Tweet to Bash GOP on Senate Floor: ‘President Is Right!’3 min readBernie Sanders Tells Mitch McConnell to Ask Kentucky Families How They Feel About $2K Checks3 min readMcConnell Accuses Dems of Bullying After Kentucky Gov Endorses $2,000 Stimulus Checks4 min read"What we have to do here on the floor, whether it's Senator Schumer or Senator McConnell or me, we have got to talk in legalese, that's the language of the United States Senate and the stuff sounds pretty complicated to the average person."But all that Senator Schumer and I are asking of the majority leader is a very simple request; allow the members of the United States Senate to cast a vote."If you want to vote against $2,000 checks for people in your state, vote against it. I see Senator Toomey has been clear about it. I suspect he will vote against it, I respect his opinion, but all that we are asking for is a vote. What is the problem?"In the house over two-thirds of the members of that body including 44 Republicans, voted to say that at this time of economic desperation, working families deserve help and they deserve a $2,000 check and as Senator Schumer just indicated, we have a very unlikely ally in President Trump."Nobody here will disagree with Trump more times than I have and yet here is what the leader of the Republican Party says. He says '$2,000 ASAP'."So even on this issue. Amazingly enough, the president of the United States is right. So what all of this comes down to, my fellow Americans, is not even whether you agree with Senator Schumer or myself and 78 percent of the American people, or you agree with Senator McConnell, and I suspect Senator Toomey, that's fine, it's called democracy, we have differences of opinion."All that I am asking is give us a vote. What's the problem? Allow the United States senators to cast a vote as to whether or not they are for the $2,000 check or whether they are against it...."We will need, as I understand, 60 votes to win. That's a big hurdle. I don't know that we are going to win. There are a number of Republicans who to their credit have said they are ready to vote for it. I suspect there may be more and when given the opportunity who will vote for it. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe we will lose and I think that would be unfortunate."All that I'm asking for right now is give us the opportunity to vote. What is the problem with that? So Mr. President, with that I will now go to Senate legalese and say, quote: "I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday December 31, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 9051 to provide a $2,000 direct payment to the working class, that the bill be considered read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill without intervening action or debate."Further, that if passed, the motion to reconsider, be considered, made and laid upon the table."Further, that immediately following the vote on H.R. 9051, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of the veto message on H.R. 6395, that the Senate immediately vote on passage of the bill, the objections to the president to the contrary notwithstanding, with no intervening action or debate."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesAdd Newsweek as a preferred source on Google to see more of our trusted coverage when you search.Recommended For YouPoliticsDonald Trump Reacts To Ted Cruz Presidential Run Rumors4 min readPoliticsDonald Trump’s MAGA Succession Plan Could Be Under Threat5 min readU.S.Americans Warned As New Type of Economy Spells Trouble5 min readPoliticsDemocrats Let Kansas Governor Laura Kelly Lead—Now They’re Winning12 min readPoliticsDemocrat Says More Jeffrey Epstein Emails Expected5 min readNewsThomas Massie a Little ‘Suspicious’ of Trump Reversal on Epstein Files6 min readRelated PodcastsTop StoriesPoliticsDonald Trump’s MAGA Succession Plan Could Be Under Threat5 min readPoliticsTrump Approval Rating Hits New Low Amid Epstein, Affordability Fallout—Poll2 min readPoliticsWill Epstein Files Be Released?
