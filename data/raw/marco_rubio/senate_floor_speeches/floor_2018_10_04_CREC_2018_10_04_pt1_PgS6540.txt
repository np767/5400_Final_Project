TRIBUTE TO CHARLOTTE WEBER
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I recognize Charlotte Weber
for being named the National Breeder of the Year by the Thoroughbred
Owners and Breeders Association.
The Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association presented Charlotte
with this award during the 33rd annual national awards dinner at the
Woodford Reserve Club in Lexington, KY. She is the owner and sole
operator of Live Oak Stud in Ocala, and for the first time, a broodmare
based outside of Kentucky received this recognition.
Live Oak Stud is a 4,500-acre thoroughbred farm and commercial cattle
operation that Charlotte has guided since 1995. Her breeding and racing
operation's distinctive black, red, and white silks have become a
nationally recognized racing symbol. Over the years, Live Oak Stud has
seen its record of success grow. Charlotte's horse, Win Approval, dam
of World Approval, was also named Broodmare of the Year by the
Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association. This horse has become a
central part of Live Oak Stud's success.
I extend my best wishes to Charlotte and look forward to hearing of
Live Oak Stud's continued success as she brings prestige to Florida
horse breeding.
