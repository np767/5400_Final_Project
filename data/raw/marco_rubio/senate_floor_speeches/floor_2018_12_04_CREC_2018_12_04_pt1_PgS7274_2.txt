RECOGNIZING FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I recognize the Florida State
University Women's soccer team on securing its second NCAA National
Championship, becoming one of six schools in NCAA women's soccer
history to win multiple championships. Head coach Mark Krikorian led
the Florida State team to the 2018 College Cup for the ninth time in
his 14 seasons at Florida State, including four appearances in the
national championship game. FSU defeated each of the last three
national champions in the 2018 tournament on the way to the title,
delivering a stunning end to Stanford University's 45-match unbeaten
streak in the semifinal game. In the championship game against the
University of North Carolina, Dallas Dorosy scored the game's only goal
on a pass from Deyna Castellanos, in the 60th minute. This NCAA title
complements the team's 2018 Atlantic Coast Conference championship win,
the sixth in the past 8 years.
I extend warm congratulations on their hard-earned national
championship to players Caroline Jeffers, Megan Connolly, Kristina
Lynch, Anna Patten, Jaelin Howell, Dallas Dorosy, Kirsten Pavlisko,
Deyna Castellanos, Gloriana Villalobos, Kaycie Tillman, Taylor Hallmon,
Natalia Kuikka, Olivia Bergau, Gabby Carle, Malia Berkley, Macayla
Edwards, Kristen McFarland, Alexa Orrante, Bella Dorosy, Makala Thomas,
Emily Madril, Clara Robbins, Yujie Zhao, and Brooke Bollinger, as well
as head coach Mark Krikorian, assistant coach Mike Bristol, assistant
coach Morinao Imaizumi, and director of operations Nathan
Minion.
