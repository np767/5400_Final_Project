TRIBUTE TO ELIJAH COLE BATSON
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I recognize Elijah Cole
Batson, a 2018 summer intern in my Orlando office, for all of the hard

diligent worker who has been devoted to getting the most out of his
internship experience.
I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Elijah
