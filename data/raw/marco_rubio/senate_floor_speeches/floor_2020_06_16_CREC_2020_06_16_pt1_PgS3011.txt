RECOGNIZING BEST MEMORIES ACADEMY
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as chairman of the Senate
Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize
a small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit
at the heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a woman-
owned small business that provides an enriching environment for
children and serves a diverse community. This week, it is my pleasure
to honor Best Memories Academy of Orlando, FL, as the Senate Small
Business of the Week.
For 20 years, Best Memories Academy has provided quality childcare
for families in Orlando, FL. When her son was 2 years old, Lyana
Vazquez, originally from Puerto Rico, began searching for a daycare
program that would provide instruction in English and Spanish, but
options were limited in the Orlando area. Undeterred, Lyana founded
Best Memories Academy, to provide daycare and preschool programs with
an emphasis on bilingual education.

Over the years, Best Memories Academy has expanded its services.
Lyana developed a bilingual curriculum and built strong relationships
with Orlando's growing Latino community. She hired educators who spoke
English and Spanish, incorporating the LENA Grow Program into their
training. This research-based program enabled staff to begin
conversational language teaching during critical stages of language
learning. In 2019, Best Memories Academy began offering kindergarten
and first grade instruction in addition to voluntary prekindergarten
and after-school care. They partnered with the Early Learning Coalition
of Orange County, ELCOC, to host educational workshops and community
outreach events, becoming one of the premier daycare centers in the
area.
Like many other small businesses, Best Memories Academy experienced a
sharp decline in revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic. As student
enrollment dropped, Lyana modified her business operations to comply
with the latest best practices from the Center for Disease Control,
Florida Department of Health, and Florida Department of Children and
Families. Together, she and her team assembled and dropped remote-
learning packets for students, taking special care with the materials
for children whose families lacked internet access. Despite the
challenges, Lyana was determined to stay open to care for the children
of essential workers and keep her employees paid.
When the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck
Protection Program PPP, Lyana immediately applied. The PPP provides
forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and nonprofits who
maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nine days after
she submitted an application, Best Memories Academy received funding
for a PPP loan in early April. As a result, Lyana was able to keep her
12 employees paid and keep her business open until Florida began to
reopen and students returned. For Lyana and her team, the Paycheck
Protection Program didn't just provide a salary--it provided hope.
Best Memories Academy is a notable example of the role of
relationship-driven small businesses in building community. I commend
their work to provide high-quality bilingual education to children
ranging from infancy to elementary school. Congratulations to Lyana and
the entire team at Best Memories Academy. I look forward to watching
your continued growth and success in the Orlando area.
