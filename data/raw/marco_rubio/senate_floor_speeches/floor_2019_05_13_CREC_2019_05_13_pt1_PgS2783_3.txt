TRIBUTE TO LINDSAY BEAM
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I honor Lindsay Beam, the
Calhoun County Teacher of the Year from Blountstown Middle School in
Blountstown, FL.
Lindsay considers her highest priority as an educator is to serve the
needs of her students. She will arrange meetings with them before
school and during her planning time to provide extra tutoring and
support to build up their confidence in math. Her students note she is
the kind of teacher that makes a difference in their lives long after
they have completed her class.
Lindsay began her teaching career in 2010 as a first grade teacher at
Blountstown Elementary School and moved to teaching fifth grade in
2012. Since 2015, she has taught sixth grade math, as well as a portion
of eighth graders at Blountstown Middle School.
I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Lindsay for her work to
teach her students and look forward to hearing of her continued success
in the years to come.
