RECOGNIZING IDEAL ALUMINUM PRODUCTS, LLC
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as chairman of the Senate
Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize
a small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit
at the heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a small
business that is known for excellence in its industry, outstanding
craftsmanship, and creating dignified work in their community. This
week, it is my pleasure to recognize Ideal Aluminum Products, LLC of
St. Augustine, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
In 2010, Michael Siegel and Doug Brady purchased Ideal Aluminum
Products. Based in DeLand, FL, this fence, gate, and railing
manufacturing company had recently gone out of business. Doug, an
alumnus of the University of South Florida, had also worked with
Michael at Ideal Gas, LLC. Together, the two planned to turn this new
company around.
Over the next decade, Michael and Doug grew Ideal Aluminum into an
industry leader. A favorable business environment and proximity to I-95
spurred Ideal Aluminum's relocation to St. Augustine in 2015. Their
success as a local manufacturer and commitment to job creation was
honored by then-Governor Rick Scott, who issued a monthly job report at
their facility in 2016.
Ideal Aluminum has been an ardent supporter of community development.
In 2011, Ideal Aluminum manufactured, donated, and installed railings
for ABC's ``Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.'' They were recognized in
2015 by
[[Page S2648]]
GrowFL, which spotlights businesses that create quality jobs, enrich
their communities, and broaden new industries throughout Florida. Ideal
Aluminum was nominated for the Florida Sterling Manufacturing Business
Award in 2017 for business excellence in Florida's manufacturing
community. Michael and Doug were finalists for the Ernst & Young
Entrepreneur of the Year award in 2017 and 2018. Ideal Aluminum has
also been featured in the St. Augustine Record and industry
publications.
Like many other small businesses, Ideal Aluminum stepped up to help
their community during the coronavirus pandemic. When Michael and Doug
heard about the shortage of blood donations, they organized a blood
drive at Ideal Aluminum and collected donations for Feeding Northeast
Florida. The company matched every dollar collected, resulting in a
$3,000 donation to feed the hungry in the St. Augustine area.
When the U.S. Small Business Administration--SBA--launched the
Paycheck Protection Program--PPP--Michael and Doug applied immediately.
The PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and
nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. In
late April, Ideal Aluminum received a PPP loan and an Economic Injury
Disaster Loan from the SBA. As a result, they were able to keep all of
their employees paid.
Ideal Aluminum Products exemplifies how crucial small businesses are
in creating jobs and building the local community. I commend their
efforts to create jobs in the critical manufacturing sector.
Congratulations to Michael, Doug, and the entire team at Ideal
Aluminum. I look forward to watching your continued growth and
success.
