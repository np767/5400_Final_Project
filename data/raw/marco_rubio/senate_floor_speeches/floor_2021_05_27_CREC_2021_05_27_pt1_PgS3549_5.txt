Automated Vehicles
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, from the beginning, the story of the U.S.
auto industry has been one of ingenuity, of taking risks, and of
pushing forward.
At the dawn of the 20th century, most Americans could hardly
comprehend the idea of the automobile. Yet, 20 years later, they had
become nearly ubiquitous in American life, thanks to the insistence of
entrepreneurs like Henry Ford on making the automobile affordable for
the majority of Americans.
The democratization of the automobile, rather than the invention of
the automobile itself, is, in my opinion, one of most remarkable and
uniquely American success stories.
Automobiles allowed Americans to capitalize on the economic dynamism
of the roaring twenties and helped Americans move and adapt during the
Great Depression.
They contributed greatly to the American industrial base and the
know-how needed to fight and win the Second World War and help propel
the United States to its current status as a preeminent global economic
and military power.
Visionary investments like the Interstate Highway System made cars a
staple in American economic and cultural life. And cars certainly made
it a lot easier to get to and from rural America. In a place like rural
South Dakota, with limited public transportation, the automobile, often
a pickup or an SUV, is typically the only way to get around.
Today, the automobile industry stands on the brink of a new
technological revolution, which promises to dramatically transform
mobility once again.
Over the past three decades, the internet has transformed our economy
and our way of life, and the next generation of the internet, 5G, which
is currently being deployed across the Nation, will enable a host of
new innovations, including a revolution in vehicle technology:
automated vehicles or what we call AVs.
AVs will change the way that we move in numerous ways, making the
transportation system safer, more efficient, and more accessible.
Individuals whose mobility is currently limited, for example,
Americans with disabilities, could gain new independence with the
deployment of automated vehicles, allowing them to work or visit
friends and family safely and easily.
I am proud that my proposed AV amendment to the Endless Frontier Act
was recently endorsed by the National Federation of the Blind, and I
ask for unanimous consent that the letter of endorsement be inserted in
the Record
There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in
the Record, as follows:
National Federation of the Blind,
May 11, 2021.
Hon. Maria Cantwell,
Chair, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, &
Transportation, Washington, DC.
Hon. Roger Wicker,
Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, &
Transportation, Washington, DC.
Dear Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member Wicker: The National
Federation of the Blind, the nation's transformative civil
rights organization of the blind, supports and endorses the
amendment to the Endless Frontier Act filed with the
committee by Senator Thune on May 10, 2021. Specifically, we
support the portions of the amendment that will create an
exemption classification for manufacturers who provide
transportation access for people with disabilities and
prohibit discriminatory licensing practices for highly
automated vehicles.
Subsection (d)(2)(C) of the amendment would create an
exemption category under the federal motor vehicle safety
standards located in Section 30113 of title 49 United States
Code that would ``provide transportation access for
individuals with disabilities, including non-visual access
for individuals who are blind or visually impaired.'' This
addition to the law will provide the incentive needed for
automobile manufacturers to ensure that the unique
requirements for Americans with disabilities to be able to
operate automated vehicles are considered in the early stages
of development.
Subsection (e)(3) of the amendment would mandate that a
state ``may not issue a motor vehicle operator's license for
the operation or use of a highly automated vehicle in a
manner that discriminates on the basis of disability.'' This
will ensure that current requirements necessary to obtain a
driver's license, like a vision test, will not be required in
order to operate or use a highly automated vehicle. We are
pleased to see this subsection included in the amendment
because highly automated vehicles will pilot themselves (SAE
Level 4 and Level 5), making a vision requirement arbitrary
and discriminatory.
Highly automated vehicles have the potential to
revolutionize the transportation landscape, especially for
individuals with disabilities. However, those same
individuals with disabilities who stand to gain the most from
the creation and proliferation of highly automated vehicles
could be left out of this new frontier if specific actions
are not taken. Senator Thune's amendment to the Endless
Frontier Act is an important step to ensure that America's
journey toward automotive automation is fully inclusive of
those who will benefit most.
Sincerely,
Mark A. Riccobono,
President.
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, imagine a farmer in rural South Dakota
who can no longer drive to get to town for appointments, prescriptions,
or groceries--enter the automated vehicle.
This technology has potential to keep people in their homes and
communities longer.
Moreover, AVs have potential to greatly increase roadway safety.
Currently, there are an average of more than 35,000 traffic fatalities
on our Nation's roadways each year, including pedestrian, motorcycle,
and bicycle fatalities. Automated vehicles could dramatically--
dramatically--reduce that number. Distracted driving, driving while
impaired--automated vehicles could eliminate those dangers.
For automated vehicle technology to advance, it is imperative that
the regulatory framework catch up with private-sector innovation. That
is why I have pushed for the enactment of AV legislation over the years
and why I had hoped--I had hoped--that we would be voting to add my
automated vehicles amendment to the legislation before the Senate
today.
I have spent nearly 5 years--5 years--working in a bipartisan manner
on a legislative framework to govern the testing and deployment of
automated vehicles. The amendment I offered to the bill before us today
is an amendment that I had hoped to be able to offer with bipartisan
support. It would have paved the way for expanded testing and
deployment of automated vehicles in the United States under the
oversight of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
And let me emphasize that oversight point. My amendment would ensure
that automated vehicles would not--not--touch pavement without the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's certification that
they are at least as safe as a conventional vehicle. The data gathered
from the vehicles deployed as a result of this amendment would be
crucial to the development of future motor vehicle safety standards for
AVs.
Unfortunately, bipartisan agreement on my amendment collapsed when
special interests expressed their opposition, despite major efforts to
accommodate their concerns. And I am deeply disappointed that, once
again, Democrats yielded to pressure from special interests against the
best interests of our economy and the American people.
Advancing AV technology is not just a vehicle safety issue. It is
also an issue of U.S. leadership and global competitiveness. Investing
in the production of AV technology here in the United States would not
only strengthen the resilience of the auto industry but also the
Nation's industrial base and our national security.
The auto industry touches nearly every American State. For example,
Horton in Britton, SD, manufactures engine cooling systems, providing
steady, good paying jobs for that community and strengthening the local
economy. The same story repeats itself countless times in communities
all across the Nation.
Providing millions of jobs and investing billions annually, the
American auto industry is a critical component of the nation's economy.
Right now,
[[Page S3551]]
U.S. companies lead the world in AV technology, but other nations, like
China, are seizing upon regulatory inaction and striving to take the
lead. If we don't move forward with automated vehicle technology, we
will soon see some other nation leading the AV revolution.
The legislative package before us today is designed to bolster the
global competitiveness of the United States.
It is pretty difficult to understand why this reasonable and, I might
add, no cost AV amendment that would lead to untold benefits for our
Nation's transportation system, does not fit in. How can a bill making
strong investments in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and
advanced manufacturing exclude a legislative framework for AVs?
Are we really going to back down from leading the world in automated
innovation and technology and cede the future of this industry to
nations like China? Will we really ignore the enormous--enormous--
safety benefits of these vehicles just to suit Democrats' political
convenience?
More than a century ago, when the automobile was invented, there were
plenty of skeptics, but America's automobile pioneers did not let that
stop them. They seized the moment and pressed forward and ushered in a
transportation revolution. We can do that again today or we can cede
this moment to nations like China and let the American automobile
industry fall permanently behind. That is the choice in front of us. I
hope we will choose to seize this moment and pass the legislation we
need to usher in another American transportation revolution.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.

SEC. 73006. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON LEADERSHIP AT WORLD TRADE
ORGANIZATION.
(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
(1) The United States had led the formation, as well as
reform, of rules governing the multilateral trading system
since World War II.
(2) The United States is a founding member of the World
Trade Organization (in this section referred to as the
``WTO'') and a key architect of the organization.
(3) The United States secured important commitments in the
WTO to facilitate trade in goods and services, to prevent the
application of non-scientific restrictions on United States
agriculture, and to protect United States intellectual
property.
(4) The United States uses the rules of the WTO to benefit
workers, farmers, fishers, and businesses in the United
States by facilitating access to the 90 percent of the
world's consumers who live outside the borders of the United
States.
(5) The fundamental purpose of the WTO is to create space
for members to negotiate with each other, and the WTO
reserves to those members exclusively the right to negotiate
and adopt rules that reduce and eliminate trade barriers and
discriminatory treatment.
(6) The prompt settlement of disputes in which a member of
the WTO considers that its rights are being impaired by the
actions of another member is essential to the functioning of
the WTO and the maintenance of
[[Page S3570]]
a proper balance between the rights and obligations of
members.
(7) The WTO's dispute settlement function, including in
particular the Appellate Body, has increasingly failed to
enforce the rules of the WTO in a timely manner, and has
usurped the negotiating prerogative of members by creating
new obligations and rights that are inconsistent with or not
included in the rules negotiated by members.
(8) The creation of those obligations and rights
undermines--
(A) the WTO's negotiating function by discouraging members
from making concessions; and
(B) the WTO's dispute settlement function by encouraging
overuse of the process and undermining its legitimacy,
including by preventing free market economies from responding
to globally trade distortive practices by nonmarket
economies.
(9) The WTO does not have sufficient rules to discipline
the distortive economic policies of nonmarket economies, such
as policies relating to excess capacity and forced technology
transfer, the special treatment those economies afford to
state-owned enterprises, and their massive and opaque
industrial subsidies.
(10) There is long-standing bipartisan support in Congress
to reform the WTO to address those failings.
(11) The current presidential administration, as well as
prior administrations, raised concerns about the failings
described in this subsection and have made reform of the WTO
a top priority of United States trade policy.
(12) The United States urges WTO members to work
constructively with the United States to assess the reasons
why the existing WTO rules have proven inadequate in order to
create an atmosphere within the WTO that is conducive to the
development of new rules less subject to jurisprudential
drift.
(13) The guiding principle for reform of the WTO, and the
lens through which WTO members should consider specific
reform proposals, is the restoration of the WTO's capability
and capacity for negotiation among members.
(14) The United States has achieved its trade policy
objectives through active leadership at the WTO, and an
absence of that leadership would be filled by nonmarket
economies that are hostile to a host of United States
interests.
(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
(1) while the United States finds value and usefulness in
the WTO, in order to fulfill the needs of the United States
and other free and open economies in the 21st century,
significant reforms are needed;
(2) the United States must therefore continue to
demonstrate leadership to achieve reforms that restore the
effectiveness of the WTO's--
(A) negotiating function;
(B) dispute settlement function so that it transparently,
efficiently, and fully enforces outcomes negotiated by
members rather than usurping their primacy by creating new
rights or obligations; and
(C) rules for special and differential treatment to ensure
those rules promote advancement for truly developing
countries, rather than becoming tools for globally
competitive countries, like the People's Republic of China,
to engage in protectionism and market distortions;
(3) the efforts to reform the negotiating function of the
WTO should revitalize the negotiating function by providing
confidence to members that the WTO operates according to the
rules as negotiated and adopted by members;
(4) a revitalized negotiating function must include new
rules that reflect the 21st century economy, further combat
anticompetitive and protectionist barriers, and ensure
disputes are efficiently resolved;
(5) the United States Trade Representative should continue
to lead efforts to work with WTO members to pursue reforms at
the WTO that--
(A) ensure the dispute settlement mechanism faithfully
applies the rules adopted by members, including by
undertaking measures to ensure the WTO's Appellate Body does
not create new rights and obligations;
(B) improve public confidence in dispute settlement by
promoting greater transparency and efficiency in the conduct
of proceedings;
(C) redress the consistent failure by certain members to
satisfy their notification obligations under various WTO
agreements, including through measures that strengthen
accountability;
(D) ensure rules for special and differential treatment are
appropriately reserved for countries whose state of
development and global competitiveness actually warrants such
flexibility;
(E) create new rules and structures that can serve the
interests of the United States while promoting peace,
prosperity, good governance, transparency, effective
operation of legal regimes, the rule of law, and free
enterprise; and
(F) expand upon the trilateral negotiations currently
underway with Japan and the European Union; and
(6) the United States Trade Representative should explore
and assess specific reform proposals, including--
(A) pursuing plurilateral agreements that further the
interests of the United States while limiting the benefits
accruing to countries that are not parties to those
agreements;
(B) efforts to ensure that incorrect interpretations by the
Appellate Body, including with respect to the Agreement on
Safeguards, the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, and the
Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, are
corrected, and not to be deemed precedential;
(C) new rules and norms to address practices of nonmarket
economies, such as practices relating to state-owned
enterprises, which certain countries often utilize for
objectives that cause severe trade distortions; and
(D) better implementation of existing rules, such as the
prohibition in paragraph 4 of Article XIV of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on currency manipulation, to
ensure that those rules are effective to preserve the rights
of free market economies.

Mr. CRAPO. Madam President and Members of the Senate, what we are
going to be voting on shortly here, Senate Amendment No. 1562, is an
example of the bipartisanship that can be achieved if we put in the
hard work to work out the details and the differences between us on
very critical issues.
This is not just an amendment on one topic; this is an entire title,
the Finance Committee's title. The chairman of the Finance Committee,
Senator Wyden, and I have worked for months
[[Page S3837]]
together to identify that intersection--which is a big one, as you will
see--between Republicans and Democrats here in the Senate on trade
policy to help us to put together a package of strong trade policy that
will help us to stand up our efforts in pushing back against China in
one of the most critical arenas that we face: trade, our economy, and
working against the very nefarious activities that China is engaged in
to try to undercut us economically and to undercut our American
companies in our trade relationships.
Senator Wyden and I worked hard together to get this done, and I am
glad that we now have a package that can be put forward. As I said, it
is not just one provision; this is an entire trade title. Let me
summarize just some of the things that are in it.
It provides a comprehensive approach to combat China's manufacturing
imbalances, threats to free and fair trade, and illicit activity, which
undermine America's leadership in innovation. This legislation will
level the playing field for American consumers and companies, including
workers, farmers, fishers, families, and taking aim at China's worst
practices.
The amendment itself carries a bipartisan approach into a Senate-wide
effort to ensure that the United States is positioned effectively to
compete on a fair playing field globally--not just with China,
globally, but especially with China.
It bolsters efforts to prohibit goods made with forced labor from
reaching the United States by strengthening our Customs and Border
Protection enforcement efforts and through better use of the Seafood
Import Monitoring Program.
It provides modernized trade enforcement tools to U.S. Trade
Representatives to address anti-competitive digital trade and
censorship practices, like China's great firewall, by requiring the
USTR to identify trading partners that disrupt digital trade.
It appoints a USTR official to oversee information communication
technology and provides advance notice and text of proposals for any
digital trade agreements 5 days before they are tabled to facilitate
our efforts here in Congress to oversee an effective trade policy.
It requires a review of trade in essential supplies, including the
sources of imports, and analysis of any vulnerabilities, as well as
additional tools for businesses in the United States seeking reliable
suppliers.
It strengthens oversight over U.S. trade policy by providing an
inspector general to the USTR and by ensuring the application of
section 301 tariffs related to China are calibrated to provide the
necessary leverage to support American competition while ensuring U.S.
competitiveness in manufacturing.
It reauthorizes, critically, the miscellaneous tariff bill--what has
been called the MTB--and improved generalized system of preferences,
the GSP. That will promote human rights, the environment, women's
economic empowerment, and the rule of law and digital trade, and
restarts and reforms the critical section 301 product exclusion
process. These things might sound complicated, but it is our way of
standing up our American competitors in a very anti-competitive
environment dealing with China.
It expands the duties of the Interagency Center on Trade
Implementation, Monitoring, and Enforcement to include investigations
of practices, diffuse impacts on the economy and workers of the United
States where there is systemic impacts on the resiliency of multiple
critical domestic supply chains. Standing up and building out our
supply chains is critical in this economic competition.
It requires the U.S. Trade Representatives to initiate talks with the
Quad countries to develop a strategy on critical minerals to counter
China's dominant share of that global supply.
It requires the CBP to submit a report to Congress on achieving
supply chain transparency. CBP is seeking greater supply chain
transparency to address merchandise made with forced labor, with
counterfeits, and through a 21st Century Customs Framework Initiative.
It requires the USTR to brief Congress on the findings of a
forthcoming report by the Comptroller General of the United States
related to that critical 301 exclusion process.
It directs the USTR to enter into negotiations with allies to stop
the importation of goods made with stolen intellectual property into
the United States and allied countries. The theft of American
intellectual property is becoming critical to our ability to be
effectively competitive against China.
This list goes on. This is a major Finance Committee title that will
significantly strengthen U.S. competitiveness in response to the malign
activities that we continuously see growing from China. I encourage all
of my colleagues to support this important amendment.
Before I finish, I want to say what I was going to say at the
beginning of my remarks, and I alluded to it briefly. Senator Wyden and
I have had a very close and strong negotiation going on, and I
appreciate deeply the ability that we have to work together in a
bipartisan fashion to build this, and we will be building other very
important policies for this country. I just wanted to thank my
colleague Senator Wyden for his partnership in this effort.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I, too, want to express my appreciation
to Senator Crapo. We are partners in the Senate Finance Committee. As
Senator Crapo really touched on, we know that sometimes around here in
the Senate, it is hard to get Senators to agree on the proper way to
butter a piece of toast. But what Senator Crapo and I have tried to
show--and I believe this amendment does it--is that the Senate is going
to come together on the urgency of outcompeting China, and that is what
our legislation is all about.
Senator Crapo ticked off a number of the key measures. Obviously we
feel very strongly. We spent weeks looking at it in hearings and in
discussions--at how China rips off our intellectual properties, steals
technology, sends dangerous counterfeits to our market, and how it
undercuts manufacturers with overproduction and unfair subsidies. The
fact is, the Chinese have deployed massive subsidies, incentivized
overproduction in key manufacturing sectors like steel, aluminum, and
solar panels, that undercuts our competitors. They have shaken down
American firms for intellectual property and stolen cutting-edge
technology.
Worst of all, colleagues, is the practice of forced labor, which we
looked at in the Senate Finance Committee. It is morally repugnant on
its own, and it is also a very substantial threat to American jobs.
I do want to spend a moment on an area where we are going to be doing
a lot more work, and I am going to have plenty to say about it before
this bill becomes law; and that is, as my friend from Idaho just talked
about, the Chinese Government's great firewall. It blocks more than
10,000 American websites and digital platforms, and others are
subjected to extreme censorship. Americans who are blocked can only
watch as Chinese homegrown competitors then rip off their very best
ideas, thrive in the absence of real competition, and then grow into
tech behemoths themselves.
The catch is, as those Chinese-grown tech giants get bigger and
bigger, using ripped-off American tech and ideas, they are also
exporting their government's intolerance of free speech.
So in the case of the great firewall, we now have trade enforcement
tools that really go back to the Dark Ages. Literally, some of them
date back to some cases in the middle of the last century, and that, in
no way, leaves us in a good position.
As Senator Crapo and I have found--and we agreed in a bipartisan
manner on this--it leaves us ill-prepared to handle the fast-moving
world of digital trade, where there are a lot of high-skill, high-wage
jobs on the line.
So, for now, I hope Members of the Senate will strongly support this
bipartisan amendment.
As Senator Crapo said, we have a lot of other things we are going to
tackle. As the Presiding Officer knows, I think what we talked about
yesterday, in terms of clean energy, can build on ideas of both
political parties. Senator Crapo has a very good idea for tech-neutral,
private sector competition for clean energy. That is his idea. I am a
Democrat, and I am acknowledging my colleague's good ideas. So we have
a lot to work with.
[[Page S3838]]
But for today, when we pass this amendment, the Crapo-Wyden
amendment, we are signaling that the entire Senate is coming together
on a straightforward proposition, that we want to tell our constituents
that we understand the urgency of outcompeting China, and that it is
going to take key tools, which is what we have developed in the Senate
Finance Committee.
I urge all Senators to vote for this bipartisan amendment.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida
Amendment No. 1802
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I want to take a moment to speak on my
amendment, and I won't take very long.
First of all, really, my comments are geared toward somebody who
might be watching or will maybe watch a video of this later because
usually there aren't a lot of mysteries here on the floor of Senate.
And when these amendments come up, everybody kind of knows the way it
is going to go. And this amendment that I am about to put forward here
is probably not going to pass. I am pretty certain it won't or we
wouldn't have gotten a vote on it. That is just the way it is.
But that is OK because--it is not OK, but it is OK in the sense that
I still want to take this opportunity to talk about this and have a
vote on it.
Let me just say this: If you go back 2, 3 years, I believe not the
first but one of the first people here who talked about the need to do
what much of this bill does was me. I have been talking now for 2 or 3
years about the need for the American Government to step forward and
partner with the private sector. I have been talking about the need for
industrial policy.
You can't compete with a nation-state if the nation-state is not
involved in the competition. And that is what we are involved in--a
nation-state competition. And it does involve a massive amount of
Chinese investment in research and development.
And we have to step up to the plate. The days of believing that on
some of these items the private market on its own will solve it, it is
not possible at this scale and scope.
I point to Operation Warp Speed. Would the private market have
eventually given us a vaccine? It would have. But we needed it now. We
stepped forward. We provided the money. The private sector responded.
And today we are standing around here with no masks on, and much of the
country is getting back to normal because we have vaccines.
You could criticize a lot of things about what America did in the
beginning of the pandemic, but we have done vaccines better than anyone
in the world, and that would not have been possible without industrial
policy, which is the partnership of government and business to solve an
urgent crisis of a national concern.
Well, when it comes to research, development, technology, that is
perhaps the single greatest requirement before us today in terms of the
future. The 21st century is going to be defined by this definition
between China--this competition between China and the United States.
And it is a competition we simply cannot win unless we step forward and
match it.
But another part of the Chinese approach to this is not simply to
invest but to steal. As many of you know, I have been on the
Intelligence Committee now for 10 years. I was acting chairman of it
for a number of months and now the vice chairman in a committee that I
think--maybe I am prejudiced in this view, but I think it is the best
functioning committee here. I am sure some would disagree. But I think
we do a lot of good work.
And it comes on topic--and I spend a lot of time reading all of the
intelligence every single day. Let me just describe my experiences over
the last few years. It is a horror show.
The Chinese are stealing our intellectual property. And it is not
just, oh, they reverse engineered someone's software; they steal the
money the taxpayers are investing in basic research and development.
We have a graph here. I have it up. The print is too small to see on
camera, but I will describe it to you. Here is how they operate, use
our universities. They prioritize--they steal priority technologies,
leverage international openness of U.S. markets, universities, and
institutes. They play scientists, researchers in universities, U.S.
National Labs, for access to emerging and foundational research and
access to dual-use export control technologies.
It goes on to say, Chinese state-owned enterprises' front and shell
companies partner with universities for access to IP, research data,
technology, penetrate U.S. company supply chains. This is their
strategy.
Now, we were about to put $200 billion of American taxpayer money in
more of that, in more of those activities. And you don't think that
they are going to do all of that against us? They are. And so it is
incumbent upon us to make sure that we have in place safeguards so they
cannot keep doing this to us.
What is the point of putting up $200 billion of American public
taxpayer money on pursuing all of this research if we are going to
allow the Chinese to steal it? Nobody here wants them to steal it.
And I know there have been improvements done in terms of upping the
security. What I want you to understand is that this is not a minor
security threat. This is the No. 1 priority of Chinese intelligence.
This is their No. 1 priority. This is what all of their agencies and
all of their government is geared toward doing. And we are going to put
all this money in there and hope that the safeguards we put in place
are going to work.
I hope they do. But what if they don't? What if a year from now we
find out, or you are going to read in an article 2 years from now,
whatever, that says: The Chinese have stolen a quarter--25, 30 percent
of the IP developed by the money that has been put forward in the bill
that was passed? Then we are all going to feel pretty stupid around
here.
That is the only thing I am aiming at. All I am asking in this
amendment is that, at least in the initial stages of this program, that
the Director of National Intelligence, the DNI, the DNI's office, and
the FBI have an opportunity to review these grants to ensure that they
do not have embedded, in the place we are giving the money to, a
scientist, a researcher at one of these National Labs or that there
isn't some shell company involved.
Now, I know the argument. I have heard the argument against it from
those who want to do the research. This is going to slow it down. It
is.
TSA slows down our ability to get on airplanes. Who wants to get rid
of TSA? Cyber security slows down our ability to access our networks.
But we need more of it, not less. Yes, security becomes burdensome. It
slows things down. But I would rather do it slow or slower and own it
than faster and have them steal it. And that is what this amendment
does.
I don't know what the opposition to it is other than I understand
that there are a lot who just want to get their hands on this money,
and they want to get going very quickly. That is what they want to do,
and that is great. That is what researchers want to do. They want to
move fast. We need them to move fast. But our job is different. Our job
is to see the problem holistically and understand, let's move as fast
as we can without allowing the Chinese to steal it
So, look, I am asking everyone to vote against this motion to table
because, frankly, I think we expose ourselves to a vulnerability. We
are placing the faith that this existing system we have, and whatever
new one we are starting up, is going to be able to withstand the force
of the intelligence agencies of an entire nation-state and their No. 1
objective, and that is how can we get our hands on whatever these $200
billion are helping to innovate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, speaking against this amendment, I
know the Senator from Florida probably, given his intelligence work,
wants to be well-meaning, but this amendment is not ready for the focus
that we need to give on issues of counterintelligence.
This amendment, as drafted, literally says that the Director of
National Intelligence should look at and certify whether any of the
entities given this money--including NASA, which would be given money
under this bill--that they would have to certify for a 10-year period
of time.
[[Page S3839]]
So, literally, every institution, every organization that gets money
under this bill would have to certify for a 10-year period of time that
they didn't have anything to do with a Chinese investment.
I am all for investigating theft and intellectual property. In fact,
the Senator from Mississippi and I added several provisions to our
legislation. Other people have added things to this legislation. But do
I want the Director of National Intelligence calling every university
in the United States that might get money from this program and asking
them to verify for the last 10 years what did they ever take as far as
Chinese investment?
I have news for you. I want the Director of National Intelligence to
be focusing on cyber security. If somebody didn't see, we have just had
a major pipeline incident. It is not the first incident; it is many
incidents in which foreign governments have threatened our Nation, our
sources of power, basically, by infiltrating our system.
I want the Director of National Intelligence to focus on Iran, to
focus on Russia, to focus on North Korea, to focus on Syria, to focus
on threats of terrorism. I want them to focus on monitoring our
organizations nationwide. I do not want them spending their time
calling university presidents and NASA officials asking them what they
have done for the last 10 years and to verify before they can get the
needed research dollars.
Now, I know the Senator is trying to be well-meaning, and I am happy
to work with him on this issue. But I know this: The race is on in
semiconductors. The race is on in quantum computing. The race is on in
AI. The race is on in other areas of manufacturing. And we cannot
afford to have our Director of National Intelligence spending his time
calling up these people when we have already implemented the securities
in this legislation.
I am happy to keep working with anybody on this issue. But, by God, I
am telling you, we are going to be committed to doing more on our
international threats on cyber security because, as you can see from
this recent pipeline incident, that is where we should be spending our
time and our focus, from a security perspective.
I ask my colleagues to table the Rubio amendment.

The 60-vote threshold having been achieved, the amendment is agreed

The amendment (No. 1562) was agreed to.
The Senator from Maryland.
Anti-Semitism
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have the opportunity to chair the U.S.
Helsinki Commission.
I am taking this time--I understand there is a break in the action in
regards to the underlying bill. If I am wrong on that, I will yield the
floor to someone in regards to moving us forward, but I understand that
we are not ready for the next issue yet.
So with that in mind, let me just take this time as the Chair of the
U.S. Helsinki Commission representing the U.S. Senate. In the Helsinki
Commission, my Republican counterpart is Senator Wicker. Senator
Wicker, by the way, is the vice president of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, and I am
the Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance.
The Helsinki Final Act speaks very clearly against all forms of
intolerance and discrimination. And we have seen in recent months
current events trigger latent bias in our community.
We go back to 9/11, where we saw the uprise of hate against the
Muslim community, which was translated into violence against Muslim
Americans.
We saw during COVID-19 latent bias against the Asian-American
community. As a result, we saw a rise of hate, of anti-Asian activity,
bias, and violence, and this body took action.
And, once again, as a result of recent violence in the Middle East,
we see a rise of anti-Semitism here in the United States and around the
world.
I mention all of that because we need to speak out whenever we see
the rise of intolerance in our community. So let me just talk about
anti-Semitism and what has happened recently.
[[Page S3840]]
A 29-year-old Jewish man was punched, kicked, and pepper-sprayed last
week in New York in broad daylight, as a group of men yelled anti-
Semitic statements. People in cars began throwing bottles and yelling
anti-Semitic slurs, including words like ``dirty Jew,'' at a dinner
party in Los Angeles. In Skokie, IL, someone shattered a window at a
synagogue. In Bal Harbour, FL, men yelled, ``Die Jew,'' at a man in a
skull cap, and then threatened to rape his wife and daughter.
These instances are compounded by an uptick in anti-Semitic speech
online, with the Anti-Defamation League finding 17,000 tweets between
May 7 and May 14--1 week--with some variation of the phrase: ``Hitler
was right.''
These attacks follow the January 6 Capitol insurrection earlier this
year, where White Supremacist and extremist groups displayed anti-
Semitic and racist symbols and recited conspiracy theories blaming Jews
for the pandemic. These conspiracy theories have proliferated alongside
anti-Semitic stereotypes and images being mainstreamed by some
political leaders and public figures.
While these events are shocking, perhaps we should not be surprised.
The ADL Global Index on Anti-Semitism, updated in 2019, found that more
than 1 billion people--nearly 1 in 8--around the world harbor anti-
Semitic attitudes.
Over 30 percent of those surveyed said it was ``probably true'' that
Jews have too much control over financial markets; that Jews think they
are better than other people; that Jews are disloyal to their country;
and that people hate Jews because of the way Jews behave. A full 41
percent think Jews are more loyal to Israel than the country they live
in.
Such sentiments too often translate into violence, leaving 40 percent
of European Jews to report in 2018 that they live in daily fear of
being physically attacked. Here at home, Jews make up fewer than 3
percent of the American population, but the majority of reported
religious-based hate crimes targeted Jewish people and institutions.
I strongly agree with ADL's CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who said last
week:
[W]e are witnessing a dangerous and drastic surge in anti-
Jewish hate. . . . To those who choose to indulge in age-old
antisemitic tropes, exaggerated claims and inflammatory
rhetoric, it has consequences: attacks in real life on real
people targeted for no other reason than they are Jewish.
This is antisemitism, plain and simple. And it's indisputably
inexcusable in any context.
In 2004, I had the opportunity to represent America at the Berlin
Conference on Anti-Semitism, where we developed an action plan to stand
up against anti-Semitism. The very first recommendation coming out of
the Berlin conference is that leaders must speak out against anti-
Semitism in any form; that leaders need to be heard. They cannot be
silent. So I was very pleased when our President, Joe Biden, stated
this past week:
The recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable,
and they must stop. I condemn this hateful behavior at home
and abroad--it's up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor.
Thank you, President Biden.
I was proud of our colleague Senator Mazie Hirono, a leader in the
Asian-American community, who posted on social media:
I've said it before and I'll say it again--an attack on one
of us is an attack on all of us. We all must condemn the
recent surge of antisemitic attacks in our country. Each of
us needs to stand up, speak out, and confront this hatred.
At my last in-person OSCE meeting before COVID-19, I hosted an event
with my European colleagues entitled ``Lessons From the Past,
Leadership for the Future,'' where we spoke about the lessons from the
Holocaust, including early warning signs from the past--some of which
have been rising to the surface again. These early warning signs
include the rise of populist leaders, demonizing of minorities,
propagandizing of hate, and the neglect of refugee protections, which
ultimately became the factors that resulted in genocide.
This month, I chaired a Helsinki Commission hearing on preventing
mass atrocities with Professor Timothy Snyder and the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum's Center for the Prevention of Genocide director, Naomi
Kikoler. This Center's Early Warning Project provides an innovative
risk assessment tool using quantitative and qualitative methods to
spotlight countries where mass atrocities have not begun, but where the
risk of such violence is high.
The warning signs are there. My colleagues, we are painfully reminded
of our past. The OSCE has repeatedly reaffirmed that hate crimes pose a
threat to the security of individuals and society, given their
potential to lead to conflict and violence on a wider scale. The spread
of hateful ideology and recent acts of hate crimes and extremism across
the OSCE region attest to this.
In response, I have called for a plan of action to address violence
and discrimination across the OSCE region, including here in the United
States, so that we may have a more strategic and cross-border approach
to addressing hate. I have also supported the OSCE initiatives that
address security concerns of Jewish communities, including by improving
relationships between law enforcement and justice institutions and
vulnerable communities, educating communities on anti-Semitism and how
to counter it, and building alliances with other communities to counter
hate.
Over the past decade, I have also worked to ensure that the State
Department's budget annually includes funding to fight anti-Semitism
globally by creating civil society partnerships between the United
States and Europe to work as allies to fight against anti-Semitism,
racism, xenophobia, anti-Muslim bigotry, hostility to the LGBTQ-plus
community, and other forms of hate. The United States should be a
global leader in fighting such intolerance.
It would be hypocritical for us as a nation to preach to the world
against hate if we let it fester and grow here at home. Like a virus,
as we all know too well, if hate exists in one country, it has the
capacity to spread around the world.
Therefore, I ask all my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting
these efforts at home and abroad to achieve safe and just societies for
all. Hate takes many forms, but none of them should be acceptable here
in the United States of America or anywhere else in the world.
With that, I yield the floor
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
S. 1260
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I am very proud of where the Senate is
headed today. It has taken well over a year-and-a-half for this bill to
finally come together, to come to fruition. There have been many
committees of jurisdiction that actively participated in this process,
Members who have accommodated other Members, and I am proud of the work
product that we have been developing here.
I especially want to thank, as we head toward what I hope is final
passage later on this evening, my legislative director, Lauren O'Brien;
my national security adviser, Brandt Anderson; Dan Cheever, who worked
on Commerce Committee, all manner of work for me. They have worked
tirelessly with Senator Schumer's staff and my colleagues on the
Republican side to ensure that this day came about, and we got a
positive outcome.
Let me say a bit about this legislation. We Americans have always
looked toward the frontier and forward to new horizons. Our ancestors
chased them across a continent and to the sea. When the wilderness was
no more, they followed them elsewhere--in workshops and laboratories
and factories and on farms, in the air and beyond.
Our spirit is restless. We prefer the difficult as Americans. We have
never accepted limits or impossibilities in life. No, instead, we
sought to cure disease to lift the human condition, to better
understand the world around us, to constantly go faster and further in
these and other endeavors. And we do these things always aware that the
new knowledge that they bring will benefit mankind and make our Union
stronger.
But this spirit is not entirely ours alone. You see, there are others
out there who also harbor bold ambitions, but they don't share our
democratic
[[Page S3841]]
values. Just days ago, Communist China orbited, landed, and deployed a
rover on the surface of Mars. No other nation has done this. No other
nation has done this. It was their first voyage to the red planet. It
is only part of the Chinese Communist Party's ambitious space program.
And it is another direct challenge to the United States of America.
Now, this momentous event happens at a time when so many of our
citizens feel overlooked, when the communities they call home are
hollowing out, when trust in our civic institutions is eroding, and
when our allegiance seems increasingly to our political tribes and not
to one another as citizens for the common good.
Let's not kid ourselves. The Chinese Communist Party plans to exploit
our difficulties and divisions. Their power and their capabilities are
growing. They are, indeed, locked in a global competition with this
great Nation, and they intend to win it. They intend to win it.
They think of those of us in this Chamber as powerless to stop them
and unable to prioritize our Nation's long-term goals over our party's
short-term gains.
So I ask you this: When future generations of Americans cast their
gaze toward new frontiers, will they see a red flag planted on those
new frontiers that is not our own?
Today, we answer, unequivocally, no. Today, we declare our intention
to win this century and those that follow it as well. Today, we
demonstrate our faith in the American people to lead the way and vote
to give them the tools to do so.
This bill, this moment, is really not about beating China. It is
really not about beating China. You see, the Endless Frontier Act is
about using their challenge to become a better version of ourselves. It
is about helping more Americans get more skin in the game, deploying
their talents and untapped potential. It is about supercharging our
economy as we emerge from this global pandemic which descended upon us
from Communist China. It is about spreading the benefits of this
economy far and wide and preparing and allowing more people, regardless
of their circumstances or their place of birth, to meaningfully
participate in the 21st century.
It is about unleashing what Emma Lazarus called the imprisoned
lightning across this land and aiding so many Americans in their
pursuit of our common happiness.
You see this is how we unite our Nation and tilt the balance of a
great power struggle westward. This is how we become the first to reach
the next great horizon.
Let history record that at this moment we stood united. We declared
with solemn purpose and single voice that this is our destination; that
by confronting the challenges of today, we built a brighter tomorrow;
and that a new generation of doers and dreamers pressed America on,
once again, toward the endless frontier.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.
Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I was tremendously proud and grateful to be at the
bill signing last week in the East Room of the White House with the
President of the United States, at his side when he put his approval on
a measure that took years to pass, the NO HATE Act--known as the
Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, named after Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer,
who perished as a result of the most vicious and vile hate crimes in
this Nation's history. The occasion was centered on legislation
addressing protection for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. It was
a tremendously moving and powerful event when the President spoke
passionately and unequivocally that hate has no safe harbor in the
United States.
I was reminded of those moments with the President of the United
States as I witnessed just very recently this surge in anti-Semitic
hate crimes across this country. We have seen them again and again and
again. The Anti-Defamation League has been tracking anti-Semitic
incidents in the country since 1979, and the past three annual reports
have included two of its highest tallies. Last year's report recorded
more than 1,200 incidents--a 10-percent increase from the previous
year.
These assaults and insults, brawls, and vicious desecrations have
occurred across the country to individuals in synagogues and places of
worship, and we should be rising to condemn them now unequivocally and
clearly, condemn all of these acts of hate, because we are all in this
perilous time together.
We know from the acts of hatred directed against Asian Americans that
they follow similar kinds of assaults and incidents involving Muslim
Americans, Black Americans, and Jewish Americans. An assault on one is
an assault on all of us. But the assaults and the acts of hatred
against Jewish Americans have been particularly vile and venomous over
these last 2, 4 weeks and months. We have seen not only the physical
attacks but also Holocaust denial and distortion, including intentional
efforts to excuse or minimize the impact of the Holocaust.
These kinds of vicious and intolerable statements have grown. That is
one reason why I continue to support the Never Again Education Act,
which was signed into law almost 1 year ago, to expand the United
States Holocaust Museum education programming and the development and
dissemination of accurate, relevant, and accessible resources to
improve awareness and understanding of the Holocaust. But prevention
through education is not enough. We must do more. We must act.
What is most important to remember about every one of these incidents
is that they involve real people, real communities, and real victims
whose lives are torn apart in the most heartbreaking cases. They
involve real lives that are lost forever and real families who will
never see their loved ones again.
That is what happened to the families of Khalid Jabara and Heather
Heyer. They were in the East Room of the White House with us,
graciously and generously lending their presence, their faces, and
their voices to this effort against hate crime. They expressed
gratitude for the actions we are taking.
Now we must move forward to provide the funding for the NO HATE Act
so we have greater reporting of these vicious acts and so that we have
better training and more prevention and action--not just condemnation
but action against anti-Semitism in this country.
I read recently that a 5-year-old was constructing a Lego of a
synagogue and, using those Legos, added a security force around the
synagogue. What kind of America is it that requires a 5-year-old
building a place of worship out of Legos to include a police security
guard? And what kind of America is it that has double the number of
reported anti-Semitic harassment, vandalism, and violence just over a
2-week period most recently when there were clashes in Israel and Gaza?
It is not the America we know and love, and it is not the America we
deserve.
We must do better, and I know my colleagues share this view. I heard
and saw my friend and colleague Senator Cardin speak powerfully on this
issue just moments ago. We know that we as a body can take action
because hate is contagious, but so is courage. We must provide all of
the people who have courage and good will in this country with the kind
of support that we can, that we must, and that we will to fight anti-
Semitism and to make sure that this America is the one that we know and
love and that my father came to believe in as an immigrant at the age
of 17 when he escaped persecution in Germany, coming here at 17 years
old in 1935 with not much more than the shirt on his back, knowing no
one, speaking virtually no English, but believing in that America that
would provide him freedom and opportunity and, yes, protection against
exactly the kind of anti-Semitism whose beginnings are in those kinds
of vile and vicious assaults and words we see around the world today.
Let us all come together and fight anti-Semitism just as we have done
with the hate crimes against our brother and sister Asian Americans and
make sure that our country is the one that we know and love.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York
Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1520
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today to once again ask that
every Senator have a chance to consider and cast their vote on the
Military Justice
[[Page S3842]]
Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act.
This bill would ensure that when crimes are committed in our
military, justice is delivered. This commonsense reform, which has
bipartisan, filibuster-proof support, moves the decision on whether to
prosecute serious crimes to independent, trained, and professional
military prosecutors, while leaving misdemeanors and uniquely military
crimes within the chain of command. In other words, it takes the same
approach to criminal justice that the military takes in most other
areas of operation. It puts highly technical work in the hands of
trained specialists.
This is not a new concept. I first introduced a similar form of this
legislation in 2013.
This is not a new idea that requires hypothetical thinking. This
system or a version of it is already being used by our allies around
the world to positive effect. Australia has moved charging decisions
for serious crimes from the chain of command to the director of
military prosecutions, as has Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland. In
France, charging decisions are made by lawyers, not by commanders.
Germany tries military cases in civilian courts with civilian
authorities. In Italy, charging decisions are made by judge advocates,
who are fully independent of the chain of command. The Netherlands
assigns charging decisions to public prosecutors with broad experience
in military cases. Norway uses military prosecuting authority for
criminal offenses by military personnel. The UK moved serious crimes
out of the chain of command in 2009 as part of an effort to provide an
independent and impartial tribunal to the accused. In Israel, charging
decisions are made by judge advocates whose sole commander is the
military advocate general, a general officer.
I will note that the Israeli system is almost identical to the
procedures set forth in our bill. Israel has not seen a decrease in
good order and discipline and, in fact, has seen increased reporting
and faith in their military justice system.
These countries took serious crimes out of the chain of command
because they believed that defendants have a right to civil liberties.
They recognized that servicemembers deserve a trial not led by a
commander, who often has no legal experience or education, but by
trained criminal lawyers.
When they made these changes, they did not see a diminution in
command control or the ability to maintain good order and discipline
within their ranks. In fact, when we stop asking commanders to act as
judge and jury in complex cases, they will have more time to focus on
rebuilding the trust and cohesion among their ranks that we know is
critical to military readiness.
We pride ourselves on having the best military in the world. To
maintain it, we need to do more to make it safe for everyone to serve.
Our allies have already done this. Every day we don't act is a day we
fall further behind on this front.
This is a tried and tested system. It has delivered change for our
allies that the incremental reforms put in place by the Armed Services
Committee have not delivered to our servicemembers. This reform has
been tested; requested by survivors, veterans, and commanders; backed
by experts in military justice; and supported by 65 Senators. There is
no reason to delay a vote on the floor any further.
I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be determined by the
majority leader in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate
Armed Services Committee be discharged from further consideration of S.
1520 and the Senate proceed to its consideration; that there be 2 hours
for debate equally divided in the usual form; and that upon the use or
yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the bill with no
intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. For the
reasons I articulated on Monday and remain, I think, accurate, I would
object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I would like to actually give some
information to the chairman about what these other nations' leaders
have actually said about this issue.
Major General Blaise Cathcart, advocate general of the Canadian Armed
Forces, wrote:
The 1999 changes to the military justice system were battle
tested in the theater of active operations and, in my view,
were a key contributor to combat effectiveness of the
Canadian armed forces. The current military justice system
contributed substantially to the fielding and sustainment of
a disciplined and efficient force with high morale.
Air Commander Paul Cronan, director general of the Australian Defense
Force Legal Service:
At this point, it's appropriate to reflect on the effect of
the reforms made to the Australian military justice system in
2003 and 2006. These reforms have undoubtedly had a
significant and positive impact on the efficacy,
impartiality, and perceived fairness of Australia's military
justice system. This is a fact confirmed by a number of
subsequent independent reviews of the effectiveness of the
2003 and 2006 reforms. As a result of their independent
review, they concluded that the reforms had been effective,
and that as a result of these reforms, ``The military justice
system is delivering and should continue to deliver
impartial, rigorous, and fair outcomes. Enhanced transparency
and enhanced oversight is substantially more independent from
the chain of command, and is effective in maintaining a high
standard of discipline both domestically and in the
operational theater.''
In the UK, Commander Andrei Spence, Commodore Naval Legal Service,
Royal Navy, UK:
Probably the most pressing question that you need answering
from me, and if I may preempt it slightly at the risk of
being too forthcoming, is what's the effect on command of our
changes? How do they view it? Do they feel disempowered,
disenfranchised? I have to say that the simple answer to that
is no.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter this testimony into
the Record
There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in
the Record, as follows:
MJIIPA: Allies Testimony
Maj. Gen. Blaise Cathcart, Advocate General of the Canadian Armed
Forces
``The Canadian armed forces require a robust and fair
military justice system to investigate, prosecute, and
adjudicate allegations of sexual assault. As the
superintendent of the administration of the Canadian military
justice system, I am confident our system meets the
disciplinary needs of the chain of command while addressing
the interests of victims and reflecting the constitutionality
protected Canadian values of fairness, transparency, and the
rule of law . . . The 1999 changes to the military justice
system were battle tested in the theater of active operations
and, in my view were a key contributor to the combat
effectiveness of the Canadian armed forces. The current
military justice system contributed substantially to the
fielding and sustainment of a disciplined and efficient force
with high morale.''
Maj. Gen. Steve Noonan, Deputy Commander, Canadian Joint Operations
Command
``My intent is simply to inform the Panel that as an
operational commander, I'm very comfortable with where we
have evolved to, recognizing the continued key role of the
commanding officer in the system, and the latitude that the
system still provides for us to maintain good order and
discipline, two key elements of operational effectiveness . .
. In terms of the role of the commanding officer in the court
martial process, in sensitive matters, like an alleged sexual
assault, we believe it is in the best interest of the chain
of command, the accused, and the complainant to have an
independent investigator assess the evidence and lay charges,
an independent prosecutor determine whether or not to
proceed, and an independent court martial administrator
convene a court martial. All of these actors, in my view,
strengthen my role in the chain of command as those under my
command can be confident in the real and perceived
independence of the military justice system.''

Service

Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Amendment No. 2103
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to support amendment No. 2103,
which addresses a very important issue in the world, which is the issue
of governments that undertake to destroy populations, either in other
countries or within their own country; that is, to commit genocide.
Now, this topic comes up because China is committing genocide against
its own Uighur population--a million Uighurs who are enslaved, who are
trapped, who are assaulted in every possible way by the official
authorities operating out of Beijing.
The finding of genocide is one that the State Department takes very
seriously. It involves long investigations, collection of evidence,
analysis. It is not something to say lightly. But we now have two
Secretaries of State who have led our State Department through this
process and reached the same conclusion--Secretary Pompeo, under
President Trump, and Secretary Blinken, under President Biden. And both
find that this is, in fact, genocide.
Now, at this very moment, athletes are preparing to compete in the
Olympic Games in China, and I find it horrific that the prestige of the
Games is going to be carried on for a country that is committing
genocide.
Now, we have a Commission that works on human rights issues, known as
the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, and it hauls a whole
team of experts who work to analyze human rights issues. This
commission, which is bipartisan and bicameral and includes executive
branch appointees, when they are actually appointed, has held a
hearing.
At that hearing, various experts came and testified on what China is
doing. It reinforced what the Secretary of State under our former
President and the Secretary of State under our current President found:
Genocide is being conducted by the government in China against the
Uighur population
And that is not all China is doing. There are other afflicted groups
that it is assaulting. In addition, it has proceeded to start stripping
the political rights of the people of Hong Kong.
It is very much in the news. We have seen the citizens protesting in
the streets, hundreds of thousands, saying: China, honor the commitment
you made when Britain transferred Hong Kong back under a 50-year
agreement to China.
And China has not honored that agreement.
Now, China, when it was awarded the Games back in 2015 to be held in
2022--7 years in advance--made human rights promises to the
International Olympic Committee--promises that have not been upheld. In
fact, during those years, China has become an even worse violator of
human rights in Hong Kong, in Xinjiang, and in other ethnic areas,
including Tibet.
So we have echoes of 1936--the year the summer Olympics were held in
Germany and Hitler was in charge. He used those Olympic Games to shine
prestige on his country and to essentially help distract enormously
from his already horrific actions against Jewish Germans and other
groups within Germany.
So how is it here, nearly a century later, that, again, the Olympics
are going to be used to shine a little bit of light and a lot of
prestige on a country engaged in genocide?
I want to compliment my colleague Senator Romney of Utah. He has
placed in the underlying bill, as it came out of the Foreign Relations
Committee, a provision that says: When the Olympics are held, there
should be a diplomatic boycott to protest and draw attention to this
egregious situation. I hope, also, that the sponsors of those games
will start to withdraw their sponsorships.
Now, my friend and colleague Senator Romney is an expert on the
Olympic Games because he organized the Olympic Games in Utah. Nobody in
America probably knows more about what it takes to prepare for them.
And it is not, at this moment, possible for the structure that has been
established to host the athletes to be redone and to pivot for just
next year, which I find unfortunate, but I understand the point.
So let's do this together. Let's send a strong message to the Olympic
Committee, the IOC, that never again should they allow a country to
host the Olympic Games that is engaged in genocide. This should be a
message that every American can say together--that never should a
country be given the prestige of hosting the games when they are
committing genocide. Never should a country be able to host the games
when it is something like what China is doing to the Uighur
population--enslaving them, stripping them of their dignity, their
autonomy, their culture, controlling them in every way, enslaving them.
Never again should the Games be able to be hosted by a country like
China that is restricting the political rights of Hong Kong--what China
is doing, stripping the freedom of speech, stripping the freedom of
assembly, and breaking the deal that it signed when the deal was struck
with Britain for the return of Hong Kong.
So this amendment, cosponsored by Senator Rubio, who is the cochair
in the Senate of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China;
cosponsored by Senator Romney, who knows more about the Olympic Games
than anybody else in this country; cosponsored by Senator Young, who
has been a terrific champion against the abuse of citizens in Yemen and
the abuse of citizens in Burma--let's adopt this amendment as part of
this package while we are on the topic of China, while we are on the
topic of trade.
Let's not let this moment bypass us without saying with a unified
voice that this is wrong, and that the Olympics, which were designed to
lift up the human spirit, to celebrate the best of competition, to have
kind of the thrills and the agonies of victory and defeat--that never
should the Games, the focal point of world attention, be hosted by a
country that is committing genocide.
Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.
January 6 Commission
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, colleagues, this coming Monday is
Memorial Day. Many of us are making our plans to commemorate the
holiday, the weekend, where we honor those who made the ultimate
sacrifice in defense of our Nation and in defense of our democracy--
those brave Americans and so many others who have worked, fought, and
died for more than 200 years to protect our system of government--of
the people, by the people, for the people. Upholding that legacy is our
highest duty, and it is in that spirit that I rise today.
On November 3, 2020, I was serving as California's secretary of
state. It was my privilege for 6 years to serve as the chief elections
officer in our Nation's most populous and most diverse State, and I can
tell you that even in the best of times, election administration is
complex. Elections are consequential operations.
Last year, our elections workers at all levels of government faced
the additional, unprecedented challenge of administering an election
during a global health pandemic. And I am proud to say that they rose
to the occasion to protect the democratic legacy that we hold and
trust. And, as a result, California's election officials administered
an accessible, secure, and safe election, which drew historic voter
turnout. Indeed, by every objective measure, the 2020 elections were a
national success.
But none of this mattered to President Trump, who had spent years
attacking the integrity of our elections by repeatedly lying about
voter fraud and ``rigged elections,'' even the election that he won in
2016.
President Trump was furious at his 2020 loss, and he chose to take a
sledgehammer to the core of our democratic system. He didn't just
refuse to concede the election--breaking a tradition that dates back to
Thomas Jefferson--President Trump attacked the very notion of a
peaceful transition of power.
[[Page S3844]]
Along the way, he filed and lost more than 60 cynical lawsuits
challenging the election. He personally called State elections
officials and pressured them to alter vote tallies--tallies that had
been counted, recounted, and audited.
And he lied to the American people, tweeting out a steady stream of
conspiracy theories and disinformation denying his electoral loss.
Online and around the country, President Trump's Big Lie caught fire.
Sadly, many Republican officials participated in fanning the flames,
spreading fears of voter fraud for political gain. Others stood by
silently as President Trump radicalized his supporters with falsehoods.
They chose loyalty to Trump over the truth, delusion over democracy.
Let me be clear. These allegations of fraud had no basis in fact.
They were rooted in Trump's ego and cemented in White supremacy. And
they led directly to the deadly insurrection of January 6, an
unprecedented attack on our Nation's Capitol by violent extremists
against the U.S. House of Representatives and this Senate, invited and
incited by the President of the United States.
Armed rioters brutally beat Capitol Police officers and stormed this
building. The Confederate flag, the symbol of violent White supremacy,
flew inside this Capitol for the first time in our Nation's history.
Members of militarized hate groups searched these hallways with the
intent to kill elected leaders of both parties. They made their way to
this very floor to try to stop the certification of the Presidential
election, and in so doing, they terrorized our staff, Capitol Police,
the free press, our citizens across the country, and our democracy
itself.
Through their violence, the January 6 rioters disrupted our democracy
at the behest of President Trump, and our Nation lost the right to call
the transition of power peaceful.
Now we gather in the wake of this armed insurrection, the deadly
insurrection. The scars of January 6 can still be seen throughout the
building. Yet many of my Republican colleagues say: We just need to
move on. Let's just move forward.
They say that this deadly attack was simply a group of ``peaceful
protesters'' on a ``normal tourist visit''? They claim that the
proposed Commission to investigate the January 6 insurrection is
unnecessary because we have already increased Capitol security and our
congressional committees are already investigating this attack.
These arguments are outrageous. Of course we need an independent
Commission to fully investigate the causes of the attack. We need to
know the whole truth about January 6. We need and the American people
deserve an independent, bipartisan investigation that will give us the
facts and allow us to begin the hard work of restoring public trust in
our democracy. It is the only way to ensure that an attack like this
does not happen again.
The bipartisan bill we are considering is modeled after the
bipartisan 9/11 Commission. Imagine arguing in the wake of 9/11 that
the only problem that we needed to address was airport security. That
is how ridiculous this counterargument is. To brush aside the January 6
attack on the American people would be the ultimate dereliction of our
duty.
Colleagues, we swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution
of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. So I
call on my Republican colleagues to live up to that oath, live up to
that sacred duty. And if you cannot, if your hand is frozen by fear of
those who were misled to believe that the election was stolen, if your
hand is frozen out of fear of the President who sold that lie, then the
insurrectionists have succeeded.
I urge the Senate to authorize the January 6 Commission on a
bipartisan vote, but if our Republican colleagues refuse to join us,
then we will face another choice: Do we continue to defend our system
of self-government or defend the filibuster? The stakes could not be
higher. The choice could not be clearer. The peaceful transition of
power must be defended.
Colleagues, this is a moment where we must put country over politics,
put the institutions of our democracy over the abuse of the filibuster.
On January 6, our government was attacked, and now the future of our
democracy is on the line. Let's act like it.
I yield the floor
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
S. 1260
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor very briefly
today to thank Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch for the great
work they did on the Foreign Relations Committee to add to the pending
legislation a title developed in the Foreign Relations Committee that
makes sure that we are building the kinds of capacities inside the
State Department and USAID that are able to make sure America can
compete with China and a host of other developing, advancing nations
all around the world.
The fact is, we are often fighting our competitors with one hand tied
behind our back. For instance, the size of the Chinese international
development bank dwarfs the capacities of the similar institution that
is used by the United States of America, the DFC.
We have added new capacities to the DFC in this legislation that will
allow the United States of America to be able to make sure that we can
do development deals around the world and compete with other nations
that are fast investing significant amounts of money and trying to use
that money as leverage to gain political interest and political
influence.
Included in that title, midwifed through the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, is a provision that builds upon the expectation that
Congress should have that the administration share with us agreements
that they have entered into on behalf of the United States. If we want
to play our constitutional role to be a coequal branch with the
executive on the setting of American foreign policy, then, of course,
this body needs to have access--immediate access--to any agreements,
whether they be binding or nonbinding, that the Federal Government,
through the executive branch, has entered into on behalf of the
American people.
I am very pleased that the legislation includes a requirement that,
in an expeditious manner, the executive branch, whether there is a
Republican President or a Democratic President, share with Congress any
agreements that they have entered into on behalf of our constituents.
That section of the bill goes a little bit further than that, though.
It also says that the administration shall notify Congress anytime that
the administration is beginning a negotiation over a prospective
agreement with a foreign nation. Again, that, on its face, makes a lot
of sense, the idea that the administration should be communicating with
Congress when they have begun a significant negotiation with a foreign
country that may ultimately obligate the United States or this Congress
with respect to an international agreement.
I raised, during the consideration of this bill in the Foreign
Relations Committee and I have continued to raise both publicly and
privately, concerns I have that I think are shared by current and
former diplomats that there is a potential that by going too far in our
request that the administration inform us of negotiations, we could
provide a chill on both our government's willingness to enter into what
are sometimes very sensitive, early negotiations with foreign
governments but also a chill on foreign nations' interest in entering
into negotiations with the United States of America if they were to
understand that anytime they began a conversation with the United
States about a very sensitive matter, there would be a notification to
Congress that could easily become public.
In fact, there are good reasons sometimes where the executive branch,
early on in a negotiation, before they know whether it is even going to
become an agreement a year, 2 years down the line, would want the space
to conduct that negotiation without the public eye coming down on those
proceedings.
So I think there is a way to get this right. I think that we want to
make
[[Page S3845]]
sure that any agreements are sent to Congress. I can even understand
how, in some circumstances, when you are talking about big negotiations
of national significance, we would want to know at some point when
those negotiations have begun. But I think you have to understand that
there are two equities at play here. One is transparency, the right of
Congress to get information from the executive branch, but the other
equity is that we don't want to do anything here that would
disincentivize diplomacy, that would create a massive bureaucracy
inside the State Department that would serve as a barrier to
negotiations with countries that may avoid a war or may end up in a
more efficient expenditure of U.S. taxpayer dollars.
So I want to raise this concern about this language that is included
in the substitute amendment. I know that there is a long way before
this bill is law. Obviously, the House will take up their own version,
and there will be some reconciliation between the House and the Senate.
And I am glad to have Senator Menendez's commitment to continue to have
this discussion to make sure that we balance these equities--the equity
of Congress's right to know with the equity to invest and incentivize
in American diplomacy.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.
Tribute to Lynn Aas
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, it is a great honor for me today to
recognize a North Dakota legend who is celebrating his 100th birthday
on June 4. Lynn Aas, of Minot, is one of our State's most treasured
residents. With his engaging personality and deep commitment to public
service, Lynn has experienced many great moments in our State's and in
our Nation's history.
Lynn was raised during the Great Depression on a farm near the town
of Benedict, 40 miles south of Minot. He earned law and business
degrees from the University of North Dakota, managed a medical clinic,
served in the North Dakota Legislature for 8 years, and was a delegate
to the State's 1972 Constitutional Convention. He and his late wife
Beverly raised four sons. To this day, Lynn remains active in his
community.
With all that has been so remarkable about Lynn's life, it is his
service during World War II that resonates the most with those who know
him. Like with so many other young North Dakotans, the Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941 changed the course of Lynn's life.
In August 1942, Lynn had just finished his first year of college when
he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He began basic training in March 1943 and
became part of the 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment of the 17th Airborne
Division. Following intensive training stateside, he boarded a ship in
Boston in August 1944 heading to Liverpool, England.
Lynn's first combat experience was the Battle of the Bulge, one of
the costliest battles in American history, with more than 80,000 U.S.
casualties, including 19,000 American soldiers killed. His division and
unit were flown to France and transported by trucks to Bastogne on
December 24, 1944. His platoon entered combat on January 7, fighting in
deep snow, frigid cold, and heavy fog. Beginning with 55 troopers, Lynn
was one of only 5 survivors to leave the frontlines 3 weeks later.
The end of January brought his first 2 nights of sleep under a roof
in 5 weeks.
In February, his platoon fought along the Siegfried Line on Nazi
Germany's border.
Later in March, he participated in Operation Varsity, the last large-
scale Allied airborne operation of the war. There, he was towed in a
glider and landed behind enemy lines near Wesel, Germany.
Lynn's combat days ended on March 25 when he was wounded in his left
arm by shrapnel. Following extensive recuperation back in America, Lynn
remained in the Army another 5 months until he was honorably discharged
on November 1, 1945.
For his valor and commendable 18 months of service during World War
II, he was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star medals, in addition
to the Glider Badge, Combat Infantryman's Badge, Good Conduct Medal,
American Campaign Medal, European Campaign Medal with one Bronze
Arrowhead and three Bronze Campaign Stars, and the World War II Victory
Medal.
Later in his life, Lynn attend reunions of the 17th Airborne
Division. In 1999, he visited Europe with other 17th Airborne Division
veterans, visiting the locations where they had fought more than 55
years earlier.
In 2015, he visited Belgium again to commemorate the 70th anniversary
of the Battle of the Bulge. As one of the official representatives from
the United States to this observance, Lynn was greeted by many grateful
Belgians who had not forgotten what American soldiers did to liberate
them from Hitler's tyranny.
In 2017, the French Government awarded Lynn its highest honor, the
Knight of the Legion of Honor medal--an award created by Napoleon in
1802. It was my great honor to be at that commemoration. The letter
from the French Government notifying Lynn of this award carried these
poignant words:
73 years ago, you gave your youth to France and the French
people. Many of your fellow soldiers did not return but they
remain in our hearts. . . . You saved us. We will never
forget. For us, the French people, you are a hero. Gratitude
and remembrance are forever in our souls.
Mr. President, Lynn Aas was one of 60,000 North Dakotans to serve in
the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II. Of those, nearly 2,000 gave
their lives for our freedom in this largest and deadliest conflict in
world history. With only some 500 World War II veterans still alive in
North Dakota, the heroism of every single one of them is appreciated
more than ever.
Throughout his life, Lynn Aas has embodied the best of the ``greatest
generation.'' He has lived a meaningful life, sharing his history as a
World War II soldier throughout so the rest of us can better understand
and appreciate the selfless service and sacrifice of every veteran.
On behalf of all North Dakotans, I wish Lynn Aas a very happy 100th
birthday on June 4 and many more years of health and vitality. As he
celebrates with his large family and many friends in Minot, I honor him
as one of North Dakota's most exemplary citizens.
I yield back.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to thank our friend Senator
Cramer for telling us this story about this great American patriot.
Many of us are of that age where we are the children of members of the
``greatest generation'' who have their own stories to tell. Just
listening to Senator Cramer talk about this great patriot who fought at
the Battle of the Bulge, one of the most horrific battles in World War
II and most consequential battles--that is really where they really
stopped Hitler, finally, toward the end of the war--it reminds me of
people like my dad who flew B-17s out of England during the last part
of the war. Their job was to knock out the Hitler war machine. But
there are so many great stories from that generation. These great World
War II patriots are getting older, and they are leaving us, but
certainly we will always remember them and their contributions. So I
appreciate the Senator from North Dakota sharing that with us.
S. 1260
Mr. President, the Senate is moving quickly, I hope, toward a vote on
a far-reaching proposal to confront threats from China. Based on
everything we know about the might and the ambitions of the Chinese
Communist Party, there is a clear and urgent need for us to take
action.
Every year, the U.S. intelligence community issues a threat
assessment report outlining the greatest challenges confronting our
country on the horizon. Topping the latest report, which was released
last month, is China's push for global power. The report outlines
China's efforts to strengthen its military power, diversify its nuclear
arsenal, and fine-tune its cyber espionage skills, which are already
quite considerable.
One major area that cannot be overlooked is China's industrial
policy. Through the CCP's Made in China 2025 initiative, it seeks to
achieve China's dominance in high-tech manufacturing. For everything
from electric cars to advanced robotics, to artificial
[[Page S3846]]
intelligence, to quantum computing, China wants to lead global
production, and they are throwing serious money into the effort to get
there. China is expected to spend $1.4 trillion by 2025, covering
investments in everything from 5G to artificial intelligence.
The 2021 threat assessment report raises alarm bells here too. It
says China will maintain these efforts because ``Chinese leaders see
this strategy as necessary to reduce dependence on foreign
technologies, enable military advances, and sustain economic growth and
thus ensure the CCP's survival.'' I view this as both an alarming
statement but really more as a call to action. If China is making these
kinds of investments to increase its independence and global presence,
we should be investing in our industrial base and our national security
here at home. The most important place to start, I believe, is with
semiconductor manufacturing.
The pandemic is hopefully soon to be in our rearview mirror as more
and more Americans, more and more people get vaccinated. One of the
most important lessons I believe we should have learned is the
vulnerability of our supply chains, everything from personal protective
equipment, most of which is made in China--and in the global race to
get the PPE we needed during the pandemic, China got a head start
because China manufactured it and we did not here at home.
So that opened up my eyes to the vulnerability of that supply chain,
but we can't stop there. We need to look at how heavily we rely on
other countries for semiconductors because nearly 90 percent of the
semiconductors in the world are made in Southeast Asia, with Taiwan
dominating the market. In fact, one company, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company, accounted for more than one-half of total
foundry revenues last year. Companies in Taiwan control 63 percent of
the advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the world.
Now, if you are like me, before I got involved in this issue, I
didn't really know very much about semiconductors, so I asked my staff
to explain to me the significance of this vulnerability. They said:
Well, Senator, think of it this way: Everything with an off and on
switch involves semiconductors.
Well, that helped me quite a bit. Then I asked them to research
something for me. I said: You see those rockets that are raining down
on Israel from Hamas? Some of those interceptors are made by Raytheon,
an American-based defense contractor. Ask them how many semiconductors
are in a single interceptor.
They did the research, and they reported back--750 semiconductors in
a single interceptor.
So these semiconductors or microelectronics are everywhere,
everywhere--in the phones we carry, in the planes that our Air Force,
Navy, and Marines are flying, the fifth-generation stealth fighter, the
F-35. Semiconductors are everywhere. Given China's ambitions, it is
easy to imagine how they might be tempted to interfere with the supply
chain and our dependence on Asian-produced semiconductors. If China
were to block or even invade Taiwan, we would be literally helpless.
Back in 1980, Jimmy Carter gave a speech in which he laid down what
came to be known as the Carter Doctrine. This was 2 years after the
Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. He wanted to send a message to the
world that they should not mess with U.S. access to the oil that came
through the Strait of Hormuz in the Middle East.
So he laid down the Carter doctrine. He said: Anybody who interferes
with our access to the oil that we need to power our armed services and
our economy, that would be an act of war. Well, I don't think it is an
exaggeration to say if another country were to block our access to
semiconductors, it could well rise to the same sort of act of war that
Jimmy Carter warned about in 1980. In other words, semiconductors have
become the new oil in terms of our dependency, and it is a dangerous
dependency we must correct.
This is precisely why the senior Senator from Virginia and I, Senator
Warner, introduced the CHIPS for America Act. It is crucial that we
shore up our dependence on chips manufactured overseas and we shore up
our domestic production.
The vast majority of our colleagues have agreed that this is a
critical task. It was carefully crafted after monthslong bipartisan,
bicameral negotiations. Recently, we had a meeting at the White House,
and President Biden agreed with us that this was a critical imperative.
This is literally a bipartisan, bicameral agreement with the executive
branch and legislative branch that this is something we need to fix.
Last fall, when we took up the National Defense Authorization Act, we
introduced an amendment that authorized what we now hope to be able to
pay for, which is an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act, which
passed 96 to 4. Now we need to fund the program, and there is just one
issue standing in the way.
During committee consideration of the Endless Frontier Act, an
amendment was adopted that would apply controversial Davis-Bacon
language to the underlying CHIPS for America provision signed into law
last year. This provision creates, I believe, an unnecessary
distraction from our focus, which should be on defeating this
vulnerability in the supply chain.
The fact is, current wages of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing
companies don't need Davis-Bacon. They pay much better than the
prevailing wage Davis-Bacon would require. So it is really a nonissue
when it comes to semiconductor manufacturing.
But what is more significant--and I think the reason why some of our
Democratic friends are insisting on this inclusion--is it represents an
expansion over labor policies by applying it to private construction as
opposed to public works. Obviously, this would set a troublesome
precedent.
Leaving this language in the bill, I do believe, has the potential to
weaken the support for the broader legislation. And I hope we can all
agree that the stakes are too high to risk letting that happen.
Last week, I introduced an amendment to strike this unnecessary and
divisive provision and maintain strong bipartisan support for the
underlying CHIPS for America legislation. A partisan provision with
zero impact is hardly a reason to sacrifice the strong bipartisan
support we have seen for the CHIPS Act.
Republicans and Democrats have worked very closely together and, I
think, really in an encouraging and responsible way to bolster domestic
manufacturing of semiconductors and confront one of the biggest looming
threats to our national security and our economic security. Now is not
the time to backpedal on the progress we have made.
I expect the Senate will vote on my amendment later this evening. I
encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this
amendment so we can maintain the strong bipartisan support we have
demonstrated so far for this critical, critical legislation.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to follow my colleague from Texas
to talk about the very issue that he brought up, which is where is
America going with semiconductor manufacturing, design, and
development.
On this last point, I am pretty sure we see things differently. I am
pretty sure that the majority--probably all of the Democrats would be
enthusiastic about supporting both manufacturing in the United States
as well as making sure that if Federal dollars are used, prevailing
wage should be applied. I am sure we will differ on that point.
But I think that we are, at least on our side of the aisle,
supportive of this concept that chip fabrication, chip manufacturing in
the United States of America is an important sector and that we are
facing a chip shortage and that we should do something about it.
If you think about it, semiconductors are like the oil of the 21st
century. They have become an essential aspect. They can be found in
children's toys, in appliances, computers, cell phones, our
telecommunications networks, and advanced national security technology,
as my colleague was mentioning. They enable healthcare, artificial
intelligence applications, financial services, and certainly in the
area of defense.
They have transformed how we communicate, how we learn, how we
socialize. Yet they are so complex and manufacturing so expensive, it
can cost anywhere from $5 to almost $20 billion--$20
[[Page S3847]]
billion is one number I have heard--just to build these facilities.
This is why this issue has become so important.
The United States has had strong leadership in the semiconductor
area, but massive investments from other nations put us at a
disadvantage when it comes to manufacturing. They are subsidizing and
getting tax benefits up to 40 percent to build in Korea than in the
United States of America. The Endless Frontier Act tries to address
that because it really is a national security and telecommunications
policy
In the 1990s, the United States produced over 37 percent of the
global chips supply. As you know, here in the United States, we have 48
percent of the world's aircraft production, but now with these
challenges, as we look at the chip supply, they are down to 12 percent.
I noticed in the Wall Street Journal they said: Why do we care? Why
do we care? They basically are saying that chips in fabrication have
become a commodity and that we don't have to worry about it anymore. As
long as we are winning on the design side, we don't care where it is
manufactured.
Well, if you ask me, that is so 1980s--I mean, the idea that you
could design a product here and then have it manufactured somewhere
else. Maybe that works with shoes or outdoor clothing, but it doesn't
work with something as sophisticated and changing as a high-tech
innovation product like semiconductors. In fact, I would say, if you
really think that type of thinking works, just look at what happened.
It is really pro-COVID thinking. We thought we could have the design
done here and, basically, some of these devices that we use here, like
ventilators, we will just produce them overseas. What could possibly go
wrong? Well, we figured out what could go wrong. If we are not
manufacturing ventilators here in the United States, something could go
wrong, and it did.
The question is, What is going to go wrong if we don't manufacture
chips in the United States of America? The thing I don't think that the
Wall Street Journal quite got right is that they don't understand that
in today's innovation cycle, having a cluster of design, of
manufacturing, of supply chain, of customers--everybody working
together is the new way to have an economic advantage.
In fact, there is a recent study done by a Chicago research
organization. I am going to read from this report. Basically, it is all
about clusters and why clusters are so important:
An industry cluster is a group of firms, related
stakeholders, and supportive institutions that gain
productive advantages from close geographic proximity and
related economies of scale. As groups of related industries
grow and develop, clustering can help lower business costs
and increase the extent of benefits of specialization. Deeper
labor pools, better access to customers and suppliers,
knowledge spillover--these and other advantages are derived
from an environment of balanced competition and
collaboration.
I could go on. I will submit it for the Record. That is what is
happening with semiconductors.
The Asian market has, basically, now become the epicenter for this
level of production, and the question is, Are we just going to forgo
that and end up, basically, with not 12 percent of market share here
but 6 percent of market share? Then our suppliers are going to continue
to go where the investments and the energy and the ideas are.
That is why in the United States of America, where we still have
clusters in various parts of the United States--my colleague from Texas
knows this well because he has a cluster in Texas. My colleague from
Oregon, who was out here earlier, knows because they have a cluster
there. There are clusters in places like Arizona. This is about whether
the United States of America is going to continue to make this
investment ourselves.
Chips are essential to our national security and to
telecommunications. In 1990, we produced over 37 percent of global chip
supply, and we need to continue to make sure that we are going to be an
investor in chip fabrication today.
Today, as I said, we are at an inflection point because of what is
happening in a global basis. According to Goldman Sachs, 169 industries
in the United States have products with embedded semiconductors, and
there will be a 20-percent shortfall of components needed for those
products.
Last month, Caterpillar, headquartered in Illinois, said it
anticipated the chip shortage impairing its ability to meet growing
demand of construction and mining equipment. We are not just talking
about kids' gaming consoles or computers. We are talking about many
sectors of our economy that depend on this.
National security experts argue that if there were a greater trade
war or military conflict, the United States would not be able to fill
its demand for chips for national security and critical infrastructure
needs.
That means people like car manufacturers, appliance manufacturers--if
you think about 5G and new technology--the post-pandemic economy won't
be able to keep moving forward.
The shortage also forced the auto sector to cut 27,000 jobs in April
alone. Earlier this year, General Motors temporarily shut down three
North American plants due to the shortage. Ford cut back Michigan
production of F-150s and the popular Explorer. And Dodge is reducing
worker schedules in a Nevada plant producing the Jeep Grand Cherokee
and Dodge Durango. These are having real-life impacts on us today.
The question is, We had a ripple of this just because of COVID. What
if we had a ripple of this because somebody decided not to supply
things to us? These are things we have to worry about just in a
national security perspective. You have to worry about whether we are
going to get a supply chain that we can depend on. We really are at an
inflection point. We are at an inflection point where we need to do
something about this sector.
One of the issues also is that chip fabrication and private R&D make
huge investments. What we are talking about here represents a very
small R&D investment partnership with the private sector as it relates
to this. We are talking about trying to get more manufacturing jobs
here in the United States.
My colleague was just discussing this sector, overall, and one of the
things that people should think about--and I am pretty sure people at
home won't be able to see this--but these jobs in production and in
various aspects of design and even on some of the other aspects, even
in management and computer, these are all well-paying jobs. These are
jobs that, literally, are the types of jobs we want to be producing in
the United States.
I heard this story about Idaho. Micron, a big company that used to be
a major chip fabrication--they are still doing chip fabrication--but
the number of jobs in Boise, ID, has fallen off, probably in the
thousands, because this production has gone to other places. Now we are
replacing them with call center jobs.
The question is whether we are going to make this investment in a key
technology critical to our national security--critical to a lot of
applications of the technology future, whether it is 5G or AI or
various things--and whether we are going to be a competitor in this
area of a supply chain and cluster that continues to innovate.
We know for a fact that semiconductor jobs in the production area are
literally $94,000 a year. That is why we are fighting for this because
it is a sector, in just the production end, that is high-paying jobs.
So are we going to spend time letting things go overseas and
basically saying, ``OK, they will allow us to have call centers,'' or
are we going to fight for these high-paying jobs in the semiconductor
space that we know will help us maintain our expertise and skill in the
United States?
I ask my colleagues to just think about the fact that this notion
that we design something here and ship it overseas for cheap production
does not fit this bill. That is not what we need to do to maintain
competitiveness, in the information age, on something as important as
semiconductors.
I think our history is rich with people like Thomas Edison and the
Edison Park, which is what we established in New Jersey, or Menlo Park,
or what now exists in Seattle or in various places. People get that
innovation happens in clusters. So, if we are going to innovate, we
have to make sure the United States is attracting this investment. We
have to make sure that we are doing this here, on our shores, with the
expertise and support.
[[Page S3848]]
A lot of my colleagues might say: Well, do you know what? Let's just
have the private sector do this R&D.
As I said, the private sector spends a lot on R&D. In fact, we think
the private sector spends about $377 billion a year on R&D. Yet, as we
know, R&D isn't just done by the private sector for its specific
interest. Basic science and lots of advanced research and applied
science are done by the United States. That is why this bill is
plussing up this number here from the National Science Foundation. We
had discussions here about plussing up the number from the Department
of Energy. Obviously, we had a vote in the Senate of even increasing
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and its dollars.
What works about the United States of America is that we are an
ecosystem. We are not a top-down. It is not like we are basically the
government, saying: This is what is going to be done. We create an
ecosystem that is really based on American know-how--our ingenuity in
how to get things done.
What we are asking for, as it relates to not only NSF funding in
order to continue the work of R&D as it relates to semiconductors, is
also to make sure that we are going to continue the focus of
manufacturing and design and R&D and development and clustering and
supply chain and companies working together.
I know how important this is because, in the Seattle area, in
Washington State, we are a leader in aerospace technology. We are 49
percent, in the United States, of aerospace manufacturing. If you don't
keep manufacturing, do you think the supply chain will stay in Seattle?
Do you think the supply chain would stay in Seattle forever--all of
those companies? We have hundreds of companies that make products for
Boeing. Do you think they would stay there if it were not there? They
will end up moving where the manufacturing is.
That is what the information age is about, and it is certainly about
that when it comes to technology products. The technology products are
developed faster, quicker, and with the innovation and the input from
their customers. That is why, if you look at these centers around the
United States, they are also the places at which you will find the
biggest users of this technology. They are there, and they are there
because they want to be close to their customers. They want to
understand their customers' needs. They want to have interaction. They
want to have collaboration.
That is what innovation is today. Innovation is doing design and
manufacturing close together. That is how we win. That is why we need
to pass this legislation as it relates to an investment in chip design
and manufacturing R&D and so we continue to attract manufacturing in
the United States.
Back to my colleague from Texas, who I know agrees with this
principle in an underlying way, when the Federal Government wants to
make an investment in actual construction, we say that we should apply
prevailing wage. I have talked to many of these people in the
semiconductor manufacturing-design space. They say: Do you see how
expensive it is to do these plans? Do you see how expensive the
equipment is? It is very expensive; so we need the best workforce. So
guess what. We pay prevailing wage.
So we are saying, because we are putting Federal dollars on the
table, we should pay prevailing wage. They think we should also pay
prevailing wage. I am not speaking for them, but, in general, they feel
like that is when they get their best product.
I know where my side of the aisle is. We are going to be here to make
an investment in this particular sector. We are going to figure out how
to be competitive against Asia in semiconductor manufacturing. We are
going to continue, as Andy Grove said, to be paranoid because we know
that this is a changing landscape, and we are going to follow our
colleagues who have made these decisions and make an investment for the
future.
I ask our colleagues to turn down the motion to strike the underlying
bill, as the underlying bill already has this provision in it, and
let's get about this business of waiving a budget point of order and
deciding to make the investment that we need to make to be competitive
in a key sector of the U.S. economy. If we do that, I guarantee you we
will be well-positioned to continue to move forward, and our national
security will be more secure because we will have made this decision.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The Senator from North Dakota
Military Appreciation Month
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to mark Military Appreciation Month
and to pay tribute to the many military members and veterans who have
sacrificed in service to our Nation.
This month provides an opportunity to show our immense gratitude to
all those who have donned a uniform in our Armed Forces. The freedoms
and blessings we enjoy as a nation have been secured by their hard work
and determination. Military Appreciation Month culminates in Memorial
Day--the date set aside to honor the men and women who have given the
ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Nation.
While we honor their memory on Memorial Day, we remember their loss
every day and extend our gratitude to their loved ones, as well as to
those who continue to serve.
We also recognize that those who serve do not serve alone. The
friends and families of those in the service of our country also serve,
and those who have lost loved ones know too well the cost of our
freedoms. I believe that we best honor and pay tribute to our military
members by thanking them, both past and present, and by ensuring they
have the resources and support they have so richly earned.
As a member of the Senate Defense and Veterans' Affairs
Appropriations Subcommittees, I have worked with my colleagues to
ensure that our veterans and military members are properly trained and
equipped and receive the care, benefits, and recognition they were
promised. Our servicemembers and their families have given much in
defense of our Nation, and the State of North Dakota, especially, has a
rich tradition of military service.
My State is home to some of the country's most premier Air Force
installations, including the Minot and Grand Forks Air Force Bases and
Cavalier Air Station. We have more than 7,300 Active-Duty
servicemembers who are currently serving in North Dakota and performing
missions that are essential to our national security. In addition, more
than 4,400 men and women serve in the North Dakota National Guard.
Currently, more than 53,000 veterans call North Dakota home.
We are grateful for the many servicemembers and veterans who have
served our country, and we honor their service every day but especially
during Military Appreciation Month. We will never forget the sacrifices
of those who gave their lives so we can enjoy the freedoms that we are
so blessed to have today and every day
Tribute to Lynn Aas and John Sinn
Mr. President, there is no better example of service and sacrifice
than that of our ``greatest generation.'' I would like to honor two
World War II veterans, as well as the Kiwanis Club of Minot, ND, of
which they have both been lifelong members. This year marks the 100th
anniversary of the Minot Kiwanis Club, as well as the 100-year
birthdays of two Kiwanis members, Mr. Lynn Aas and Mr. John Sinn.
Since its founding on May 27, 1921, the Kiwanis Club of Minot has
helped to make my home town, where I grew up, a better place to live.
As a former member myself of this organization, I deeply appreciate its
continued dedication and contributions to the community and the
surrounding area. Some examples of its work include donating books to
schools, supporting the arts, and raising money for local service
organizations like the Boy Scouts, the Juvenile Drug Court, and the
Domestic Violence Crisis Center. In these ways, Minot's local Kiwanis
chapter helps realize the mission of this international organization
and makes a real difference to families and children in the region.
For two individuals who have been lifelong members of that group, in
the very same year the organization turns 100, it is their 100th
birthdays as well. As part of the ``greatest generation'' and as World
War II veterans, Lynn Aas and John Sinn have both been important parts
of the Minot community in so many ways and have set a great example not
only in their service but

in the service they have delivered throughout their lives even after
World War II.
A native of McLean County, ND, Lynn Aas fought as a rifleman in the
historic Battle of the Bulge. He served with the 17th Airborne Division
of the 193rd Airborne Infantry and received the Bronze Star, the Purple
Heart, and the French Legion of Honour medal. Following the war, he
returned to his home State, where he earned his law degree from the
University of North Dakota.
In addition to being a lifelong Kiwanis member, he served in our
State's legislature for four sessions. He was the president of the
Minot Chamber of Commerce; served on the board for the United Way; and
has been a longtime supporter of Minot State University and of so many,
many other worthwhile things. His family and my family have been
friends for as long as I can remember--truly, a great American.
Also, John Sinn--another veteran of World War II--has his 100th
birthday as well. As a member of the 386th Infantry Regiment, John Sinn
served in the European theater, where he earned the Bronze Star. He
returned home to farm with family members in Ryder, ND, eventually
going to work for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1957.
He retired in 1989, more than 30 years ago. However, rather than
taking a well-earned rest, he has continued to serve the community as a
volunteer. Included among his volunteer efforts, he is best known for
his work to improve and maintain the Scandinavian Heritage Park--a
beautiful Scandinavian park in the community. It is truly an iconic
outdoor museum. It is central to the community's identity and is home
to the annual Norsk Hostfest, the largest celebration of Scandinavian
culture and history in North America.
The Presiding Officer is invited any time he would like to come join
us. It is a wonderful festival with wonderful food, and the best view
of the park can be found at John Sinn Outlook, which is a testament to
his many contributions.
We recognize the hard work, dedication, and service of Lynn Aas, John
Sinn, and the entire Minot Kiwanis Club as they celebrate their 100th
birthdays this year. It is therefore appropriate to take this time to
recognize their hard work, their dedication, and their service, and I
have submitted a statement honoring that today.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.
S. 1260
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am thrilled that we are passing this
legislation. It is amazing to me--and I am sure the Presiding Officer
would agree--that the Senate has actually returned to regular order. We
are passing amendments on both sides of the aisle, and I think we are
going to have a big bipartisan vote here in the Senate. In having been
here for a number of years when the Senate didn't operate that way--it
was incredibly dysfunctional--it is a great, great privilege to be here
at a moment when it is working. So I want to express my sense of
gratitude for that.
January 6 Commission
Mr. President, I also want to call the Presiding Officer's attention
to news reports this afternoon that say that our colleagues on the
Republican side of the aisle have decided they are going to block this
bipartisan Commission to examine what happened on January 6 and that
they are going to use the filibuster here to block a Commission that
some of them actually called for and a Commission that, I think, 35
Republican Members of the House of Representatives supported.
I wanted to come to the floor to appeal to their conscience and to
ask them to consider the damage that it will do to our democracy to not
have this Commission, as we have done at other important moments in the
country's history.
And, Mr. President, you were here on January 6. I was here on January
6. We had been sent here--we came here--to accomplish the ministerial
task that we are required after a Presidential election is concluded,
to certify the results of that election, to certify the ballots of
millions and millions and millions of Americans who voted in the last
election. That is why we were here.
Unfortunately, we had a President at that time who denied that the
election had actually happened.
The President will remember that we also had colleagues that came to
this floor and said that we were disrespecting the President's base or
their base because we were certifying the election, instead of having
enough respect for their base to tell them the truth, which was that
the election had been decided by millions of voters, and by every court
that looked at it and by incredibly brave local officials, many of them
Republicans, who wouldn't allow the President to push them around.
The 6th was a terrible day here. The people who invaded this Capitol,
the people who stormed the platform that had been set up for the
peaceful transfer of power on January 20, when Joe Biden took the oath
of office--the people who came here on January 6 cursed the Capitol
Police. They bludgeoned the Capitol Police. They speared them. They
hurled racial epithets, leading some of our African-American police
officers here to ask what had happened to America. They broke windows
in the Capitol. They looted the Parliamentarian's office--the people
who would bravely carry the ballots out of this Chamber, when we were
led to the Hart building, and protect those ballots that could have
ended up getting burned out on the National Mall, if they hadn't had
the presence of mind to do their job--just like the Capitol Police, who
were in mortal danger that day doing their job.
And I remember, when we were all together in one of the Senate office
buildings, after they had rushed us out of here, we would later see
that the mob was just a hallway away from here, and, actually, they
were misdirected by another Capitol Police officer, who put his life in
jeopardy to move them out of the way.
We were taken to another building, a Senate office building, and it
was in that room--we were crowded in that room. It was in that room
that I saw a scene that I never thought I would ever see as an
American, on the TV sets that were on the walls of that room. While we
were inside the room, we were watching the scene that everyone else in
the country and everyone else across the world was watching of the U.S.
Capitol being invaded by our own people.
I know the President will remember that when he was growing up, when
I was growing up, that was not an uncommon sight to see in countries
all over the world. There are a lot of countries that have had events
like January 6 over the world, especially when there have been
transitions of power or a tyrant unwilling to give up their power.
But in a million years, I would never have imagined that it would
happen here. And it did happen, and it sent a message all over the
planet.
While we were in that room, unable to certify this election, the
Chinese Government had the greatest propaganda win that you could
imagine, and in the weeks that followed, they have said democracy is in
decline, democracy is failing. That is what the Russians are saying.
That is what the Iranians are saying.
And when I was there in that room that day, I thought a lot about my
mom and her parents, who were Polish Jews, who survived the Holocaust.
The whole family was killed except for them and an aunt, and they were
lucky enough that, after the war was over, they went to Stockholm,
Sweden, for a year. They went to Mexico City for a year, and then they
came here to the only country in the world where they thought they
could rebuild their shattered lives. And they did.
And so even worse for me than the thought of our adversaries using
this to undermine democracy was the understanding that people all over
the world situated just like my mom and her parents would lose hope in
the American ideal, would lose hope in democracy and in the rule of
law.
Now, the good news is we actually had a January 20. A lot of
countries that go through January 6 never get to January 20, and we had
that, and Joe Biden took the oath of office and he became President of
the United States, and Kamala Harris became the Vice President of the
United States. We had, notwithstanding all of the prior President's
efforts to the contrary and the efforts of some of his allies in
Congress
[[Page S3850]]
to the contrary--we had--a peaceful transfer of power.
But consider how close we came, not just on the 6th, but consider
what would have happened if elected officials, many of them Republicans
in Georgia and in Arizona and in Michigan hadn't fulfilled their
obligations to the rule of law, hadn't lived up to their oath of
office, bent to the will of a President who didn't want to relinquish
power. Where would we be then?
Imagine if the Democrats, instead of winning a narrow majority in the
House of Representatives, had lost the majority in the House of
Representatives, and 140 or more--148--Republican votes to decertify
the election, to overturn the will of the voters, to disenfranchise
millions and millions and millions of Americans all of a sudden was a
majority doing that, as the former President would have wanted.
Imagine if 60 judges, many of them Republicans, appointed by
President Trump, who howled the President's lawyers out of courtroom
after courtroom, after courtroom because, instead of doing what the
President wanted them to do, instead of finding them ``a few more
votes,'' as he said to the secretary of state in Georgia, recorded on
the phone, they did their job as judges and they withstood the
pressure. They swore an oath, and they fulfilled their oath, and that
is the only way democracy can actually work. It is when elected
officials and judicial officials apply the rule of law, fulfill their
oath and their obligation.
And what I want to say to my colleagues today, I want to implore them
and appeal to their conscience, because the responsibility to the
democracy is not over. The democracy is still at risk. We still have a
President of the United States--a former President--who refuses to
concede the election, who, on a daily basis almost, says that the
election was stolen. We still have Members of Congress who are saying
the election was stolen. We still have Members of Congress who won't
face the facts and tell their constituents the truth.
I want to say again: Respect your constituents enough that you are
going to tell them the truth, and that is why, at difficult moments in
our history, like after President Kennedy was killed or the Challenger
exploded or 9/11 happened, we have had a bipartisan Commission to make
sure we understood what led us here and how we can do better coming out
of this.
It has never been perfect, but it has worked pretty well, and that is
what we need here. We need to understand what led millions of Americans
to believe conspiracy theories about our own country and what led
thousands of people to storm the Capitol of the United States, to
attack police officers, to attack police officers, leading to their
death.
From all over the country, they came to invade this Capitol, and if
we don't want it to happen again or we want to be able to protect
ourselves, and I am not just talking about the poor Capitol Police,
although that, at a bare minimum, ought to be enough to warrant a
Commission. I am talking about the danger of political violence in this
Nation going forward if we don't address this and the American people
don't have the chance to understand what happened.
As I mentioned, that night on January 6, standing at this desk on the
floor, political violence is what brings these republics to an end.
I am going to finish because I know there are others who want to
speak, but let me just finish by saying how agonizing it was to watch
Officer Sicknick's mom here today, going door to door to door, to ask
people: Please vote for this Commission.
I hope that people will reconsider. I hope they will search their
conscience. The people around the world who watched January 6 are
watching us today, and they want to know if democracy is up to the
challenges of the 21st century.
I believe it is. I believe it is. I think democracy is the highest
expression of humanity on Earth, and we are being tested in all kinds
of ways right now, externally and internally. This would give us the
chance to at least deal with the internal question. And I think at a
moment like this it is important for us not to stand for a party or for
a President but for the truth and for common sense and for our exercise
in self-government.
For all of those reasons, I hope that when we have the vote tonight,
that it will succeed and the American people will have the benefit of a
bipartisan Commission to examine what happened on January 6 and help us
understand how we can strengthen our democracy.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.
Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 478 and S. 789 En Bloc
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, the Senate has a solemn duty to exercise
and fulfill U.S. Federal trust responsibility. This duty is the guiding
principle for all our work on behalf of American Indians, Alaska
Natives, and Native Hawaiians. So as the chairman of the Senate
Committee on Indian Affairs, it is my job to prioritize and push Tribal
and Native communities' legislative priorities toward the finish line
and ultimately to actually enact legislation.
The Indian Affairs Committee has a strong tradition of bipartisanship
going back decades. Committee Members on both sides of the aisle
routinely work together to achieve their own Native communities' goals.
When there are disagreements, we do everything we can to work them out
internally and to find common ground so that Members aren't forced to
air their disagreements when bills get to the floor.
In fact, just last night, the Senate passed eight Indian Affairs
bills unanimously. Those bills would, among other things, promote
economic development, protect Native children, honor Tribal self-
determination--goals that we all agreed take important steps toward
fulfilling our shared Federal trust responsibilities. Time and again,
we have shown that the Indian Affairs bills can rise above partisan
logjams. That compromise can be found. But here we are.
H.R. 478, which passed the House on May 12, 2021, under suspension of
the rules, would help to rebuild Tribal homelands; and S. 789, which
passed the Senate unanimously in late November 2019, would repeal 11
obsolete, racist, unenforced laws that are inconsistent with the
current government-to-government relationship enjoyed by the United
States and Indian Tribes.
Both bills would likely be laws by now if the COVID-19 pandemic had
not disrupted our legislative work last year. These bills are good
policy. That is why both Republican and Democratic administrations
support them.
And the Senate should have passed these bills last night, but because
there was an objection to their inclusion in the 10-bill package, we
find ourselves here again. The Indian Affairs Committee, as is
tradition, has negotiated in good faith to clear up any concerns there
may be, but those efforts were not successful, which leads me to this
moment.
When it comes to fulfilling the U.S. trust responsibility, there is
no room for partisanship.
So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate
consideration of the following bills en bloc: Calendar No. 59, H.R.
478, the Blackwater Trading Post Land Transfer Act; and Calendar No.
53, S. 789, the RESPECT Act; further, that the bills be considered read
a third time and passed en bloc and the motions to reconsider be
considered made and laid upon the table en bloc, with no intervening
action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
The Senator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, one of the
bills in question--specifically, H.R. 478, would direct the Secretary
of the Interior to take 55.3 acres of land owned by the Gila River
Indian Community into trust.
The Gila River Indian Community Reservation is already 583 square
miles, with a population of 11,000. The Gila River Indian Community
already owns this land, so why we need to take more land into trust and
have the Federal Government more involved in the management of the land
is not immediately obvious or apparent to me. The answer is not at all
clear as to why it needs to be in trust.
Trust land responsibilities for the Federal Government are
significant and before we expand the size of our trust lands, we have
to have an understanding of what we are doing and the actual need to do
it
[[Page S3851]]
Proponents of this legislation have claimed that the Tribe has a
unique history with this particular plot of land--this particular 55.3
acres of land--adjacent to the trust land. But from the history shown,
the Tribe's interaction with the land is mostly that they have had
friendly neighbors with whom they have traded goods.
As many of my colleagues are aware, I have great concerns that I have
quite consistently expressed with further expanding the Federal
Government's management or involvement in public lands, including trust
lands.
Nevertheless, I have been engaging in negotiations, and I have made a
number of good-faith efforts to develop a possible path forward--one in
which the amount of acreage owned or held in trust by the Federal
Government would not grow, while taking this land into trust for the
Gila River Indian Community. While I continue to negotiate a path
forward, I am not inclined to abandon this concern. This is a
negotiation that has been in progress.
That said, with respect to the part of the request dealing
specifically with S. 789, the RESPECT Act, I am willing to let that go.
But if the request is to pass both of these by unanimous consent, I
can't support that, and on that basis, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
The Senator from Hawaii.
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, a couple of points. On taking 55.3 acres
into trust, this is not like the Federal Government is going to have
new land management responsibilities. This is a matter of principle for
the Senator from Utah, and I recognize that; that he thinks, basically,
no additional land should be taken into trust, even though this
government-to-government relationship--this authority over these
government relationships are enshrined in the Constitution of the
United States and this government-to-government relationship has
already been established by statutory law and the process for putting
land into trust is already a well-established pathway. But what the
Senator from Utah is saying is no more or we are going to have to do a
one-for-one swap or even sometimes a two-for-one swap. You cannot have
a net increase in the acreage, even if it is 53 acres, even if there is
an established process.
And so, I do find that difficult to work with. I know that the
Senators from Arizona are in discussions with the Senator from Utah.
We will find our way forward. This is 53 acres. It is important,
obviously. We are going to enact this legislation.
I like the Senator from Utah. We will find a way on this one.
But if he would entertain an amendment to the request, then I would
be pleased to pass the RESPECT Act by voice vote, if that is something
that the Senator from Utah would be amenable to.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. I fully am amenable to that, with the RESPECT Act
