 Oh Confidently I did the thing a woman like me should never do I stepped on a scale and fought with the hell Cuz honey that scale was mighty rude So I gained a little weight Mama's hair's a little grey and my strangers. They're the same Believe me when I say I fight a bear underwater for my baby Bring on a lion. I'm not riding. They can't take me I tell the stripes of any tiger you just call me and that's where I'm right there And I'm not scared The lions and tigers and men Oh Before a fox please a big jab a walkie. It's just got a knock on your mama's door I fight through the fire, but if there's a spider We're honey, that's what your friends are for. I know sometimes we don't agree But I'm always on your team and if somebody's ever me If they try to take a swing, I'm gonna hit that gangsta lean somebody hold my rings Let me get that Vaseline cuz they don't have to go through me I fight the rail on this monster for my baby I play the dragon and I drag them cuz I'm crazy I scare the stripes of any color. Do you call me and that's where I'm right there And I'm not scared And I'm not scared You Thank you so much for watching.
