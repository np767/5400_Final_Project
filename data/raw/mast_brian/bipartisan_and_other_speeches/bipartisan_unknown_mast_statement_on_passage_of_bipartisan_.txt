Mast Statement on Passage of Bipartisan Defense Funding Bill
U.S. Congressman Brian Mast (FL-21) issued the following statement regarding the passage of the
Fiscal Year 2026 Defense Appropriations Bill
and the inclusion of priorities such as funding for Army Black Hawk helicopter and Navy and Air Force C-130Js procurements and modernization, glioblastoma medical research, and humanitarian demining research:
“This bill is about making sure our nation’s men and women in uniform have the best equipment, technology, and support we can offer. We’re sending a clear bipartisan message that America backs our troops with more than just words as these investments will keep our military strong, our homeland secure, and reaffirms our commitment to those who serve us.”
