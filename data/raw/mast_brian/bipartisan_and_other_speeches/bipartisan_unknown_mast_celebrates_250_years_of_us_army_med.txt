Mast Celebrates 250 Years of U.S. Army Medicine
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Congressman Brian Mast
today announced a resolution honoring 250 years of U.S. Army Medicine. The resolution recognizes the generations of American medical professionals who have served with Army soldiers since the nation’s founding.
“Our U.S. Army medics have been saving lives on the frontlines of every conflict in American history,” said
Rep. Brian Mast
. “From the Revolutionary War to today’s battlefields, these men and women have stood with our troops, giving lifesaving care to those in uniform and advancing medicine for the entire world. I personally owe them my life, and I will always be grateful for their dedication to protecting America’s servicemembers.”
“For 250 years, Army Medicine has stood shoulder to shoulder with America’s warfighters, returning our combat wounded back to the fight, to their families, and to a grateful nation. As we lean into our next 250 years, we remember our ‘why.’ We inspire trust and confidence in soldiers and their families, that the best combat ready care in the world is with them both at home and on the battlefield.” said
Lt. Gen. Mary K. Izaguirre, Surgeon General of the U.S. Army
.
Over the last 250 years, Army doctors, nurses, medics, researchers, and staff have provided care in combat, field hospitals, and humanitarian missions across the world. Army medicine has pioneered innovations in trauma care, prosthetics, and disease prevention. And institutions like Walter Reed Army Institute of Research have contributed to groundbreaking discoveries in treatments and vaccines as they work to save the lives of both servicemembers, veterans, and civilians.
