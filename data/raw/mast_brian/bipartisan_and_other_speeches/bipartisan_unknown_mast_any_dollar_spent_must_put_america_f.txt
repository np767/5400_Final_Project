Mast: Any Dollar Spent Must Put America First
Washington, D.C.
- U.S. Congressman Brian Mast (FL-21) released the following statement after the passage of  H.R. 4, the Rescissions Act of 2025:
“The American people are done with the corrupt spending spree of the far-left, and I’m proud of the work the Foreign Affairs Committee did to bring these egregious programs to light. For years, Democrats have spent the money of hard-working Americans on programs that do not serve the best interests of the American people. Even in the final days of Joe Biden’s disastrous term, they shoveled as much money as possible out the door to their favorite liberal causes. That ends now. Together with President Trump, we’ll make sure that any dollar spent puts America first.”
