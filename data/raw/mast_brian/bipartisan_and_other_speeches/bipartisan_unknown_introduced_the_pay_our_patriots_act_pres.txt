INTRODUCED: The Pay Our Patriots Act
After forty-three days—the longest shutdown in American history—the federal government has reopened. Throughout this federal lapse in appropriations,
we watched Democrats talk about our service members’ paychecks as leverage to score their own political points
.
This was appalling. Servicemembers should never be used in partisan negotiations. They should never have to wonder whether they’ll get paid in the face of Congressional dysfunction.
That’s why today I introduced the
Pay Our Patriots Act
—a straightforward piece of legislation that
guarantees pay for essential members of our Armed Forces, Coast Guard, and Air Traffic Controllers during any future federal shutdown
.
Here’s what this bill does:
Guarantees pay for essential members of the Armed Forces, Coast Guard, and Air Traffic Controllers during any lapse in government funding.
Removes their pay from political bargaining, so servicemembers are never used as leverage.
Protects America’s readiness by allowing essential officials to stay committed to their mission and not distracted by whether or not they’ll receive a paycheck.
The people who defend us, keeping our skies safe and serving our country, deserve better than to be treated like bargaining chips. By ensuring that they’re paid, we guarantee America’s security.
This bill is about putting our national defense first and honoring the commitment of those who reported to duty every single day—whether or not they’d be fairly compensated.
