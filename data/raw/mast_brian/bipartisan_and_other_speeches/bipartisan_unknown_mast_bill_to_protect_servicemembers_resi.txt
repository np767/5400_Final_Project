Mast Bill to Protect Servicemembers' Residences Passes House Floor
Washington, D.C.
–
Today,
U.S. Congressman Brian Mast’s
bill to protect service members from squatters’ rights laws has passed the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill,
H.R. 2334, the
Servicemember Residence Protection Act
, now moves on to the Senate for a vote.
“I am pleased to see this bill pass the House floor today—it’s another step to put America’s heroes first. The brave men and women serving our country have more than enough to worry about when they come home from deployment. Evicting a squatter should not be anywhere on the list,”
said
Rep. Brian Mast
.
The bill amends the Servicemembers’ Civil Relief Act (SCRA), adding a provision that frees service members’ residences from squatters’ rights constraints. Varying by state, squatters’ rights generally allow trespassers to claim ownership of a property if it is open, unoccupied, and their stay is continuous.
Evicting a squatter requires legal intervention, which is often unfeasible or impossible during deployment. This bill cuts the red tape and helps service members who are uniquely susceptible to inconsistent housing situations with prolonged absences, relocations, and frequent transitions. The bill would ensure active-duty military personnel who find a squatter in their home do not have to undergo the stressful obstacles required to evict these individuals.
