Mast joins EPA & Army Corps to unveil clear, durable WOTUS proposal
Washington, D.C. –
U.S. Congressman Brian Mast
joined U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, to announce a proposed rule that would establish a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.
“Having a durable, consistent, and clear definition of WOTUS is essential to lowering costs for Americans, promoting economic growth, and the environment. The federal government does have a role to play in responsible water policy, but it should not be regulating every puddle in our backyards,” said
Rep. Brian Mast
.
“On the Treasure Coast, our federal and local partnerships work to regulate our water in ways that work best for our community. This much-needed proposal reinforces those relationships, giving more authority back to the states like Florida, who are experts when it comes to our own local water. From lakes to estuaries to water runoff, no one cares more about the water than the communities whose livelihoods rely on it.”
For too long, Democrat Administrations have weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American landowners, entrepreneurs, and families. The proposal, unveiled at an event at EPA headquarters in Washington, DC,  follows the Sackett Supreme Court decision and gives power back to the American people. It delivers on the Trump Administration's commitment to protect America's waters while supporting those across our nation who feed and fuel the world.
