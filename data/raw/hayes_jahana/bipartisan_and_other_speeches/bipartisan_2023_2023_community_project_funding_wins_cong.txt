This project would be a valuable use of taxpayer funds because it will revitalize a currently abandoned interstate railway line known as the Beacon Line by restoring commuter services to satisfy an ever-expanding need. The plan calls for extending the current New York City Metro North Harlem Line rail which now terminates in Southeast, NY and providing a new connection to the Beacon Line and adding two stops in Danbury, CT. The restoration of commuter rail service would extend the existing public transportation network and provide benefits to all communities along the corridor by connecting residents more easily to New York City. It is possible the restoration of service will reduce private vehicle volumes on Interstate
84, Interstate 684
, and local roadways along the interstate roadway corridors. Lower vehicle counts could result in less vehicular congestion and emissions, and would have a lasting impact on the community.

New Fairfield Police Department, Town of
Full Street Address of the Intended Recipient:

Financial Disclosure Letter
Explanation of the Request:
This project would be a valuable use of taxpayer funds because communications systems are the backbone of any safety program and combined with New Fairfield’s location and proximity to Candlewood Lake and the New York border, interoperability between localities is a critical component of emergency preparedness. In New Fairfield’s vicinity lie significant infrastructure critical to the state, including Candlewood Lake, a 5,420 manmade lake that provides hydroelectric storage for Rocky River Power Plant (FirstLight Power Company). Small towns like New Fairfield and its immediate neighbors depend on shared resources and mutual aid during emergencies, and this upgrade will allow for interoperable communications not only with other towns but with state agencies. This will be an overall benefit to this more rural area of the state that lacks some of the more robust infrastructure seen in our larger communities.
