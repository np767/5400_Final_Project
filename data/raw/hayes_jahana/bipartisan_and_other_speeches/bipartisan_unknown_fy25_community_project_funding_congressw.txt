NORFOLK
Project Name:
Norfolk Firehouse Project
Request Amount:
$500,000
Intended Recipient:
Town of Norfolk, Connecticut
Full Street Address of the Intended Recipient:
19 Maple Ave, Norfolk, CT 06058
Financial Disclosure Letter
Explanation of the Request:
The project is an appropriate use of taxpayer funds because the current facility is too small and lacks many of the health and safety that are common in new firehouses. The distance between the equipment is too small, making it dangerous for volunteers when there is a fire call and trucks are exiting the building. The facility also lacks an adequate ventilation system to extract the exhaust gases from the trucks, forcing Norfolk Firehouse volunteers to hold general meetings or training sessions outside. It was difficult for first responders to respond during emergencies such as the 8200-gallon gas spill in November '22 and flooding in July of '23 because of the current facility. The grant will help cover the costs of constructing a new facility.

The Committee on Appropriations is soliciting Community Project Funding requests for Fiscal Year 2025. Community Project Funding allows Members of Congress to use knowledge of their districts and stakeholder input to make the case for directing taxpayer dollars to specific projects at home. This is a significant tool to address pressing local needs in Member districts and creates a pathway to targeted funding. This is also an excellent opportunity to help direct critical federal resources back to the Fifth District for important local initiatives.
Community Projects are funded on a limited basis with each Member being limited to no more than 15 requests. Projects will be selected by my office based on financial need for the initiative, strength and completion of application, level of improvement the project would contribute to the local community, and community support. While Members of Congress may make up to 15 requests, the Committee is not obligated to accept or fulfill any minimum number of requests per Member. Submitting a request for a Community Project on behalf of your community or organization does not ensure the request will be granted. My office will make every effort to support selected projects and advocate for inclusion in the final appropriations budget.
Under the guidance issued by the Committee, project recipients must be government or nonprofit organizations to be considered eligible. Submissions from for-profit organizations will not be considered. Community engagement and support are crucial in determining which projects should be awarded federal funding. Evidence of community support, that serves as compelling factors in the decision to submit project requests will be required as part of submission. This may include letters of support from municipal leaders, demonstrated support from state agencies or constituent groups, or articles in local papers regarding the importance of the requested project. Additionally, for some accounts there may be matching funding requirements.
Non-profit organizations are no longer eligible for Community Project Funding in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Economic Development Initiative (EDI) account.
