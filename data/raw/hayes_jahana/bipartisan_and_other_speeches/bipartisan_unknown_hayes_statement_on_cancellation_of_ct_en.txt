WASHINGTON, D.C.
– Today,
Congresswoman Jahana Hayes (CT-05)
released the following statement on
reports
that Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought will terminate energy projects in 16 states across the country, including in Connecticut.
“In what amounts to a targeted partisan attack this Administration plans to cancel nearly $8 billion in funding for climate-related projects in mostly Democrat led states including Connecticut. This will result in layoffs and rising energy costs. The move also raises concern about Russ Vought once again recklessly and unilaterally clawing back funds that Congress has voted on.”
“Connecticut residents are already dealing with the rising cost of living and cannot afford increasing energy bills.”
