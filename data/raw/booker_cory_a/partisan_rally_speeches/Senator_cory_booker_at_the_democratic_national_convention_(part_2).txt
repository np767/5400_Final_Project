 In this great nation where our founders put a fundamental principle forward of religious freedom, he says ban all Muslims. Don't let certain people into our America because of how they pray. Now I take particular interest in the fact that Trump says he would run our country like he's run his businesses. Well I'm from Jersey and I'm from the Great Garden State and we've seen how he leads in Atlantic City. He got rich while his companies declared multiple bankruptcy yet without remorse even as people got hurt and lost jobs by his failures he bragged and I quote the money I took out of there was incredible yes he took out a lot of cash but he stiffed contractors many of them small businesses refusing to refusing to pay them for the work that they've done you know we in America have seen enough of a handful of people growing rich at the cost of a nation descending into crisis America at our best we stand up to bullies and we fight those who seek to demean and degrade other Americans in times of crisis we don't abandon our values we double down on them even amidst the crisis of the civil war Lincoln stood up and called out to all of our country saying with malice towards none and charity towards all this is our history this is a history that I was taught by parents never wanted my brother and I to get too heavy gratitude was our gravity so they never stopped reminding my brother and I that our blessings sprang from countless ordinary Americans who showed extra ordinary acts of kindness decency and love people who struggle and sweat and blood for our rights people who pay the ultimate price for the freedoms we all enjoy I was told that we can't pay those Americans black back for their colossal acts of service but we have an obligation to pay it forward to others through our service and our sacrifice I support Hillary Clinton because these are her values and she has been paying it forward her entire life long before long before she got in politics she was in Massachusetts going door to door collecting the stories of children with disabilities in South Carolina she fought to reform the juvenile justice system so that children wouldn't be thrown in adult prisons in Alabama she helped expose the remnants of segregation in school in Arkansas she started a legal aid clinic to make sure poor folks could get their day in court she has fought for the people and she's delivered that's why we trust her to fight and deliver for us as president but let me tell you we have a presidential nominee in Clinton who knows that in a time of stunningly wide disparities of wealth in our nation that America's greatness must not be measured by how many millionaires and billionaires we have but how few people we have living in poverty Hillary knows that when workers make a fair wage it doesn't just help their families it builds a stronger and more durable economy that expands opportunity makes all of us Americans wealthier she knows that in a global knowledge-based economy the country that out educates the world will out earn the world out innovate the world and will lead the world she knows that debt-free college is not a gift it's not charity it is an investment it represents the best of our values the best of our history and the best of our party all of our shared ideas and values together Hillary Clinton knows that when we pain have paid family leave that this is something that must happen because when a parent doesn't have to choose between being there for a sick child and paying went or when a single mom or parents and equal wage for equal work it empowers the most important building block in all of our nation and that is the family Hillary Clinton knows that security doesn't come from scapegoating other people because of their religion alienating our allies stoking fear and pointing fingers it comes when we band together to face down and defeat our common enemy and she knows something that I fight for every day that our criminal justice system desperately needs reform that we need to bring back fairness to a system that still as Professor Brian Stevenson says treats you better if you are rich and guilty than poor and innocent and she knows that we can be a nation that both believes police officers deserve more respect they deserve more support more cooperation and love and believe that a black 20 something year old protestor deserves to be valued deserves to be heard that they should be listened to with more courageous empathy and that change is needed in the system and Hillary Clinton knows what Donald Trump betrays time and time again in this campaign that we are not a zero-sum nation it is not you or me it is not one America against another American it is you and I together interdependent interconnected with one single interwoven destiny when we respect each other when we stand up for each other when we work together against our challenges against our neighbors challenges be it a neighbor with a beautiful special needs child or one struggling with the ugly disease of addiction when we as Americans help them when we show compassion and grace when we evidence our truth that we are the United States of America one nation under God indivisible that is when we are stronger that is when we go from an already great America to an even greater American now let me tell you let me tell you right now when Trump stews insulting and demeaning words about our fellow Americans I think of that poem by Maya Angelou you all know it you know how it begins you may write me down in history with your bitter twisted lies you may trod me in the very dirt but still like dust I rise well y'all know it y'all know it this this captures our American history 240 years ago an English king said he would crush our rebellion but Americans from around our nation joined the fight from bunker hill to the battle of trendon they stood and so many fell giving their lives in support of our darel or daring declaration that America we will rise this is our history this is our history escape slave knowing that liberty is not secure for some until it's secure for all sometimes hungry often hunted in dark woods and deep swaps they looked up to the north star said with a determined whisper America we will rise immigrants immigrants risking their lives in times of sweatshops and child labor they organized labor unions and devoted themselves to lifting the tired the poor and the huddle masses with fiercest of grit they shouted so all could hear America we will rise king pointed to the mountaintop Kennedy pointed to the moon from Sennaka fall to those who stood at stone wall in giants before us said in a chorus of conviction America we will rise my fellow Americans my fellow Americans we cannot fall into the complacency or indifference about this election because still the only thing necessary for evil to be triumphant is for good people to do nothing you know the same my fellow Americans we cannot be seduced by citizen about our politics because citizen is a refuge for cowards and this nation is and must always be the home of the brave we are the United States of America we will not falter or fall we will not retreat or surrender our values we will not surrender our ideas we will not surrender the moral high ground here in Philadelphia let us declare again that we will be a free people free from fear and intimidation let us declare again that we are a nation of interdependence and that in America love always trumps hate let us declare let us declare so that generations get on board can hear us we are the United States of America our best days are ahead of us and together with Hillary Clinton as our president America we will rise God bless America let us rise together God bless America
