RECOGNIZING AMIRAM COOPER
(Ms. BALINT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to share the story of
Amiram Cooper.
Amiram is 85, a husband, a father, a grandfather of nine, a composer,
and a poet. His love for the arts and writing inspires everyone around
him.
On October 7, he was 1 of more than 240 men, women, children, and
elderly who were kidnapped by Hamas.
Amiram was one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of the sites of
this horrible attack. This tight-knit community was left devastated by
the brutality of that day.
Amiram and 135 others are still held captive in Gaza today. Their
families continue to live a nightmare--devastated, not knowing what
conditions their loved ones are in. It has been 123 days.
We must demand that medical and aid organizations be able to treat
the hostages and negotiate on their behalf.
We must continue to do everything in our power to keep these hostages
and their families in our hearts and to keep telling their stories.
We must bring every single hostage home and end this violence.
