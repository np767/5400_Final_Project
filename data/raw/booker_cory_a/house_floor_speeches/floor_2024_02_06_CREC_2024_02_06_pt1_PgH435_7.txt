EVERY MONTH IS BLACK HISTORY MONTH
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I want everyone to know and to be very clear
that every month in the 12th Congressional District is Black History
Month.
I was born and raised in the most beautiful, Blackest city in the
country: the city of Detroit. Countless Black leaders, our neighbors,
have inspired us all to seek change in the face of segregation, Jim
Crow, economic injustices, and dehumanizing racism.
We bore witness in our city to Dr. King's first Walk to Freedom and
the transformative work of so many of our Black trailblazers, like
Mother Rosa Parks, James Boggs, Reverend Franklin, and so many others.
It was on our very streets that the fight for Black liberation and
civil rights bent the arc of the moral universe in our Nation. From the
iconic Motown sound to powerful activism, our community's Black history
has a remarkable legacy.
The 12th District acknowledges that Black history and Black lives
matter every single day of the year.
Please know that you will also have a fighter in me in the United
States Congress.
