POSTAL SERVICE FOR RURAL AMERICA
(Ms. BALINT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, let me just say may the
record show the Vermonter is here. Snow across D.C.; the Vermonter is
here.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a voice for rural America. In Vermont's
capital city, Montpelier, we do not have a functioning post office.
This is completely unacceptable.
The post office is a vital, nonnegotiable part of our communities. It
is part of the fabric of rural America. Seniors depend on it, small
businesses depend on it, and our downtowns depend on it to keep our
communities vibrant and connected.
Vermonters are frustrated, and rightly so, not only because they have
been denied reliable, accessible service, but because the USPS has
failed to give us any answers as we try to rectify this failure.
Vermonters are not asking much. A fully functional post office in a
State's capital city is not a big ask. We must get back to making
government work for the people at its most basic functions.
When we ignore this need, we continue to erode faith in the
government, and we leave communities behind. I won't stop raising my
voice until reliable Postal Service is restored in Montpelier, Vermont,
and in other parts of rural America.
