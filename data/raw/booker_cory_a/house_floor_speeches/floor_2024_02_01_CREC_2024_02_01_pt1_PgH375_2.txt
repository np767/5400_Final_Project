CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF AMP FIDDLER
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life and legacy of
Joseph ``Amp'' Fiddler as we mourn his passing.
Amp Fiddler was born in Detroit and grew up surrounded by the sounds
of Motown, rock, jazz, funk, and electronic music.
His big break came when he joined the legendary George Clinton
Parliament Funkadelic. It was during this time that Amp honed his
skills on the keyboard and synthesizers, contributing significantly to
the band's distinctive sound.
Fiddler collaborated with many notable artists, like Prince and is
credited with helping launch the pioneering hip-hop sounds of our own
Detroit's legendary J Dilla.
He enjoyed a long and successful solo career, marked by his
distinctive blend of funk and contemporary sounds. Fiddler always
remained humble and dedicated to his craft and our community.
Please join me in recognizing Amp Fiddler, a true guiding force for
Detroit's musical culture as we mourn his loss.
