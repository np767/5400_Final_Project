U.S. Senator Katie Britt Releases Statement Following Unanimous Senate Passage of Epstein Files Bill
November 18, 2025
WASHINGTON, D.C.
— U.S. Senator Katie Britt (R-Ala.) today released a statement following the Senate unanimously passing H.R. 4405, the
Epstein Files Transparency Act
, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives earlier today by a vote of 427-1.
“I’m grateful to see the Senate unanimously pass the House bill to release the Epstein Files tonight. I’ve been a longtime supporter of releasing the files and previously supported an amendment in the Senate Fiscal Year 2026 Appropriations Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Act requiring the Attorney General to submit a full report and findings to Congress. Next stop: President Trump’s desk, where he will sign the bill into law.
“Let’s be clear—for Democrats, this was never about the victims. Under Joe Biden, Democrats did nothing to facilitate the release of these files, while Republicans have been calling for the release for years. And just last week, they blocked a motion for unanimous consent to release these files, once again, putting politics over people. Jeffrey Epstein was a sick and twisted pedophile who is responsible for irreparable harm to countless victims—full stop. Today’s passage in both chambers of Congress was a historic step to ensuring justice for Epstein’s victims and transparency for the American people.”
