 Arts through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming In the rock as red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there O say does that star-spangled Ben-niad wave O'er the land of the free And the home of the brave Wow, how about that? Oh my goodness, can you hear us in the back? Alright, I want to say thank you for all of you for being here on this historic night in the state of Alabama. It's a real honor to be up here Introducing Alabama's next US Senator I am proud to endorse Katie Britt and I'm glad to be standing alongside her in a few minutes With her and her wonderful family We are very proud of them as all of us are in this room For those who don't know me, I am Senator Garland Gudger I represent Winston County Lawrence County, Marion County, and my home, Coleman County That's right, I like the Coleman in the house I saw Roy Drinkard over here, a hundred and war of war vet, and Marine over here, turning 102 Next month, the Mayor Woody Jacobs here, Austin Niels here, the Wootens are here, so we're representing in Coleman I have an honor of representing all of District 4 in the state of Alabama And what I've learned from being in the Senate is that we need the next generation of Christian conservatives to stand up And that's exactly what Katie is doing for us If you know Katie well, then you know her faith, you know her heart, and that she is a true and real leader She and Wesley have been and will continue to fight for Alabama's future And you know what guys, that's the fun part, because the future of Alabama looks bright after tonight Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, your next US Senator, please join me and welcome Katie Britt Wow, oh my goodness, nobody wants to end that song Guys, wow, wow, wow, thank you Alabama You all did it Thank you, we did it You did it That's right, that's right, you got it, I love it, I love it You all first and foremost, I want to thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Number one, without him nothing is possible This morning I was reading the scripture that you gave me, Jamie And this morning's was Romans 828 And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him Who have been called according to his purpose Last night when you said the prayer uncle Mike, you said they answered the call They may not have wanted to, but they answered his call When I read more about the scripture, it said every single thing, the hard stuff, the hard breaks, the hurdles He uses it all for your healing Everything is in preparation for your purpose, no matter how it feels, trust that he is using it for your good Faith is walking forward trusting his character Folks, amen to that When we got in this race, nobody thought this was possible I mean, unless you were related to me or in a very small circle You didn't think that this could be done As Wesley and I prayed about it and prayed about it and prayed about it some more We knew we were the underdog And that actually may even be an understatement We were told by pretty much everyone, everywhere This was an insurmountable task and do not take it on But ultimately the two of us believe in this state We believe in this nation and we believe both are worth fighting for So as people said, you can't win People said this will be David versus Goliath Do you not realize you're up against a sitting congressman who is pulling above 60% I responded with what I'm pulling it for And that's right, you got to start somewhere I had a gentleman correct me and say I don't mean to embarrass you but I saw a pull and you're actually at two So I was told you're too young, wait your turn Wait for this one, this is one of my favorites You're from the wrong part of the state Everybody knows I love being from the wire grass so that just fired me on out of here And the last one that I got a lot was but you're a mom And I will say that that is exactly what drove me off the sideline I have said I am a mama on a mission And the two reasons that Wesley and I chose to jump in this race are standing right beside us We know they're worth fighting for Your children, your grandchildren are worth fighting for Alabama's future is worth fighting for and this nation is worth fighting for As our children reminded us early on, God calls us to do hard things Well I'll be honest with you, it still hasn't sunk in that we actually did a really hard thing I will tell you this though tonight, me standing in front of you is proof that the American dream is alive And we're running to preserve that for your children I mean that dream allowed this public school girl from the wire grass The daughter of two small business owners who watched her parents work six and seven days a week to make ends meet Someone who worked herself through college got to law school and had newborn two little ones Landed jobs I never dreamed I could have and now standing before you as the Republican nominee for the United States One thing is clear and that is Alabama has spoken We want new blood, we want fresh blood, we want someone who will fight for our Christian conservative values Who will fight for the freedoms and liberty this nation was founded on and will fight for that American dream for the next generation and the next I will say this, this campaign has never been about me, it has always been about you And I am looking across this room y'all and I am blown away I'm seeing people from Jackson County and Baldwin County and co-workers from Birmingham and everyone in between Thank you for stepping up, thank you for being here, thank you for helping me in this journey I will say this, we knew this was about the future of the state and the future of the nation And so as Wesley and I drove a course all 67 counties and I like to say that Wesley ate his way through all 60 states Right? I told him he needs to write a book of all the great places to eat in Alabama But as we have been through this incredible state we have been moved by people's stories It is the veterans that I set with in East of Hoga in Talladega County who told me their story, look at that, I love it Who told me their stories, not only of how they served our nation honorably but the challenges that are in front of them today It's about the children and someter county at university charter school who we know now have a path of hope and a future Because of the investment that that community has chosen to make Everything from the little ones to the high school seniors realize that no child zip code should determine their opportunity And that school is helping make that a reality It is for the parents, that's right It is for the parents who have shared their tragedies with me who have talked to me about their children committing suicide Who have talked to me about opioid overdoses and have talked to me about unfortunately losing loved ones to fit in all overdoses Folks, it's to the retired gentleman who I met at the gas station in Shulton County who said I worked my whole life I did everything they told me to and now I'm having to pick up this job at night just to make ends meet It is to the farmers and I see you all out there. Thank you You Who have talked to me about overburdened some regulation in taxes and their fear of not being able to pass along the family farm to the next generation This is for you What I want you to know all the incredible people that we have met across this state you have shared with us your hopes, your dreams, your fears, your concerns, your challenges and your opportunities Too often we have politicians that come down and lecture us instead of listen And what I want you to know is I hear you And tonight I think it is safe to say that America has heard Alabama too And now the next step is to send Joe Biden a message in November I am looking forward to working alongside my fellow Republican nominees across the country to retake the House and the Senate So we can once again put America first I'd like to thank Congressman Brooks for his service and his commitment to that shared mission He ran a hard fought campaign and I look forward to working hard to earn the support of his voters in November And before I get to some much deserved thank yous I want to make sure you know a couple of things One I love this state I believe in this state we have incredible people and we have a wonderful story to tell I am honored that you would allow me to be a part of telling that story As your next United States senator I will work tirelessly to grow 21st century opportunity for all Alabamaans regardless of their zip code That is what the American dream is all about I promise you I will work nonstop to defend our values and to defend our people And speaking of there are a lot of people who made tonight possible Oh my gosh it's all my nieces and nephews I was wondering who was giving me some feedback right here It's to leave it up to family to keep it real with you And a cousin that's right speaking of my family I'm going to start with that first Wesley Bennett Ridgeway and my parents They have all sacrificed a great deal this year Wesley as many of you know and I'm going to say this because I realized last time when we were up here That the people at home didn't get to see Wesley's head So for those of you who are watching he is the gentleman right above the line here So they said you have such a nice backdrop I'm like did the flags look great they were like no it was just Wesley's chest So you know but Wesley resigned from his job for us to do this And you all know that is never in the financial plan at 40 years old But he is the rock of our family and he has been with us step by step by step Wesley Brett I couldn't do this without you I am so proud I am so proud you chose me to be your wife and I am just so grateful for you Kids these two right here Ridgeway Bennett come here They have literally grown so much this year At the beginning of the campaign they were here and now they've moved to here But literally and figuratively you have shown such grace and strength We all remember what middle school was like and you add this additional layer onto it I am so proud that you remain grounded in your faith and your love for this country And that you're willing to step up and help us in this endeavor We love you all So to my parents who have done everything filled all the gaps Yaya everybody in here knows yaya at this point Yaya and Papa we couldn't have done it without you I know as a parent one of the greatest challenges is watching your children struggle Watching them be an unfortunate situation and boy have you had to do that this year I am so grateful for the foundation you laid with me that of faith And the tools that you gave me those tools that you equipped me with growing up making me work at six and seven years old and moving on They're the exact tools that got me through this last year and I'm so grateful for the two of you Hello So all right so God bless me with an incredible family incredible and laws I see them all back here Cousins and uncles everyone thank you You all stepped up answered the call no matter what it is that we needed on both sides of the family We are so grateful for you and thank you for supporting me at every turn And last my sisters where are they?
