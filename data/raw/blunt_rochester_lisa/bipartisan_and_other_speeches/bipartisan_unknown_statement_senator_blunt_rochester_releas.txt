November 11, 2025
Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) today released a statement in honor of Veterans Day.
“For more than a century, we have set November 11
th
aside as a day to pause and express our gratitude to the Americans who have served in our nation’s armed forces. First as Armistice Day and now as Veterans Day, this day has come to celebrate the service of those who have defended our country in times of war and in times of peace. Today, we continue that honored tradition.
“We have a sacred obligation to serve our veterans as they served us. That means we need to invest in the health of our veterans, house our veterans, and provide educational and economic opportunities for our veterans. I look forward to continuing to work across the aisle to reach all those ideals. It’s the least we can do.
“To the tens of thousands of veterans in Delaware and the tens of millions across the nation – as well as the generations of veterans to come – thank you for your service. I am proud to be among your champions in the Senate and will always endeavor to honor your sacrifices on our behalf. Wishing you all a meaningful and blessed Veterans Day.”
