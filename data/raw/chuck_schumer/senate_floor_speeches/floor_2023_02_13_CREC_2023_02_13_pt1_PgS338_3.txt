The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so
ordered.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, now, for my remarks, first and
foremost, I begin today as happy as I could possibly be. Last week, my
daughter Alison and her wife celebrated the birth of little Henry--
their first child, my third grandchild.
The tie I am wearing today is the very same tie I wore on the day my
daughter and her wife got married. The last time I wore this same tie
on the floor of the Senate was the day the Respect for Marriage Act
passed the Senate. So it is not only a great tie, but it is a really
great day, and it symbolizes a whole lot.
I want to thank everyone for their messages of support. I am pleased
to report both moms and the baby are doing just great. He is such a
little cutie.
Few things put this job in perspective quite like being a
grandparent. I have often said that after my first grandkid Noah was
born--it was about 2 weeks later--I took a bike ride through the
wetlands near Coney Island. It is on the southern shore of Brooklyn.
The Atlantic Ocean laps up on it, and it is beautiful. I love that
ride, but 2 weeks after Noah was born, as I was riding, it hit me like
a bolt: Will Noah one day get to enjoy this beautiful, beautiful bike
path like I have? Because if the ocean rises even a few inches, this
bike path will be gone.
Having grandkids like that reminds you of what we are fighting for: a
better life for them, a better globe for them, a better world for them.
It is a motivation unlike any other.
Well, I could go on, but suffice it to say that today Chuck Schumer
is one happy grandparent, and I am grateful for everyone's kind words
over the past few days.
