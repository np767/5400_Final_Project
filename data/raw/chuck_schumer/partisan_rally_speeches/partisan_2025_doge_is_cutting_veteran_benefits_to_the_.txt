Doge is Cutting Veteran Benefits to the Bone
President Trump promised repeatedly on the campaign trail, “We got to take care of our veterans” and “I will put veterans first.” Yet his team at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has slashed the federal workforce, firing up to 6,000 veteran workers and decimating staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Over 2,400 VA staffers have been fired and DOGE announced plans to terminate 80,000 more. That’s
one in five staffers
that serve our nation’s heroes, getting them to appointments and helping them receive the benefits they’ve earned, all in the name of supposedly greater efficiency.
Make no mistake: this is a cut in benefits to our veterans and their families.
DOGE is cutting the VA to the bone and it’s our veterans who will suffer. The cuts impact critical health services for those injured in the line of service. The Veterans Health Administration serves over 9 million veterans annually in 1,380 VA health care facilities, making it the largest health care system in America. But that system is now on life support.
And it’s not just massive cuts to staff and programs that our servicemembers rely on. DOGE directed the VA to cancel over 800 contracts that support everything from chemotherapy treatment to records digitization.
How is any of this efficient?
