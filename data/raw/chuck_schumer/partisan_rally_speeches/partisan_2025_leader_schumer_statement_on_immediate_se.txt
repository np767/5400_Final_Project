Washington, D.C.
– Today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) released the following statement saying he will move for the Senate to quickly take up and pass the House passed bill releasing the Epstein files:
“Once the House passes the bill to release the Epstein files today, I will move for the Senate to immediately take it up and pass it — period.
