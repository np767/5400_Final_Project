Leader Schumer Statement On Trump “Plan” To Skyrocket Healthcare Costs
Washington, D.C.
– Today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) released the following statement on Trump’s “plan” to skyrocket healthcare costs for the American people:
“Donald Trump’s unhinged ramblings shows he still has no idea how anything actually works.
“His "plan" makes no sense.
“Sending people a few thousand dollars while doing nothing to lower healthcare costs is a scheme to help the ultra-wealthy at the expense of working people with cancer or pre-existing conditions.
“Americans want Congress to extend the ACA tax credits to keep health insurance premiums from skyrocketing on January 1.
“That's what Senate Democrats are fighting for.”
