 If you want to stop the liberal agenda of high taxes and high crime, you need to vote for Marsha Blackburn. Marsha, please come up, Marsha. Thank you all so very much for being here and for everything that you're doing to help elect Republicans this cycle. And thank you so much for all you did to send President Donald Trump and Mike Pence to the White House. They are doing... You were President and Vice President have had quite a 21 months and the Vice President said a few things about that and just think, record low unemployment, wages are growing. You are seeing so much done all across the globe. We're at the Iran deal. We've defeated... We've defeated ISIS in Syria, North Korea, China being held accountable and our U.S. Embassy is in Jerusalem, where it belongs. And to keep this working, I think Tennessee and so on, a U.S. Senator who is going to do exactly what she says she is going to do when she goes to Washington, DC. Now let me tell you, if my opponent Phil Bredison had his way, Hillary Clinton, who he gave $33,400 to, would be President and not any of these things would be happening. So, if you want to have somebody... All right, if you want to have somebody who's going to support more constitutional judges and is going to be there to support tax cuts, be there to build the wall. I ask you to... I ask you to stand with me and if you want to vote no, on Hillary Clinton and her cronies, one more time, stand with me. Let's win this election on Tuesday. Thank you. She's going to do a great job. Thank you very much. That was great. Thank you. Thank you, Marshall.
