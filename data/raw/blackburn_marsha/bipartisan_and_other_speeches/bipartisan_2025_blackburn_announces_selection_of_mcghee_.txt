BACKGROUND
The KC-46 Pegasus is the U.S. Air Force’s newest aerial refueling aircraft, designed to replace the KC-135 Stratotanker, which first entered service in 1957.
KC-46 Pegasus offers advanced boom and drogue refueling, secure communications, defensive systems, and support for cargo, passengers, and aeromedical evacuation. Its expanded range and modern systems enable the Air Force to meet mission demands in today’s complex global environment.
McGhee Tyson ANG Base boasts over 68 years of volunteer excellence and service to the Air Force. The unit has received a remarkable 16 Air Force Outstanding Unit awards and is one of the most decorated air refueling units in Air Force history.
Securing KC-46 Pegasus aircraft for McGhee Tyson ANG Base will preserve over 1,500 jobs and $203 million annually for decades to come.
