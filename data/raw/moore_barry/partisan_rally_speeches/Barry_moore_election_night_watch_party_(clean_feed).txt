Are you going to lie on the floor? Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. That's that. How about that, John? Okay. The little bity. It's wet. Get in here by eating fine, facing me. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're doing a live interview and 10 seconds. Okay. Mr. Moore, how are you feeling tonight? And how has the campaign been going? Well, the campaign, how am I feeling is incredible. I mean, the support we've had, you know, to be able to mount the kind of campaign we ran and ran the kind of race we've run. We just have the grassroots oil for us and to spend relatively a small dollar and to be blessed the way this campaign has been blessed. I'm just really humbled by the process and by the people they got behind us. I can't explain it, but I'm brave. Okay. Okay. How are the numbers going for you and how are you feeling tonight? I heard the first part of the question. The numbers are going really well. The precincts we're getting in, we've heard really, really well in our home area, well in the river region and even in Houston County we're doing well. So that's, I think, is key for us, picking up those Elmore, Talbot County, Northern District, Montgomery area, and then of course doing well in home. And so far, that's what we're here. So we're really, really blessed and we're excited about what we're here. How hard has your campaign team worked? Well, you know, we didn't really have a lot of paid staffers. You're looking at a campaign that didn't have a general manager. We didn't have a fundraiser. We just had grassroots and a couple of campaign staffers and people that love this and support this and a great social media team. And so, you know, they've worked so very hard and it's a roller coaster, but we learned over the years that it's never as good as you think it is. It's never as bad as you think it is. It's a roller coaster ride, but you just got to trust and walk in faith and that's what we've got. Have you talked to anyone today that's talked about how the voter turnout looked? How the voter turnout looked? You know, I don't, I haven't heard a lot in the areas. I've heard it's been low. So, I assume, you know, I think the Secretary of State said maybe 17%, but we really haven't had. No Pike County was a little low or a while ago. I was shocked by that number, but the rest of the air really haven't heard. I think everybody's just running about 17%. That's a guess. I don't know for sure. What are your next steps if you win? Well, you know, I guess the next step is trying to figure out, you know, how do we get ready to go? And for going into November, prepping our team for that, maybe bringing a few more people on to help us get our message out. And you know, walking faith, that's a lot of what we do. And so, I hadn't thought that far ahead, honestly. Thank you for your time, Mr. Moore. Sure. Morning. Okay, so you just want me to do it right there. I didn't come on. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You I'm standing here and I'm in a total shock. I'm in for a second. I see all that I'm not, but I'm a surprise as y'all. In the year, when he was an artist, I just had a work with him. I can't say that. I've got a little parents meet, I got a lot of people on the other side. I'm on the bed, I'm on the bottom wall, I'm in the car waiting for a lot. It's really been in here. But it will not have how I pray this whole total is praying. You can call the praise of Lord, and we do this because it's an asking. So I am doing again, you know, giving us what I'm about to do. All right, congratulations, very much. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. I was just kidding. And this work, we're going to have a kind of a difficult A.M. and a Pax. You got to let that warm. You got to shout, real loud, put your hands together. And you have to hear me. We're about to raise a hand for the baby. Oh, God, we love you. We thank you Lord, it's your name, this family to do this work at this time. We God that you've been with them and you've directed them. And you've placed your faith on their life Lord. And tonight we give you our God, all body and all the praise and all the glory. And we declare it to them in Jesus name, the strong son of God. And everybody said amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I don't want to try long time, I don't want to miss. I don't want to get off of it. I've got a flash for the two of you. Well, you know, it goes two ways. Sessions, you don't crack on that person, you crack on that person, you crack on that. And then it goes, you double so we trough turn it around and endorse it. So I want to give you a hand. You know what I mean? One is key for my son. One is key for my son. One is key for my son. One is key for my son. I don't think I'm going to give them the keys to life. Sessions, you got to get the keys. I don't want to give them the keys to life. I don't want to take them. I don't want to take them. I don't want to take them. I don't want to take them. I don't want to take them. I don't want to take them. I don't want to take them. I don't want to take them. I don't want to take them. Listen, say it. Listen, say it. Listen, say it. Listen, say it.

We got a time when we needed to get started. Not yet, the boss man said not yet. I don't know what to do. I have to stand up here for two or three minutes. Let me tell, can I, hey, Jonathan, can I tell the backstory? Not yet. We got to wait eight minutes. This is my boss right here, y'all. It's Jonathan Barbie. This guy we met on the floor of the Republican National Convention and Cleveland O'Hau. He was my alternate delegate. But more than that, we've called this a David and Goliath story. That is my Jonathan. He was my armor bearer. He and his wife, when I tell you they carried the media load for this, this guy didn't charge me hardly anything for what it was worth. It was how we were able to do it. Because he didn't matter on social media. It didn't matter if he had to drive through the night with a van to do a live event. He did it. He's my Jonathan. And so the Lord brought Jonathan in my life at the National Convention at what night's the dental at that time. And for us to be standing here tonight, Jonathan, that's unbelievable, brother. Unbelievable. And so he stays behind the scenes. You rarely ever see him. But I tell you, y'all, he was kind of like a campaign general manager. Am I supposed to call you now? Consultant. Consultant, whatever. He was a jack of all trades in a master. No, that's what Jonathan was. But he was great. And so he and I became fast friends. His wife, actually, during the primary, was walking around the building praying the whole time. Joe, come on up here. Joe, come on up here. So they have become, when you end the churches and you fight and those fights, those battles that those friends become family and they have become family really for us. So anyway, Jonathan, tell me when I can start. All right. All right. Let's go to five minutes. We have five minutes. Oh, we got five whole minutes. So. Any good enough? No questions? Yeah, no questions. No questions. No questions. Uh, yes. I hope everybody voted today. I hope everybody voted today. But anyway, so yeah, it's been an interesting road to hope for us. And so I got to say enough about my family and my friends and, like I said, the team. And we'll talk about those guys a little bit. Randy Higman on the end. And George Trotter. Those two guys. One on 13,000 miles on one of my trucks driving it around. So. Come on up, Fritz. Joey, y'all come on up, man. I also want to fill in up there. We saw it. Y'all come on up. Everybody come on around. Don't worry about the cameras that get what they need. Y'all don't need to be behind the cameras. Y'all need to be happy. Feeling on the side, Joey. Yeah, come on, man. Y'all come on up, brunts. Y'all come on up. Y'all come on up. Everybody come on around. Don't worry about the cameras that get what they need. Y'all don't need to be behind the cameras. Y'all need to be happy. Feeling on the side, Joey. Yeah, come on, man. Y'all come on up, brunts. Y'all come on up. Y'all come on up. Y'all come on up. Y'all come on up. Y'all come on up. Look at Mr. Cove. Woo! Woo! Woo! You're right over there, right over there, right here. I'm going back over there. You're right. You're right over there. Just me. Just me. You're right over there. I'm going back over there. Yeah. Come on. Woo! What doa mani, your heart? Everybody ready? Here we go! MANOr optimism Well And you know, guys, thank y'all so much for being here. It is a blessing to have you on my team and have the support and prayers that we've received. I've got to thank Ketchum's restaurant tonight. Were they not incredible, Daniel? Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Okay, so first thing I'm going to do is read a couple Bible verses. And these were kind of the ones that the Lord just gave us through the fire and over the last 770 days since the last primary. So first Jesus said, look at them and he said, with men it is impossible, but not with God. With God, all things are possible. And that's a Mark 1027. And Psalm 37, which has kind of been, it's the verse the Lord gave me through the most difficult time in my life. But that 2014, if that had not happened, I would not be standing here in front of you today. The Lord just, he'll cut you off to the root sometime and let you build from the ground up. And that's kind of what he did with our family and that's what he did with me and my walk in faith. And so this was a walk in faith. It made no sense to man. But you know, the obedience is counted. It's counted as righteousness. It's greater than, you know, obedience is the greatest thing you do. It's greater than any sacrifice you make. So we always try to walk in obedience. And this was a prayerful campaign. It was a grassroots campaign and God has blessed us. So the second one is Psalm 37, 5, 6. And some of y'all may have heard me read this before. If you watch much network TV, you probably did. It says, commit your way to the Lord. Trust him. And he will do this. He will make your righteousness reward shine like the dawn. Your vindication like the new day sign. And so this to us was about, we just wanted to run a clean race, you know, we wanted to give God the glory. And that's the first thing I wanted to do tonight. That's what we were instructed to do. And at end of the day, I'll tell y'all this, there's a God and we're not him. You know, we're not him. And he could do amazing things. I wrote in my journal a few months ago, it said, an improbability is a possibility. If you don't let your capabilities get in the way of God's availability. And that was a word the Lord gave me. In other words, these impossibilities are always possible if you don't ever limit God. And that's how I approached this. And so he has worked a miracle. This was truly a David and Gly. This was a David and Gly. We were outspent, I don't know. We spent maybe three or four hundred thousand on our race and they spent two or three million. But like I said, improbabilities are possibilities when God's involved. And so I want to thank a few people. I've got to certainly think my wife, Heather. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Chathleen, this is my daughter. Youngest Trump delegate in the nation, by the way. Claudia. Woo! Woo! Jeb, he's a caboose. And Jeremy. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! My mom and my dad, my mom is a, she's a prayer warrior. She's behind me here somewhere, I'm sure. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! My mother-in-law, I tell y'all when she prayed over me, she lives with us and she prayed over me often. And I felt those prayers. I mean, sometimes she would actually come down the morning when I was doing my Bible study and pray over me. And so that gives you a certain amount of comfort when you're going into battle, you know, that you're covered. And you're covered in the blood. And so we've had just so much support and prayers. And so of course, Sherry McCormick, about the only true page. Sherry was a super hard worker, you know, super hard worker. And about the only full-time paid staffer I had the whole time. She was just grassroots. You know, we've always believed that you, if you campaign among the people, you will govern for the people. But as you campaign from an ivory tower, you will govern from an ivory tower. And so Sherry was good at getting out and meeting people. And meeting needs, you know, when we got shut down with the COVID-19, we served people. We helped people. And so she's been big in that. Randy Hickman, I mentioned earlier, Mr. George Trotter. No body. These guys, I don't know where they find their energy, but these guys bring it. When I tell you they bring it, Mr. George would be calling you yelling on the phone about he got you two votes today. And Randy was just, Randy was up there wearing a wheels off of that truck. He peeped 13,000 miles. He drove that truck. And so just with a very more sign in the back of it, you know. And so just down the line, Shagler pride, Shagza. Yeah. Woohoo! Woohoo! Oh, Marine. Oh, Marine. My treasure. Steve Cape, Henrietta. Mr. Lewis Coles. Where's Mr. Lewis Coles? Right here. Yeah. Woohoo! That man right there drove me when we were working really, really hard for endorsements. We drove many a night. So I think we did 15 counties and meetings. And he drove me. And just drove me. And encouraged me. We had some good nights and some bad nights. His jokes get old after a while. He'll tell you the same story over and over. Andy Carver. Yeah. Johnny McCoy, Frank Wilts. Those are veterans. Those are the guys that worked so hard for the veterans in northern part of the district. Scott and Don Johnson. Miss Sue Newwine. I don't know if she's left yet or if she's still here. Miss Sue Newwine. Applause. It's Sue's fault that I stand before you today. She got me in the politics in 2008. She asked me to consider serving. And I went to the state house at that time. So it was her fault. John O'Roberts, Carol Bolston, Miss Virginia Howard's a prayer warrior friend of mine. God, they're all wonderful. Shannon Smith and her family, those kids, and they have worked so hard. I think they were waving signs today for us. So Mr. Jim Coles and then Andy Gamble. And Andy Gamble, Mickey Beverly Jordan. Tyler Burns. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler was kind of, he was a Johnny come lately. I mean, we hired him. He had worked hard on it. I guess a couple of races and y'all were in good shape. And so he reached out to us. And he worked at northern part of the river region. You see how sunburn he is? That's from walking door to door and waving signs and 100 degree day in and day out. And Emily helped him a lot. They did a wonderful job. My brother, Novi Bracken, y'all don't hurt him. Prayers, he here tonight. Novi don't like any kind of tension, but he's called to the Lord of what he does. And he just helped God us. When I tell y'all we ran a perfect campaign, we ran a perfect campaign. But it wasn't anything we did. It was the Lord's God us through Novi Bracken and Prayers. And he would give me words about not to go negative. He would tell me how to approach it. And so that's Novi was the God. He was my prayer warrior, my buddy. And he gave me peace at times when I didn't always have it. So anyway, so Novi, Randy Hard is not here, but Randy's a good friend of mine. He's a prayer warrior. And I'm sure we'll see him eventually around, but dear friend of mine, Bill Harris. Bill here is the other. He had to go back north. Bill's a good conservative guy from the northern part of the district. And he was my, I guess you say Joshua. He's the one that got me to step into 2018 and run. He said, he said, Barry, you know the Lord didn't park the water till the priest put the feet in the water? That was Bill Harris. And so we ran, I told Heather that day I said we're going to step in this congressional race and run against an incumbent. But we felt called to do that. Have we not laid the groundwork in 18? We would not be standing here in 2020. So the Lord, he'll build you that way. He'll start you in 14. He brought us through 18. And then he called us into this thing again. In 20, we're like, Lord, really? But you know, he's been faithful. And I, when I see a garbage man from Baton's Crossroad, Alabama, going to Congress and standing up here talking to a bunch of people and TV cameras, that tells you that we're living one of the greatest nations in the world. And we're going to be here. Man. There we are. We were against seven candidates in the primary. Seven people. Y'all know how discouraged and that can be. Especially when one of them's got $2 million. That can be discouraging. But you know, it was just we stepped in and we ran and we worked hard and here we are. And so I tell you, we're still the greatest nation on earth, but things like that. Tiffany Tata, one of my pair of warrior friends, and then Jason Howles, a prayer friend of mine. He's down the panel of Florida, but I met him a long time ago. He's a spirit-filled man. OK, my media warriors, they worked so hard. Y'all, we knew that grassroots was key. We knew that's how we would get the load out. And so that's what we did. They worked so hard. So I want to thank them. And Wendy and John, Sexton, Monica Howard, and Sean, Wendy Penson, Dorothy Robbins, volunteer over in the Do thing area. All my employees at BMI, they kind of held the fort down. All I did is. Yeah. APPLAUSE Warren Byron, his wife and his family have always supported and safe come to everything. And of course, Paul Daz, he's worked so hard. So Paul's kind of one of my guys. He shows up and he'll go door-knock, do whatever you ask him. Do he'll ride with me and drive me? And that helps a lot too. So anyway, I just want to thank y'all so much. And tell you this, Jonathan Brother, I love you. You've been my armor bearer through this thing, man. And so he has been a, I tell you, nobody has worked any harder than him to help us match the big money. And we did it without the big money, because of his hard work, him and his wife, and so. Guys, I appreciate y'all being here. And I can't tell you, it hadn't hit me yet, and we did this. And honestly, as much as you like to trust the Lord, sometimes you still go, Lord, are you sure about this? You know what you're going to say? But he has been so faithful and he's been so gracious. And so thank y'all, I love y'all. I love our community. And the president needs a little help. I've been with him since the day one, and I tell you this. Y'all keep me in your prayers, because I told the kids early on, I said, the winning this race and running this campaign, that's the easy part. Going to DC and facing the kind of stuff that we've got going on in this country, it's a spiritual battle for the future of the nation. I just tell you all that. It's not Democrats, it's not race wars. It's a spiritual battle for the future of our country. We've got to have men who are willing to bend the knee and look to heaven. And it's stand up and fight. And so that's what we're going to do. And so y'all keep us in your prayers. And God bless you. We love you guys. And I don't know what else to say except, I love you and I appreciate it. I'm serious. I'm serious. I'm serious that I didn't need to get a shout out to my veterans. The veterans really got out and worked so hard for us. They're soldiers anyway, but they were great foot soldiers. And so me being a veteran, me and only veteran in the race, that's been tremendous support for me all over the district. And so thank you guys. God bless you and y'all have a good night. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's get a picture with the roof. Yeah. Happy family Christmas. All right. Look. My mother. are ready. Go. You guys say it land. He said. We are ready.

I was going to go to the mic, the whole podium is closed for me. I was going to go to the mic, the whole podium is closed for me. Last day, we said we'll figure that out when we get there. Unless I want me just to go back. You know what I mean, right? I'm gonna do this thing. Oh, I'm telling you, I'm gonna go out there. I'm sure not all the women there. Oh, no. We got a new job.
