 Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thanks, guys. It was my first day of law school, my very first class. The goal is to escape, unscathed. Not three seconds in and I get the first question. Mr. Kennedy, what is the definition of a Sumpsit? Mr. Kennedy, you realize a Sumpsit is the very first word in your reading. Yeah, I'm actually circled it because I didn't know what it meant. Mr. Kennedy, do you want a dictionary? That's what people do when they don't know what a word means. They look it up in a dictionary. I never showed up unprepared for Professor Elizabeth Warren ever again. She was the toughest teacher on campus, but the weight list for her class was a mile long. She pushed us hard, she brought out our best, she believed in us, and she believed in the law, not as an abstraction, but as a living force with the power to make life better or worse. She taught us that it's impacts late, not in classrooms or textbooks, but in a society where wages have not budged in 40 years. We're two and a half million children are homeless, where we can expect one and three black men to go to prison. Our laws have human consequences. That fact fueled law school professor to take on this country's most entrenched financial interest. She brought a middle class champion back to a Massachusetts Senate seat, and it led a first term US Senator to become our government's gut check. In a sea of power and privilege, Senator Warren is an anchor for the voiceless and victimized. She asks more from all of us because she believes deeply in each of us. That faith in our country and the American people is the very foundation of our Democratic Party. It echoes through this arena tonight, and through every classroom, living room, and hearing room that Senator Elizabeth Warren has ever touched. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to introduce to you your Senator, my Senator, our Senator, Elizabeth Warren.
