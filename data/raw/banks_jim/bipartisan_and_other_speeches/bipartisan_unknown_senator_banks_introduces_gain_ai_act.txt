Senator Banks Introduces GAIN AI Act
WASHINGTON, D.C,
– Today, Senator Jim Banks (R-Ind.) introduced the
GAIN AI Act.
This legislation creates an America-First right of first refusal to ensure American customers are served by our cutting-edge technology before foreign adversaries. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) are original cosponsors of the bill.
Senator Jim Banks: (R-Ind.):
“The GAIN AI Act makes sure we use American-made technology to strengthen our own economy and security before sending it to adversaries overseas.”
Key Provisions of the
GAIN AI Act
are:
Prevent the
export of advanced
artificial intelligence chips to arms embargoed countries if there is unmet demand from American companies.
Strengthen
national security and technological competitiveness
by ensuring U.S. companies have a “right of first refusal” to acquire these chips.
Promotes U.S. technology dominance by allowing trusted American companies (such as large cloud service providers and chip operators) to
move or operate advanced AI chips abroad
without triggering full export control licensing
, as long as they meet stringent security and ownership criteria.
Full text of the bill can be found
here.
