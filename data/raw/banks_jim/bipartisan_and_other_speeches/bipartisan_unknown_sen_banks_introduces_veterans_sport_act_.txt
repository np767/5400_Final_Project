Sen. Banks Introduces Veterans SPORT Act to Expand VA Coverage for Recreational Prosthetics
WASHINGTON, D.C,
– Last week, Senator Jim Banks (R-Ind.) introduced the
Veterans SPORT Act.
This legislation would expand the VA medical benefits package to fully cover recreational prosthetics on a permanent basis. Senator Angus King (I-Maine.) is an original cosponsor of this bill.
Senator Jim Banks: (R-Ind.):
“Our disabled veterans made tremendous sacrifices in defense of our nation, and they shouldn’t have to navigate VA red tape to get the medical equipment they need to lead active lifestyles. The Veterans SPORT Act would make sure their prosthetics are always covered.”
The bill is endorsed by the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), Wounded Warrior Project,
Orthotic and Prosthetic Group of America, and National Association for the Advancement of Orthotics and Prosthetics.
Key Provisions of the
Veterans
SPORT
Act
are:
Add recreational prosthetics to the VA medical benefit package, ensuring they are always fully covered.

Background:
Veterans who play sports and exercise regularly report higher self-esteem, lower levels of depression and anxiety, and reduced stress. Physical activity is associated with reduced symptoms of PTSD. However, veterans with physical disabilities may need activity-specific prostheses and custom orthoses to participate in sports, and these devices are expensive. Current law restricts the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from providing recreational prosthetics unless they are considered a “direct and active component” of medical treatment. As a result, prosthetics that support exercise beyond a prescribed rehabilitation plan are typically not covered.
