 I'm here because the next president of the United States invited me. I was a little scared at first. I wondered if Hillary really knew who I was. Not just the work I do in entertainment, but who I really am. Who is Lee Daniels? Does she know that my sister's under house arrest? Does she know that my brother's main art is in jail? Does she know that my nephew is in jail? That my cousins are in and out of jail? My father was a police officer, shot and murdered right here in Philadelphia when I was 15. Does she even know that I've been to jail? That's the America I know. And still I rise. And hit me like a brick. Hillary knows me. She knows me. And that's what gave me the courage to come and speak in front of y'all tonight. Hillary has stood with families of people who died due to gun violence. These helped turn their heartache into action. I wish she was around for me when my dad died. Hillary understands our right to bear guns, but wants to stop guns from getting into the wrong hands. You guys, 33,000 Americans die each year from gun violence. That's 90 people a day. Enough. We need to take action. And we need to take action now. There's only one candidate willing to take on gun violence. There's only one candidate willing to take on the gun lobby and keep our families safe. I'm bad at this teleprompter stuff. And for that millennial who comes from where I come from, who doesn't think that you have a voice, you do, and there ain't no choice. This is the most important election of our lifetime. Come November. Vote for her. May God bless you, Hillary Clinton, and God bless America.
