ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST SECRETARY MAYORKAS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. Rose) for 5 minutes.
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, after nearly a year-long and thorough
investigation by the House Committee on Homeland Security, House
Republicans have released Articles of Impeachment against Department of
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his willful and
systemic refusal to comply with the law and breach of the public trust.
As many of my fellow Tennesseans know, for quite some time now I have
fully supported the House's efforts to examine whether Secretary
Mayorkas has committed an impeachable offense. Now, after an
investigation into the causes, costs, and consequences of Secretary
Mayorkas' actions that have exacerbated this historic humanitarian
crisis at our southern border, the time has come to officially release
Articles of Impeachment.
According to the House Committee on Homeland Security, DHS Secretary
Mayorkas is ``chiefly responsible for the chaos and devastation that
has unfolded over the past 3 years'' at America's borders and ports of
entry.
The committee has found that Secretary Mayorkas violated his oath to
support and defend the Constitution of the United States by willfully
and systemically refusing to comply with Federal immigration laws. He
has also acted in a manner subversive of the law.
These subversive actions and willful negligence of our country's laws
have led to an unprecedented level of illegal immigration at our
southern border and ports of entry, a fentanyl crisis killing thousands
of Tennesseans, and skyrocketing financial costs on the U.S. taxpayers.
That is why the first Article of Impeachment being released is
titled, ``Willful and Systemic Refusal to Comply with the Law.''
The second Article of Impeachment being released is titled, ``Breach
of Public Trust.'' As a Cabinet official and someone in the line of
succession to the Presidency, the American people must trust Secretary
Mayorkas to say and do the right thing. Unfortunately, he has done
exactly the opposite. He has knowingly made false statements about his
refusal to comply with the law and the impact his decisions have had.

He has even obstructed the committee's work to save the American
people from this catastrophe.
We must take all national security threats seriously and after a
thorough, fair, and comprehensive investigation into Secretary
Mayorkas, remaining in his position is a threat to our national
security.
Not only has he willfully ignored his constitutional duty to defend
our country and breached the public trust, but he has also demonstrated
an unwillingness to change course or correct his mistakes. One could
only presume that he would continue to be a threat to the health of our
Nation, its security, and our Constitution.
Americans deserve better than what they are getting. Every town in
America doesn't have to be a border town. We must exercise our
constitutional duty and hold Secretary Mayorkas accountable to our best
abilities. It is, therefore, my sad but straightforward duty to vote
for his impeachment and support his removal from office.
