REPUBLICAN ECONOMIC SCHEME HURTS WORKING FAMILIES
(Ms. BROWN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the extremists in this
Chamber to stop playing political chess with the lives of working
people and families.
In 2021, 85 percent of Americans over the age of 50 opposed cuts to
Social Security and Medicare to reduce the national debt.
Clearly, the economic scheme proposed by the GOP is in direct
opposition to the people's will: slashing Social Security and Medicare
for the working class while giving tax breaks to the wealthy.
The GOP scheme also proposes a ridiculous 30 percent--yes, 30
percent--national sales tax, a huge setback for working families,
increasing the cost of everyday essentials and raising gas prices.
As if that wasn't enough, this scheme is holding the reputation of
our Nation hostage to extremist demands for cuts to Social Security and
Medicare.
Democrats stand with the people. Dismantling Medicare and Social
Security will never be up for debate.
