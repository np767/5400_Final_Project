WOMEN'S ACCESS TO MEDICATION ABORTION
(Ms. ROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend women's access to
medication abortion.
In the wake of the Dobbs decision, the Justice Department reaffirmed
that States cannot ban the abortion pill, which now accounts for the
majority of abortions nationwide.
Medication abortion is safe and effective. It is healthcare.
However, in North Carolina, women face unnecessary limitations that
not only allow treatment to be delayed by 72 hours but require
counseling before medication abortion.
This week, a brave physician in North Carolina, Amy Bryant, filed a
lawsuit challenging these dangerous restrictions.
Let's be clear. Any State that limits a physician's ability to
prescribe abortion medication is causing harm to women and creating
needless barriers to healthcare.
We cannot give up on the fight for full reproductive autonomy.
