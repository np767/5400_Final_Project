IT IS TIME TO GET BACK TO WORK
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to express my support for H.R.
139, the SHOW UP Act, which was introduced by my good friend from
Kentucky, the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and
Accountability, Mr. Comer, and passed on this floor yesterday.
Millions of Tennesseans show up to work every day. However, more than
half of Federal Government workers, who are expected to serve the
American people, still aren't showing up for work. This has led to
extremely long wait times and delays in services.
Veterans who showed up to work and served our country can't get their
proper VA benefits. Families are waiting months for their passports. In
my district, a father waited for more than 8 months to receive his tax
return. The entire time, he was left in the dark by the IRS.
Tennesseans deserve better, Mr. Speaker. The pandemic is over, and it
is time to get back to work.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support like-minded measures.
