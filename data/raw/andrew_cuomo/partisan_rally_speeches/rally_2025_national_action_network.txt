Government was about doing things for people—making change. Touch my life. Do something that affects me. That's what government is. And we lost that connection. And that's what we have to regain.

Governor Cuomo, candidate for Mayor of New York City, delivered remarks at the National Action Network in Harlem this morning, joined by Reverend Al Sharpton, Congressman Greg Meeks, Assemblymember Jordan Wright, and Assemblymember Latrice Walker. Cuomo emphasized the urgent threat posed by Donald Trump and called for Democratic unity and self-reflection ahead of the mayoral primary. He urged the party to reconnect with everyday concerns and challenged government at all levels to deliver real, equitable economic opportunities for all New Yorkers.
Reverend Al Sharpton praised Governor Cuomo’s strong leadership and vision, highlighting their decades-long friendship and mentorship. Sharpton commended Cuomo’s clear focus on tangible goals and commitment to justice, and emphasized the importance of turning out to vote in this election—especially among Black, Latino, and marginalized communities—reminding the audience of the sacrifices made by civil rights heroes to secure that right. He urged voters to choose leaders who will stand up for their interests and warned that the stakes are too high for apathy.
A transcript of remarks is below:
Governor Cuomo:
Thank you. Thank you. It is a pleasure to be back at the House of Justice once again with the great Reverend Al Sharpton, who is a force for justice unparalleled in this country. A friend of mine for 40 years, he's been like an older brother to me. Reverend, you know— [Sharpton: two years, two years] —details. Details. He has been like an older brother and like a mentor to me. And I watch him, and I observe him, and he turns around to me, the younger brother, and gives me his guidance. And I can't thank him enough. But God bless him, 'cause he has been a great force for justice when we need it.
Reverend Al Sharpton. Congressman Greg Meeks, my homeboy from Queens. I worked with him in Albany. I worked with him in Washington. This is a man, a force for change. And that's what we need. Congressman Greg Meeks. Assemblywoman Latrice Walker. Assemblyman Jordan Wright. Thank you so much for doing what you do in Albany.
Let me make a couple of quick points, if I can, before the Reverend gets out the big hook.
Number one, on President Trump. He is an existential threat to this nation. He is worse than he was in his first term. I worked with him in the first term. I know his moves from the first term. He is more adamant, more dangerous this term. It has gone to his head. It has gone to his head—“commander in chief.” I'm the “commander in chief.” I command the military. I'm gonna have a parade. I'm gonna call out the tanks. I'm gonna call out the troops. This is all in his head. This is all an exercise in narcissism. “Get me a big gun, get me a big gun. I need a big gun.”
Yeah, you need a big gun, but you're not gonna get it from the Army. He, in 2020, sent troops to cities all across the country—Cleveland, Detroit, Albuquerque, Indianapolis. He sent troops all across the country. You know where he didn't send troops? New York City. New York City. Why? Because he is smart enough not to pick a fight that he can't win. And he cannot pick a fight in New York with me and you and win. And he's not sending any troops to New York City. Period.
Number two, it's a Democratic primary. What a Democratic primary means is it's time to look in the mirror, and it's a time to reflect on us. This is not about the Republicans, it's not about the enemies—it's about us. Who are we? What are we doing right? What are we doing wrong? How do we improve? It's about us—a Democratic primary. And the truth is, when I look in the mirror at the Democratic primary, I don't believe that Donald Trump won. I don't believe anybody went out and won for Donald Trump. I believe the Democrats lost. I believe people weren't enthused enough to come out and vote for the Democrats. Why? Because we had lost connection with our people. We weren't at the kitchen table with our people. We're talking about all sorts of things. They're worried about their mortgage. They're worried about their rent. They're worried about their public safety. They're worried about their education. But we are not talking to them. They're wondering, how do I get ahead? How do I make it? Where's my path in America? And we're not talking to them.
And government was not supposed to be an abstract art. You know, government was not about this. It was not about talking, right? Some people are about this.
Government was not about that. Government was about doing things for people—making change. Touch my life. Do something that affects me. That's what government is. And we lost that connection. And that's what we have to regain. And that's what we have to regain.
Now, people have to know I'm a Democrat because they fight the fight for me, and they're gonna make a difference in my life. Now, one great effective way to do it is this—people need opportunities to advance themselves economically. That's what the Democratic Party's always been about. How do I move ahead? How do I get ahead? How do I accumulate wealth? How do I improve myself?
The government of New York State provides about $250 billion in work every year in the budget. $250 billion. So the question becomes, of the $250 billion, how much money was going to minority businesses and women-owned businesses and Hispanic businesses? What were you doing with the $250 billion? And when I became governor, it turned out that only 10% of that money was going to what they call MWBE companies. Ten percent. And I said, how is that fair? So we took the 10%, and I said, I want to raise it to 30%. They said, it's impossible. It's the highest in the nation. We could never do it. And you know what? We did it. And billions of dollars of wealth flowed through to minority businesses all across the state.
New York City—it's gonna be the same thing. New York City has a $115 billion budget. What percent now goes to Black contractors and companies? One and a half percent. What percent goes to Latino companies? One percent. One percent. How do you justify that? How do you justify it? I'm gonna take that—we're gonna raise it not to 30%, which is what I did in the state—35%, the highest rate in the United States of America. You wanna talk about DEI and inclusion? We're gonna show you inclusion. We're gonna set the highest rate in the United States to include minority businesses here in New York City. Number one.
Number two, the old expression—follow the money. Where is the money in this nation? Trillions of dollars locked up in pension funds. Public pension funds, private pension funds, but trillions of dollars. And we have trillions of dollars in public pension funds in New York City, New York State. And we invest those pension funds. Alright, well, who do you invest those pension funds with? Remember, those pension funds come from the workers. Sixty percent of the workers in New York City—Black, Brown, and women. Sixty percent of the workers. So it's their money. It's their pension money. They're putting it in—60%. Who are you giving that money to?
Well, to minority contractors and women contractors—those pension funds—11% get invested with MWBE companies. Eleven percent of the pension funds. How is that fair? Sixty percent of the workers who are putting in the money—then you go to invest the money and only 11% goes to MWBE companies? Thirteen percent now, recently—top number. Meanwhile, Philadelphia—57% goes to MWBE contractors. Chicago does over 50% to MWBE contractors. And New York City can't figure out how to do it?
New York City is supposed to lead the way for the nation. We're supposed to show social and racial economic justice. We are gonna take that money—that pension fund money—35% has to go to minority and women business enterprises. We are then gonna take that money, we're gonna invest it in our communities, in our city. We're gonna build housing. We're gonna create economic opportunity. We're gonna partner with faith-based organizations. We are gonna bring in the unions and say, we want you to give apprenticeships to those young kids who are struggling and can't find a job. And you're gonna give them a trade at 18 and 24 years old. And we're going to rebuild this city—not back to what it was. We're gonna build this city better than it has ever been before. We can. We will. And we'll do it together. Don't tell me we can't do it, 'cause I know we can.
Greg is exactly right. You wanna know what we can do? You go look at the new LaGuardia Airport and tell me what we can do. You go look at the new JFK. You go look at the new Second Avenue Subway, the new Moynihan Train Hall, the new Mario Cuomo Bridge. You go look at our possibility. And you ain't seen nothing yet.
Thank you, and God bless you.
Reverend Al Sharpton:
Now let me, let me just say that the substance of what he said, that's what I want to hear of. What are the goals you're going to do? Now, I don't need nobody to help me say no justice, no peace. I know how to say that. I need somebody to say we going from 1 or 2% to 33%. That's what we want to hear from all the candidates. Tell us what you're going to do. So I know how to judge you and rate you. So he made a good presentation. Like he said, I taught him well, even though I'm only three years older than him. I started him in daycare center.
Let me say, in the few moments we have left, tomorrow—Father's Day—every father needs to make sure they come out and vote. Particularly in New York. Don't you ever forget—nothing enrages me more, Greg Meeks, than to hear some Blacks talking about, I don't know what to vote for. First of all, my mother was born and raised in Dothan, Alabama. She could not vote until her forties if she went back there. She moved to New York, had me and my sister—we New Yorkers. They had to fight to get the right to vote. People died to get us the right to vote. Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner—two Jews and a Black—died. Italian woman out of Detroit, Michigan, Viola Liuzzo, died. They were killed fighting for voting rights. Voting.
And you going to tell me that some 50 years later in New York City, people died to give you a right and you sitting up acting like you in a restaurant with the menu? You looking for your dish? You better vote your interests. You better vote for your children. You better vote for a better way in this city. We are under siege. If anybody ought to vote, it's Black folks. It's Latino folks. It's LGBTQ folks. It's the left out and the left behind. We need to come out in big numbers. They are predicting a low turnout. What we need is to turn on everybody that is listening to me on radio.
First thing you should say: Morning. Have you voted yet? You ain't even gotta wait till Tuesday next. Have you voted yet? You might get sick—vote early. It might rain—vote early. But vote for who is on your side.
Press asking me, whose side are you on, Rev? I'm on who's on my side. I don't vote for whose side I'm on. I vote for who's on my side, who stand up and open doors for me. That'll make a way for me. That'll fight for me when it's not fashionable to fight. I don't need nobody that ain't going to stand up. I need some backbone. It is imperative, particularly in this administration.
Lemme tell you something. They going to pour a lot of money in this state next year. They gonna try to flip the governor. They're gonna try to flip the State Attorney General. We have an administration that is not bashful about the interests they want to serve. So we ain't got no time to be playing for popularity contests. This is about our future.
