WASHINGTON – Sen. Jon Husted (R-Ohio) today joined President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump at the White House for the signing of an Executive Order on strengthening foster care. The Executive Order will expand opportunities for education, career development, housing and other resources for young adults transitioning from foster care to adulthood.
This Executive Order is part of First Lady Melania Trump’s
Fostering the Future
initiative and will secure educational opportunities and scholarships for children in foster care.
“As a U.S. Senator who was once in foster care, I was honored that the president invited me to this special event at the White House today. I spent the first two months of my life in foster care before being adopted by my loving parents, and that experience shaped my belief that every child deserves a secure and loving home. Too many kids age out of foster care without the love and support they need, and today’s executive order sets us on a path to help kids through increased educational and employment opportunities. I’m grateful to President Trump and the First Lady for taking this issue head on,”
said Husted.
This visit builds on Husted’s support of foster youth. Husted joined a
resolution
to recognize May as National Foster Care Month, which passed the Senate in May.
