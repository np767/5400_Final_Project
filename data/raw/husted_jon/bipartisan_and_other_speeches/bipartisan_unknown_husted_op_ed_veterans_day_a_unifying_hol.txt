Husted op-ed: Veterans Day: A unifying holiday for America
November 11, 2025
“I hope all Ohioans will join me this Veterans Day, not just in thanking those who have served, but in hearing their stories and learning from their experiences.”
WASHINGTON – Sen. Jon Husted (R-Ohio) penned this
op-ed
in Ohio outlets to celebrate Veterans Day and honor the nearly 700,000 veterans in Ohio.
Key excerpts include:
“Each year, Veterans Day serves as a reminder for Americans to thank veterans for their service. We owe it to those who served to recognize their sacrifice all year long.”
. . .
“We only sacrifice for the things we love. And the sad reality is a
record-low
percentage of Americans, 58% to be exact, say they are ‘very’ or ‘extremely proud’ to be an American. A record-high percentage of Americans, 21%, are ‘only a little’ or ‘not proud at all’ of their country. As we approach the 250
th
birthday of our great nation, I hope my fellow Americans will join me in seeking a new birth of patriotism.”
. . .
“Everyone in the country can learn from America’s heroes about what it means to answer the call of duty. Veterans come from all walks of life, political beliefs and backgrounds, yet they are united in their service. There is no better example of what it means to unite around the cause of freedom than veterans and servicemembers.”
. . .
“Serving nearly
700,000 veterans
who call Ohio home in the U.S. Senate is an honor I do not take lightly. Throughout my time in public service, serving Ohio’s veterans includes recognizing their service and sharing their stories.”
. . .
“I hope all Ohioans will join me this Veterans Day, not just in thanking those who have served, but in hearing their stories and learning from their experiences. And when you do, I hope you will feel a renewed sense of American pride and patriotism.”
