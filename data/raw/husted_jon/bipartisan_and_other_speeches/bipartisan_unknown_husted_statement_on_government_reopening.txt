Husted’s remarks:
“After 43 days, it’s finally over. We got a vote to reopen the government. It was completely unnecessary that this happened.
“I voted 16 times to reopen the government before, finally, eight Democrats joined us, fighting back against Chuck Schumer and the radical left to say, ‘Enough is enough.’
“And so together, those moderate Democrats and all of us Republicans joined together to reopen government—to end the suffering the American people were facing.
“Traffic delays from flights, SNAP benefits, paychecks going unmet, families not able to make ends meet—all so unnecessary after a 43-day temper tantrum by the Democrats.
“But I’m proud that as Republicans, we pulled together. We are fighting for middle-class Ohioans and Americans. We’ve passed some of the most amazing tax reform plans in this country’s history.
“We cut taxes for middle-income earners, eliminating taxes on tips, eliminating taxes on overtime, cutting taxes on Social Security, child tax credits to help working families. So, we have an agenda to help people earn more, keep more of what they earn, and cut prices by reducing fuel prices, by trying to attack the wasteful, wasteful, wasteful Obamacare plan that’s driven up health care costs. And we know that millions and millions are being siphoned off in fraud.
“So, there’s still work to do. But today, we can finally claim victory over the radical left who shut down the government for 43 days. I’m happy that we got over this.
“And God bless America. Let’s keep the momentum going.”

Requires unspent funds from members of Congress’ personal office budgets to be used for debt and deficit reduction.
