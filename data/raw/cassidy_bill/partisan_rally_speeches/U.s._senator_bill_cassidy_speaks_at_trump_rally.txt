 But let me start by saying this. This is my second trip with the president to Southwest Louisiana in the last few months. That is not actually him. This president, this president, while he's been president, let Charles Cameron Southwest Louisiana, you will become an actual gas capital of the world. We produce it, we manufacture it, we ship it around the world, and while we do so, we may live better off, and we're better off too. Now, you can draw a straight line from President Trump saying he wanted the United States to be energy dominant to the jobs here in Southwest Louisiana. He has stood with us, so I'm going to ask you a series of questions. Kind of the tease out, we're going to stand with him. You might not have noticed, but he's up to reelection. His love in the opponent was the vice president, John Biden before he was president. Show some of us, show me how I'm going to ask you. I'm going to ask you to give me some answers to some questions. They're pretty tough, but I want to see if you can do it. Who stands by us to secure our border? Joe Biden or Donald Trump? Who stood by us to rebuild our military? Joe Biden or Donald Trump? Who are voices from several judges? Biden Trump! Who has pro-life values? Joe Biden, Donald? Who believes in the second amendment? Biden Trump! Who is right in the counter-eating with a record low unemployment? Biden Trump! Now, this is the toughest question. I think, I think, I think. Go back here to do the very top. Who do you want to be elected president in 2020? Who do you think wants a Republican governor of Louisiana? Biden or Biden? Who? I'm sorry. The president has stood by us, stand by us, vote tomorrow, thank you. President Trump would vote for. Thank you very much. President Trump!
