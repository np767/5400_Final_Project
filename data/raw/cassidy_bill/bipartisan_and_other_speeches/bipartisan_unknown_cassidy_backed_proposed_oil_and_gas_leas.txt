WASHINGTON
– U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) applauds the Trump Administration’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)
announcement
of the Proposed Notice of Sale for the second offshore oil and gas lease sale. Cassidy played a key role in getting this sale authorized through President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts bill.
“I’m working with President Trump to boost American energy, lower costs, and create jobs,”
said Dr. Cassidy.
“That starts right here in Louisiana’s backyard—the Gulf of America.”
The proposed lease sale is scheduled to take place on March 11, 2026. This sale is the second of
thirty Gulf of America oil and gas lease sales
required by the Working Families Tax Cuts bill. By committing to a predictable sale schedule, the department is delivering on President Trump’s promise to expand American energy production and strengthen U.S. energy dominance.
