WASHINGTON –
U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), released the following statements following U.S. Senate passage of their
resolution
condemning the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for the abduction of Pastor Ezra Jin and other leaders of the Zion Church and calling for their release.
“Faith isn’t a crime. We need to call out China for once more targeting people of faith,”
said Dr. Cassidy.
“Christians are fighting daily for their religious freedom against the Chinese Communist Party. Last month, the CCP carried out its largest nationwide crackdown in over four decades against a Christian house church in China. I’m grateful to Senator Coons and my colleagues for standing with me to demand Pastor Jin and his congregation’s release and to make clear that any government that fears faith is tyrannical,”
said Senator Cruz.
Cassidy and Cruz were joined by U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Tim Scott (R-SC), Chris Coons (D-DE), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Jim Justice (R-WV), and Rick Scott (R-FL) in introducing the resolution.
Background
On October 10, 2025, the CCP conducted the largest coordinated, nationwide crackdown against a Christian urban house church in over four decades. At least 22 pastors and church members from Zion Church, one of China’s largest underground congregations, were arrested, including a prominent pastor and the founder of Zion Church, Pastor “Ezra” Jin Mingri.
