WASHINGTON –
U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) announced that Louisiana has become the first state in the nation to receive full federal approval of its plan to deploy $1,355,554,552.94 billion in broadband internet funding from his
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
.
“I was proud to negotiate the infrastructure bill to secure this $1.36 BILLION in funding for Louisiana. Access to high-speed internet is essential for every small business owner, student, and worker. I am grateful to President Trump for his work to get it moving,”
said Dr. Cassidy.
While negotiating the infrastructure bill, Cassidy pushed for a fair broadband formula that would benefit Louisiana’s needs and ensure the funding was directed to areas that lacked access to high-speed internet. The formula is based on the number of unserved and underserved broadband recipients in each state as determined by updated Broadband internet-coverage maps.
