WASHINGTON
– U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) called on Congress to work together to address rising health care costs by sending money directly to Americans at a U.S. Senate Finance Committee hearing. Cassidy also criticized the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, which funnel billions of taxpayer dollars to giant insurance companies with no incentive to lower the cost of health premiums. Cassidy’s proposal would redirect that money to patients to help pay for care and out-of-pocket expenses.
President Trump
has spoken supportively of Cassidy’s concept.
“Under the status quo, the insurance companies get the money that subsidizes premiums, the insurance company makes the decision, and it doesn’t lower health care costs. In fact, it actually contributes to higher costs, and it fuels fraud and unauthorized enrollment.”
said Dr. Cassidy.
“Under what we’re proposing, is that 100% goes to a patient-driven account in which she can use for a physician, or dentist, or drugs,”
said Dr. Cassidy.
Cassidy has
continuously called
for Congress to work together on real solutions to lower health insurance costs for families.
