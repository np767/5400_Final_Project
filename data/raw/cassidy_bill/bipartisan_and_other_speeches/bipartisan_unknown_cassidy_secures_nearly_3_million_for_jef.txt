WASHINGTON
– U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) announced Jefferson Transit will receive $2,975,000.00 to upgrade bus stops throughout its service area to ensure compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act standards. Cassidy secured this funding through a combination of Congressionally Directed Spending and Cassidy’s
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
through the Federal Transit Administration.
“Jefferson Parish families rely on these routes to get to work, school, the grocery store, appointments, and more,”
said Dr. Cassidy.
“This project ensures the stops along the way are safer and more accessible.”
The project will modernize bus stop locations parish-wide to improve accessibility and enhance rider experience.
Since taking office, Cassidy has been one of the most effective U.S. Senators at directing federal dollars home to Louisiana, despite not serving on the Appropriations Committee. In FY2024,
Roll Call
reported Cassidy was one of the top 20 senators in total funding secured for his state—and one of only five in that group who does not sit on the committee. That year, he
secured
a record $1.3 billion for Louisiana, the highest of any member of the state’s congressional delegation.
