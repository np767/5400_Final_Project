WASHINGTON—
U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR), Co-Chair of the Senate Recycling Caucus, applauded Senate passage of the
Strategies to Eliminate Waste and Accelerate Recycling Development (STEWARD) Act
. The legislation passed the Senate unanimously and will next be considered by the U.S. House of Representatives.
“I am pleased to see the STEWARD Act pass the Senate with bipartisan support and move one step closer to becoming law,”
said Boozman
. “This legislation represents a strong commitment to enhancing and modernizing recycling access initiatives nationwide, which can particularly benefit underserved areas. I urge my colleagues in the House to approve this win-win for sustainability and economic development.”
In
February
, the
STEWARD Act
advanced out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The bill would improve our nation’s recycling and composting systems and establish a pilot recycling program at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to award grants on a competitive basis to communities interested in improving their recycling accessibility. A one-pager explanation of the bill is available
