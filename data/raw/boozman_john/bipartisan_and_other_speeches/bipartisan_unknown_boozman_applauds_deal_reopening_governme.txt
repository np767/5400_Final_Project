WASHINGTON—
U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) applauded Senate passage of legislation that reopens the federal government while fully funding several departments and agencies for Fiscal Year 2026 including the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Veterans Affairs (VA). Boozman, who serves as Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies (MilCon-VA), also welcomed advancement of the spending measure he authored that delivers important investments for veterans’ medical care and benefits as well as defense infrastructure projects.
“Taking basic government services hostage through a shutdown is costly and tremendously unfair to the American people. This record-breaking stalemate had real consequences for Arkansas families and communities, so I am thankful reason finally prevailed and we are restoring vital funding and benefits instead of prolonging such senseless, harmful chaos.
“I am also proud our bipartisan bill to fund the VA and military construction projects was part of the solution to this impasse. Providing funding that supports America’s veterans, our servicemembers currently serving and sacrificing, as well as their loved ones should always be a top priority. Congress must build on this progress and work together to advance the other full-year funding bills that will serve all Americans,”
Boozman said
.
The Boozman-authored MilCon-VA legislation supports the Arkansas National Guard and secures $93 million in funding for Red River Army Depot projects. The package also fully funds USDA for FY26 and includes the extension of farm programs and authorities not covered in the
One Big Beautiful Bill Act
that were set to expire at the end of the year, in addition to an extension of federal grain inspection activities.
Background
The federal government shutdown that began on October 1 became the longest full or partial shutdown in U.S. history. Boozman repeatedly
expressed his disappointment
with the partisan political tactics that caused it and voted 15 times to advance a clean, straightforward, nonpartisan bill to fund the federal government. His offices remained opened and supplied Arkansans with
information and resources
about the shutdown’s impact on federal programs and services.
The continuing resolution passed by the Senate will reopen the government and extend funding through January 30, 2026, in addition to providing back pay to all federal workers.
