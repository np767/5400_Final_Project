Senate Democrats Block Bill to Pay Troops and Federal Workers
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senate Democrats voted against the
Shutdown Fairness Act
today, blocking pay for federal employees who are required to work during government shutdowns. The bill, introduced by U.S. Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI), would have paid Coast Guard and active duty service members, air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents, federal contractors, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, federal law enforcement officers, and excepted employees in the legislative and judicial branches of U.S. government.
U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement after voting in favor of the
Shutdown Fairness Act
:
“Democrats are using the government shutdown to play political tug-of-war, but federal workers are not
leverage
, they’re
hostages
. We’re talking about law enforcement officers, service members, air traffic controllers, and many more. It’s time for Democrats to end their absurd obstruction and make sure essential workers can pay for housing and feed their families.”
