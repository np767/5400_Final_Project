Blacklisted Chinese companies can now exploit a loophole to obtain key U.S. technologies, threatening national security
Washington, D.C. –
U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) urged the Trump administration to reverse its decision to suspend critical export controls that prevent Chinese companies from accessing sensitive American technology.
The senators warned that Trump’s
move
, made as part of trade negotiations with Communist China, could allow blacklisted foreign companies to obtain advanced U.S. technologies, including cutting-edge AI chips, and weakens the authority of the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to safeguard national security.
“By suspending these export controls, the Trump administration is opening the door for blacklisted Chinese companies to access some of our most sensitive technologies,”
said Senator Cortez Masto.
“This isn’t tough negotiating, it’s a dangerous giveaway that puts our national security and our technological leadership at risk. I’m calling on the administration to immediately restore these protections so we can keep critical American innovations out of the hands of our adversaries.”
“Trump’s selling off our tech advantage to China because he desperately needed a bargaining chip to end his foolish trade war,”
said Senator Wyden.
“Our national security shouldn’t be up for sale, and we must keep these protections in place so our rivals can’t blunt our competitive edge. My letter urges Trump officials to reverse course on this reckless decision.”
