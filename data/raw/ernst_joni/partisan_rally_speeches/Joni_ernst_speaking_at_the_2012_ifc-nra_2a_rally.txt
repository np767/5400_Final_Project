 Thank you Senator Shelvern says I do need to update that my bio is a little old now this past spring I just went over 20 years of service and I serve it with a rank of lieutenant colonel now I am a battalion commander in the Royal Nation Thank you I really appreciate that and thank you Jev I know he asked you know who is a veteran and I was actually going to start with that but how many again could I please have a show of hands those that have served in our armed forces or those currently serving or those that are veterans please show hands thank you so much for all you don't pass so many people and I'm going to give you the abbreviated biography of Joni K Ernst and so many people have asked me Joni why did you join the military why did you do that and I have to share that years ago when I was at Iowa State University I was selected to participate in an agricultural exchange in the Soviet Union as it was known then I went to the Ukraine with 17 other Iowa students and I have to tell you we got over there and it was a shock growing up on my family farm where we had all of the modern conveniences such as running water and we had tractors we had combines it was very interesting to find out at that time 1989 we got over there and this little tiny collective farm that we were on learning their agricultural practices they had no running water they had one telephone on the collective that belonged to the collective manager they had no flushing toilets they had one television that was black and white and they had no cars my family the entire family had one bicycle this was in a socialist nation when I came back from that trip to the Soviet Union I decided I have got to do something I have got to do something about this I need to defend our Constitution and our rights and I signed up for Army ROTC at Iowa State University and I tell you that was a changing point in my life because although we spent two weeks over there mostly talking here and there about agriculture what we did in the evenings was sit in town hall meetings with all of the leaders of that collective farm all of the influential members of that farm and you know what they were talking to us about not about agriculture they were talking to us about how wonderful it would be to have a country like the United States of America they would ask us the eighteen of us little Iowa students they would ask us tell us about your democracy tell us how your form of republic works what can we do here in the Ukraine to become a great nation like the United States and I can guarantee you we told them too thank you two short years later the USSR was failing it was dissolving and the Ukraine became an independent nation so thank you to all of those folks over there that fought very long and hard to become their own free independent nation but that was my turning point that's the reason that I joined our armed forces I am a veteran and interestingly enough it was during Operation Iraqi Freedom that I first met Congressman King wonderful wonderful man and we're going to make sure he gets reelected aren't we I met him in the middle of the night with four of my soldiers we were at the Quady International Airport and he had asked to speak to a number of us and find out what the soldiers were going through mind you this was in two-throw 2003 early part of the war and we did we sat down and we talked with him about it and he is concerned about our military forces he is concerned about our second amendment rights so we are going to work very hard that he gets reelected up in northwestern Iowa and I will be right behind him I tell you he is one good man but anyway after that experience of serving in the war came back to the states have been so proud to be a member of our armed forces got elected to the Iowa State Senate two years ago when Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds was elected as the Lieutenant Governor I followed in her footsteps she had been my senator and was elected to the Iowa State Senate and while I'm there interestingly enough I will wear a skirt all wear heels all wear lipstick and so many people will come up to me and they will say oh Joni you are so little you are so pretty you know I can't believe that you serve in the military but I guess my answer to that is don't look at what I'm wearing and don't look that I have make up on my face but look at me do you see someone who loves Iowa do you see someone who loves the United States of America I'm a soldier and that's what soldiers look like so I have been very active in the Iowa National Guard and again I serve as a battalion commander but I also volunteer in different capacities and one of those is as the voting assistance officer for the National Guard I do it all on my own time because I want to make sure that our soldiers that are serving in the Iowa Army National Guard have the opportunity to vote while they are deployed we have a number of soldiers that continue to deploy yes we are drawing down but deployments still go on so I feel very strongly about that very strongly about that so I do carry a weapon in the military and I carry a 9 millimeter as an officer but I also believe that not only the second amendment guarantees that the states can have their own militia which is what I would consider my part of I would consider that the Iowa Army National Guard is that standing militia that the states have the right to but there's a second part to that too there is the the part that says as an individual I have the right to bear arms and I do that some of you notice I carry a purse I have a little black purse I carry it with me all the time those that know me well know what I carry in my purse I have I have a beautiful little Smith and Wesson 9 millimeter and it goes with me virtually everywhere but I do believe in the right to carry and I believe in the right to defend myself and my family whether it's from an intruder or whether it's from a government should they decide that my rights are no longer important so we need we need to remember that and I thank you all very much for being here today to support our second amendment rights and as an Iowa State Senator I'm going to make sure that all of you that have little black purses out there too can retain your right to carry the weapon of your choice and furthermore thank you furthermore this fall we need to make sure that we are electing candidates that support those rights and I think it's very important I have other colleagues waiting but again thank you for your support and thank you for supporting the second amendment
