Ernst Statement on the Syrian President’s Visit
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), co-chair of the Abraham Accords Caucus, released the following statement:
“I appreciated the opportunity to host President Al-Sharaa for a frank and constructive discussion on the future of U.S.-Syria relations ahead of his meeting at the White House. President Trump has already shown that he is the peace president, and his decision to engage with Syria as a counterterrorism partner and a potential participant in the Abraham Accords shows his commitment to continue working to deter Iranian aggression. Today’s visit is an important step toward building trust, fostering dialogue, and uniting Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious communities. Under President Trump’s leadership, there is a real opportunity to advance peace in the Middle East and make the vision of a more stable and prosperous world a reality.”
