Ernst Seeks to Return $65 Billion of Unspent COVID Cash to Taxpayers
The COVID emergency ended years ago, but leftover pandemic funds continue paying for pointless projects
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is introducing legislation to claw back more than $65 billion in unspent COVID funds and return the money to taxpayers.
Her
Returning Unspent COVID Funds Act
identifies
$65.5 billion
currently sitting in outdated COVID slush funds that should be returned to the American people. Instead, they continued to fund
drag shows for high school students
in New Hampshire, an
ice cream truck
in California, and massage chairs in Montana.
“The COVID cash bonanza was a $4.5 trillion all-you-can-eat buffet of waste, fraud, and abuse with the cost eaten by taxpayers,”
said Ernst.
“At $38 trillion in debt, the federal government shouldn’t have secret slush funds or be spending them on golf carts, bowling parties, and high school drag shows. While too much money has already been sent out the door, we have a chance to return the remaining $65 billion to the American people.”
