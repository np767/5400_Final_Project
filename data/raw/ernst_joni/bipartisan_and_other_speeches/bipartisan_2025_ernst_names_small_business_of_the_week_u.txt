Ernst Names Small Business of the Week, Paullina Hardware
Throughout this Congress, Chair Ernst plans to recognize a small business in every one of Iowa’s 99 counties.
RED OAK, Iowa – ­­­­­­U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Chair of the Senate Small Business Committee, today announced her Small Business of the Week: Paullina Hardware
of O’Brien County. Throughout the 119th Congress, Chair Ernst plans to recognize a small business in each of Iowa’s 99 counties.
“Paullina Hardware has
hammered
home what it means to support a small-town community, offering reliable service, essential goods, and a friendly face when it’s needed most,”
said Chair Ernst.
“Eric and Heidi Brown’s commitment to preserving hometown convenience and meeting O’Brien County’s needs has truly strengthened the
nuts and bolts
of their community.”
In 2018, Eric and Heidi Brown purchased Weidaman’s True Value Hardware. Now known as Paullina Hardware, the Browns continue more than 50 years of service in Eric’s hometown of Paullina, Iowa. In 2025, they expanded by acquiring the former Shea’s True Value Hardware in Primghar as their second location.
Beyond hardware, the small business provides bike repairs and offers recreational rentals, including kayaks and paddleboards. Most recently, they introduced coffee equipment and home-brewing education, helping folks craft quality coffee at home and bringing neighbors together in meaningful ways.
Stay tuned as Chair Ernst continues to recognize outstanding Iowa small businesses with her Small Business of the Week award.
