Ernst Secures Win to Lower Fertilizer Costs for Farmers
Her work secured an update to the U.S. Critical Minerals List that will drive down costs and safeguard food security.
WASHINGTON – Following the
advocacy
of U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, the Trump administration has
added
both potash and phosphate — key fertilizer components — to the U.S. Critical Minerals List. By bringing the production of these essential ingredients home, today’s announcement will cut fertilizer costs for farmers, strengthen domestic supply chains, and help safeguard America’s food security.
“I will always fight for Iowa farmers, which is why I brought their concerns on fertilizer costs to the highest levels,”
Ernst said.
“After working with the Trump administration, I’m proud to have secured the addition of two key fertilizer ingredients to the U.S. Critical Minerals List. This action will bring production of both potash and phosphate home to drive down prices for both our farmers and consumers. Thank you to Secretary Burgum and President Trump for listening to our farmers and recognizing that both potash and phosphate are indispensable for U.S. agriculture.”
This is the first time phosphate has been included on the U.S. Critical Mineral List.
Background:
Earlier this year, Ernst
led
her colleagues in calling on Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to reinstate potash and add phosphate to the U.S. Critical Minerals List. After he added potash to the draft list, Ernst
continued
her call to action until both key fertilizer ingredients were added.
Ernst has also
worked
to bring more clarity and certainty on fertilizer prices for Iowa farmers through the
Fertilizer Research Act.
