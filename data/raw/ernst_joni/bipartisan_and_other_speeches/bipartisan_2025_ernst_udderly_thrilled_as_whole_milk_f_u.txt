Ernst “Udderly” Thrilled as Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act Advances
WASHINGTON – On behalf of Iowa families and dairy farmers, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) celebrated the Senate passage of the
Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act
, which she cosponsored, so students can receive the full, nutritious benefits of milk.
This effort will allow whole and 2% milk to be served at school meals, overturning an unnecessary Obama-era restriction.
“Join me in raising a glass, or a jug, to celebrate the
Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act
passing the Senate unanimously,”
said Senator Ernst.
“When we encourage students to choose dairy, it’s not only helping them achieve a balanced and nutritious meal; it’s also supporting our Iowa dairy farmers.”
Background:
Ernst is a strong supporter of Iowa’s dairy farmers and has
consistently worked to protect
dairy options in Iowa schools.
