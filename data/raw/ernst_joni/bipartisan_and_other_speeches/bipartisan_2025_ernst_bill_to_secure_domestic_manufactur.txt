Ernst Bill to Secure Domestic Manufacturing Passes Senate
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) announced her bipartisan
Critical Infrastructure Manufacturing Feasibility Act
passed the Senate and is one step closer to becoming law.
The bill will decrease our reliance on foreign adversaries for key materials and drive investment and job creation in the United States. By instructing the Secretary of Commerce to identify critical goods that are currently being imported and find ways to help domestic producers manufacture them in rural areas and industrial parks, this effort will boost manufacturing in rural America.
“I’ve long fought to make ‘Made in America’ the norm instead of the exception. Now that this bill passed the Senate, we are one step closer to enabling our American manufacturers to get the materials they need right here in the heartland,”
said Ernst.
“I will always work to safeguard our national security by ensuring that we are not dependent on any foreign adversary for critical goods that we need.”
