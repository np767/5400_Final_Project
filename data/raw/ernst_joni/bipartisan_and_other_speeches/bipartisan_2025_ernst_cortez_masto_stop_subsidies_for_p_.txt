Ernst, Cortez Masto Stop Subsidies for Political Junk Mail
WASHINGTON – After 2.3 billion
pieces
of political mail flooded America’s mailboxes in 2024, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) are introducing legislation to end subsidies that enable this junk mail to be sent at a
40-60%
discount.
The bipartisan
Ending Subsidies for Political Junk Mail Act
revokes political committees’ ability to send mail through the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) at the discounted non-profit rate.
“No more welfare for Washington consultants,”
said Ernst.
“If the American people must pay full price to send a Christmas card that their families actually want, then political parties should have to pay full price to send junk mail that nobody wants. Especially as the U.S. Postal Service loses billions every year, there is absolutely no reason to subsidize spam that will wind up in the trash.”
“Political campaigns should not be getting government discounts to flood our mailboxes with election materials,”
said Cortez Masto.
“I’m proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Ernst that will provide Americans relief from junk mail.”
