HONORING PETER RICHARD SGRO
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Guam
(Mr. Moylan) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MOYLAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to honor the
life and legacy of the late Peter Richard Sgro, who sadly left this
world on January 9. Peter was iconic on so many levels that his
outside-the-box vision and drive to effectuate change will be deeply
missed.
As an attorney, Peter always believed in seeking justice for his
clients. He never walked away from a fight if he knew that virtue
needed to prevail, and in his case, virtue certainly always prevailed.
As the chairman of the board of the Guam Chamber of Commerce, Peter
evidenced that he was an advocate for small businesses, particularly
the little guy. He stood with them to challenge policies that would
raise the cost of doing business, and his relentlessness ensured that
he wouldn't sit down until compromises were made.
As a businessman, Peter was a visionary, and this was clear when he
worked aggressively to bring a private hospital to open its doors in
Guam. Peter understood the necessities to improve and expand healthcare
for families, and whenever we drive by the Guam Regional Medical City
in the northern part of Guam, we can evidently see Peter's legacy on
display.
For all the roles Peter embraced to help Guam prosper over the
decades, there was none that he enjoyed more than being a father to
Christopher, Matthew, Katarina, and Maria, and a grandfather to
Ricardo, Natalia, and Mila. They were his foundation, his purpose, and
his pride. My heart and my deepest condolences go out to them in this
trying time.
In 2022, as a Guam senator, I had the honor of recognizing Peter and
his legacy as his company, International Group, Inc., was celebrating
an anniversary. I am saddened that in such a short period of less than
2 years, I am recognizing him under a different set of circumstances.
Mr. Speaker, of behalf of a thankful Nation and an appreciative
island of Guam, I honor the life and legacy of Peter Richard Sgro and
thank him for his many contributions to our island community. He will
be dearly missed. Adios to my friend, until we meet again.
