SOUTHERN BORDER CRISIS
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise because December marked the
highest number of illegal immigrant encounters in history with 331
persons on the terror watch list entering the country since President
Biden took office.
President Biden falsely claims that he needs Congress to act to give
him the authority to take control over the border.
Let me be perfectly clear: President Biden has the authority to close
the border today. He can simply direct his staff to enforce existing
laws and reverse the 61 executive actions he has taken to worsen the
border crisis since coming to office.
I will continue using every single tool at my disposal, including the
power of the purse, to force President
[[Page H281]]
Biden to enact meaningful border security reform, such as the
provisions we passed in H.R. 2.
Any action short of securing our border leaves our Nation in peril
and our citizens in jeopardy.
