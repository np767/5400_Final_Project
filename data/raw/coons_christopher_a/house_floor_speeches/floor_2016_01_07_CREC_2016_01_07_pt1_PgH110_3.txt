VIOLENCE AGAINST SIKHS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support and stand with the
Sikh community in the San Joaquin Valley.
In the past 2 weeks, two Sikh men have been brutally attacked and,
very sadly, one of them was killed. He lost his life. The Fresno City
Police Department has labeled these two crimes as potential hate
crimes.
Amrik Singh Bal was attacked in the middle of the street while
waiting for a ride so he could go to work, as any average American
would do throughout our country. Gurcharan Singh Gill was killed while
working at a local convenience store. Both tragic incidents took place
in my district. My thoughts and prayers are with Amrik and his family,
and my deepest sympathy and condolences go to the Gurcharan family for
the loss.
The attacks on these innocent American citizens are really an attack
on all American citizens who choose to practice their religion and
observe their cultural heritage, as Americans do throughout our land.
Sadly, since September 11, 2001, the Sikh community has endured
discrimination because of a lack of understanding of Sikhism, which is
based on equality and love. They are not alone.
As a nation of immigrants, we must remember, we have an opportunity
to learn and benefit from the thousands of different cultures that are
part of the mosaic of what makes America great. After all, we are a
nation of immigrants, both past and present, and we must never ever
forget that.
Today, in Fresno, in spirit, we are all part of the Sikh community as
we mourn these tragic incidents. Every American citizen, regardless of
race, creed, or gender has the right to live free of fear and
discrimination.
I commend Chief Dyer and the Fresno City Police Department for
working diligently to find the individual or individuals who killed
Gurcharan and for continuing to look for the other individuals who are
responsible for the attack on Amrik.
I continue to urge the FBI and the U.S. Attorney General's office to
work, as they have been, in making this investigation inquiry resolve
itself, solving these very sad crimes that we
[[Page H111]]
think were based on hate and is truly an unfair and discriminatory
situation that occurred in the last 2 weeks.
