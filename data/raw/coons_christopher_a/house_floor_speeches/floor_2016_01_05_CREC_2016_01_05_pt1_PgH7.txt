CONGRATULATING WALNUT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND
(Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, this evening I rise to recognize the Walnut
Hills High School Marching Band. They traveled to Paris last week to
participate in La Grande Parade, which runs along the Champs-Elysees.
La Grande Parade is the showcase event in Paris on New Year's Day and
attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators from all over the world.
So it was a great opportunity to show the world just how talented our
students in Cincinnati are. Only four bands from the United States--two
high schools and two colleges--were selected to participate in this
prestigious event.
It is fitting that Walnut Hills was one of those four bands, as the
Marching Blue and Gold have been rated superior for 13 straight years
by the Ohio Music Education Association.
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the students, parents, teachers,
and supporters of Walnut Hills High School, one of the best high
schools in Cincinnati, on this well-deserved honor. I know the students
in the band put in a lot of hard work for this once-in-a lifetime
opportunity. They have truly made our community proud.
Go Eagles.
