PUTTING THE SAFETY OF AMERICANS FIRST
(Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
[[Page H215]]
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, for months Americans have been demanding
stronger FBI background checks on Syrian and Middle Eastern refugees
entering the United States, and just yesterday an ISIS-affiliated
Syrian refugee was arrested in Houston, Texas.
Rather than taking action to address these national security
vulnerabilities, President Obama shockingly believes that it is more
important to increase FBI background checks on law-abiding American
citizens.
This additional round of unconstitutional executive action is a new
low for this administration. Their overreach on guns and law-abiding
Americans shows how truly misplaced their priorities are. Sadly, it
only confirms what we have already come to learn, that this is a failed
President with a very distorted sense of the real world.
Mr. Speaker, putting the safety and security of the American people
first means ending this administration's refusal to secure our borders,
refusal to respect the right of law-abiding Americans to exercise their
First and Second Amendment rights, and refusal to enhance background
checks on immigrants and refugees from the safe havens of terrorism.
