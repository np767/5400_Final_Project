MATER DEI HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. Correa) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate Mater Dei High
School's football team for earning their fourth California State
championship. The Monarchs secured their final win of the season over
an undefeated team with an impressive 35-0 victory.
Their success is a shining example of the dedication, hard work, and
perseverance of the young players, the coaches, and the community.
Also with this win, the Monarchs claimed a top three position in
national rankings and the number one spot in the media composite on the
national level.
I congratulate the students, parents, coaches, and teachers that form
the Monarch football team. You have made us proud. I am looking forward
to next year.
North Orange Continuing Education's 50th Anniversary
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the North Orange County Continuing Education Program.
For half a century, North Orange County Continuing Education has
offered programs that transform lives in Orange County.
Established in 1973, NOCE has grown to serve more than 29,000
students each and every year and offers over a thousand courses each
semester to those of all ages.
The curriculum includes vocational, business, financial, and other
skills that individuals need throughout their life. Also, beyond the
classroom, NOCE has shown the real impact that they have on our
community. In fact, they support over 3,000 jobs directly and
indirectly and offer services to help everyday individuals succeed.
As we celebrate NOCE's 50th anniversary, we reflect back on their
work and look forward to their future and their success in our
community.
Anaheim Public Library
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Anaheim Public
Library's award-winning Foster Youth Initiative that has gained
recognition for making resources available to kids in need.
The library's Foster Youth Initiative offers library cards to youth
who are in the foster care system, who are homeless, or those that have
been emancipated. This card is special. It removes address requirements
and penalties and makes sure that those young people have access to our
community's public library system.
Also, the initiative has been recognized by the Orange County
Business Council's Public-Private Partnership and has received such an
award. It is a testament to the hundreds of library cards that have
been made available to

those students, those young individuals that wouldn't otherwise receive
a library card.
I congratulate the Anaheim Public Library for their commitment to
support our youth in need.
