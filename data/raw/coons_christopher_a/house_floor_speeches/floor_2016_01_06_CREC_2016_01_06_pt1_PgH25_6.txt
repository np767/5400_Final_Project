GUN VIOLENCE AND OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ACTIONS
(Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, I have stood here many times in the last few
years with the same message to my colleagues: Let's take action on gun
violence and save some lives.
I have named horrible statistics on gun death, like young people in
the United States are more likely to be killed by a gun than in a car
accident.
I have told stories about people who have suffered incredible loss,
like Vicky Lindsey from Compton, who lost her son to gun violence and
founded Project Cry No More.
I have cited polls showing bipartisan support from voters for
sensible reforms; but year after year, Congress
[[Page H26]]
has refused to act, despite its knowing how easy it is for criminals
and dangerous people to buy these deadly weapons.
This week there was a bright spot. President Obama has taken
executive action to increase the number of background checks on gun
sales, a move which we know will help to keep guns out of dangerous
hands.
I thank the President, but our work to prevent gun deaths cannot end
there. Congress must finish the job by instituting universal background
checks, banning assault weapons, and closing the dangerous loophole
that allows a gun dealer to sell a gun if the FBI has not completed the
background check within 3 days. We have to act. There is no excuse not
to.
