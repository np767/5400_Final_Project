RECOGNIZING CHEROKEE TRAIL'S STATE CHAMPION VOLLEYBALL TEAM
(Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the girls varsity
volleyball team at Cherokee Trail High School in Aurora, Colorado, for
winning the 2015 Colorado 5A State championship game on November 14,
2015.
The students and staff who were part of the title-winning Cougar team
deserve to be recognized for winning in what has been a season full of
challenges. Following the tragic death of one of their players, Celeste
James, and a serious injury to another, Amazing Ashby, the Cherokee
Trail Cougars showed courage in the face of true adversity to complete
their title-winning season which honored their teammates.
In their dominant performances at the State championship, the girls
of Cherokee Trail High School's volleyball team proved that hard work,
dedication, and perseverance is the perfect recipe for champions. These
volleyball players were led to the championship title through the
tireless leadership of their head coach, Terry Miller, and his
outstanding staff.
It is with great pride that I join all of the residents of Aurora,
Colorado, in congratulating the Cherokee Trail Cougars for their State
championship.
