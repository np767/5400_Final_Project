KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN
(Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, Americans want Congress to focus on
lowering costs and growing the middle class, but extreme MAGA
Republicans continue to create one crisis after the next.
The bare minimum is for Congress to keep the government open, yet
Republicans have repeatedly threatened government shutdowns.
Republicans want a shutdown unless they get harsh and ineffective
border policy changes.
They are willing to hold hostage pay for our troops. At the same
time, Republicans have rejected billions in funding from President
Biden to help secure the border and to create a more orderly process.
Republicans prefer to play politics rather than solve problems.
This week, Democrats will once again provide the majority of votes to
keep the government open. Democrats are here to do our job and put
people over politics. We need to keep the government open so that
American families are not hurt by Republicans' failure to govern.
