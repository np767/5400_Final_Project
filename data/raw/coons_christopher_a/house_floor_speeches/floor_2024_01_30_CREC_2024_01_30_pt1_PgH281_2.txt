HOUSE DEMOCRATS PUT PEOPLE OVER POLITICS
(Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, as MAGA Republicans work overtime to
attack the reproductive rights of women, launch sham impeachments, and
give tax breaks to big corporations, House Democrats are listening to
working families.
House Democrats continue to work for lower costs and grow the middle
class. House Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower drug
prices and the jobs and infrastructure law to rebuild our roads and
bridges.
House Republicans show up at ribbon cutting ceremonies to take credit
for infrastructure projects in their districts, even though they voted
against the infrastructure law. Some Republicans try to hide the fact
that they voted against the very bill they are claiming credit for by
saying, when asked, that they don't remember how they voted.
While Republicans continue their hypocrisy, Democrats are hard at
work to lower costs for childcare, high-speed internet, and energy.
House Democrats will continue to put people over politics to deliver
for everyday Americans.
