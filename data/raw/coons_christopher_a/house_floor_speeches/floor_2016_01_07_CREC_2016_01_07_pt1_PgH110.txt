REDONDO UNION HIGH SCHOOL PROTEST
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. Hahn) for 5 minutes.
Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, this upcoming Monday, the Westboro Baptist
Church plans to hold protests outside of Redondo Union High School in
Redondo Beach, California. We have seen these protests before, often at
the funerals of our fallen servicemen and -women. They are known,
unfortunately, for their hateful message, especially against LGBT
Americans.
The members of this church believe that America's generation of high
schoolers is ``utterly without hope.'' They say that because these
young students are promoting acceptance and inclusion of all people,
regardless of whether they are gay or straight.
I couldn't disagree more with their premise of calling these students
``without hope.'' I think because these students are promoting
acceptance and inclusion of all people, regardless of whether they are
gay or straight, they are building a future full of hope. I have the
utmost faith in the next generation as the future leaders of this
Nation.
Of course, no matter how much I disagree with this group, these
individuals should be allowed to exercise their right to protest, and
they do have a right to free speech in this country. The students have
those same rights, and an inspiring group of Redondo High students are
organizing a peaceful counterprotest on Monday.
Yesterday, I wrote a letter to the members of the school's Gay-
Straight Alliance and told them that I wished I could be there on
Monday to protest alongside of them. These students deserve to live in
a world where they can be who they are and love whom they choose. In
standing up against hate and living a life of acceptance, inclusion,
and understanding, they are making that world a reality.
I know my colleague here, Ted Lieu, who represents Redondo Beach,
joins me in saying that we are so proud of these students. We are proud
of their courage, their bravery, their intelligence, and skill in
standing up for what they know is right, just, and for being brave
enough to organize a counterprotest.
{time}  1045
I am going to be in Washington, D.C., on Monday. But if I were not
here, I would want to be standing alongside each and every student to
show my solidarity with them. Instead, let me tell them that I will be
there in spirit.
