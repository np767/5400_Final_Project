WE NEED TO FIX OUR OUTDATED, BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New
Mexico (Mr. Vasquez) for 5 minutes.
Mr. VASQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak today about a place that I
love, and a place that is vitally important to our Nation.
I am a proud product of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, a culturally
rich binational community, full of opportunity, which helps power
international trade and is key to bringing down the costs of goods for
all Americans.
I understand how disillusioned Americans have become when it comes to
addressing our broken immigration system and the challenges that we
currently face at the border.
I am frustrated myself. That is why I stand here today saying that
both Democrats and Republicans have not done enough to fix our
outdated, broken immigration system. The administration should look to
the leadership and the experience of border House Representatives, like
myself, on immigration reform and border security.
Let me be clear: Republicans haven't brought forward any real
bipartisan solutions that could help alleviate the impacts of the
humanitarian crisis that we are seeing today.
In fact, just this week, Republicans introduced a toothless
resolution that only serves as a political statement that vilifies
immigrants.
Further, Republicans did this in the same week that extreme rightwing
immigration policies in the State of Texas led to the death of two
migrant children who drowned in the Rio Grande. This is disgraceful. It
is not who we are. It is un-American.
Trust me, I am tired of Congress kicking this can down the road for
over 30 years. That is why I have introduced a package of commonsense
legislation that could help solve this problem.
We can fix this crisis, but we can't do it while we lose our
humanity. We can do that by securing our border, while also ensuring
immigrants are treated humanely. After all, we are a Nation of
immigrants.
That means investing in customs agents who work long hours and
providing them with the tools they need to do their jobs. It means
modernizing our legal system to match our needs. It means giving new
Americans the opportunity to fill the jobs that our Nation and our
communities desperately need.
I am a proud Democrat, but I am an American first, and right now that
means holding everybody accountable to bring real solutions to the
American people.
