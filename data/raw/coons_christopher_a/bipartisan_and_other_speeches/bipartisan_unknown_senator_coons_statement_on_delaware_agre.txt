Senator Coons statement on Delaware agreement with OpenAI
October 28, 2025
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) issued the following statement after Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings and OpenAI announced a landmark deal to restructure the company:
“I’m thrilled to hear Attorney General Jennings and OpenAI have reached an agreement that will allow OpenAI to continue its work to unlock AI’s immense potential while better protecting Americans from the risks of this emerging technology. This solution ensures a non-profit focusing on Americans’ best interests remains in control of OpenAI, while providing the company the flexibility it needs to compete in a rapidly changing market. It also reinforces Delaware’s position at the forefront of corporate governance, setting an example of how to support companies as they grow from start-up to multibillion-dollar enterprise.
“Delaware is lucky to have a powerful advocate for the public good in Attorney General Jennings. I’m grateful for her leadership and appreciate OpenAI’s willingness to negotiate, and I look forward to OpenAI calling Delaware home for many years.”
