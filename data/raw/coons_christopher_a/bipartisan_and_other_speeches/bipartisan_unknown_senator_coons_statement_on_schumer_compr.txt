Senator Coons statement on Schumer compromise deal to end shutdown
November 07, 2025
WILMINGTON, Del. – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) issued the following statement regarding the proposal announced by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) earlier this afternoon to end the government shutdown:
“I support the proposal offered by Senator Schumer and Democrats on the Senate floor this afternoon. This compromise reopens the government, provides immediate relief to millions of Americans whose health care premiums are about to skyrocket, and creates a pathway towards a long-term solution for the tax credits that are critical to health care affordability. The proposal also contains major steps forward on the bipartisan annual appropriations process that provides funding for SNAP and WIC. I call on my Republican colleagues to support this compromise proposal so that we can end this shutdown today.”
Senator Coons is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.
