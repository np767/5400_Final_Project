Senator Coons statement on government funding vote
November 09, 2025
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) issued the following statement announcing he would vote against the planned bill to fund the government:
“The federal government has been shut down for 40 days – the longest in our history. All Democrats have fought hard for extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits that make health care affordable for millions. I’m voting against the bill today given it doesn’t extend these valuable tax credits. I understand why some of my Democratic colleagues will support this bill. President Trump and Republicans have not negotiated with Democrats and seem determined to continue to inflict harm on vulnerable Americans not just by making health care less affordable, but also by shutting down food assistance and firing federal employees.
“I will continue to fight for an extension of health care tax credits before they expire at the end of this year. We will have a vote in December on improving health care and extending those credits, and I will intensify my efforts to fight for a winning vote.”
Senator Coons is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.
