CELEBRATING INVEST IN VETERANS WEEK
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate this week as
Invest in Veterans Week as proclaimed by Montana Governor Gianforte.
Currently, nearly 9 percent of the Treasure State's population is
made up of veterans. There are over 78,000 veterans in Montana, the
fifth highest population of veterans per capita of any State.
It is truly an honor and a privilege to represent a State so deeply
rooted in military history. Businesses owned by veterans employ over 5
million people and generate over $1 trillion in revenue annually.
Whether that be through starting their own farm, ranch, or small
business, many of our Nation's heroes come home to their families and
communities ready and eager to find ways they can continue to benefit
and serve our communities.
By investing in our veterans, we are able to provide them with the
resources that they need to continue to use their exceptional talents
and skills that benefit all of us.
Investing in our veterans should not be limited to just this week,
but it should be our mission all year round.
