CONGRATULATING NATHAN KEANE
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and
congratulate Nathan Keane, a remarkable Montanan, who has dedicated his
life to serving and advocating for grain growers throughout the
Treasure State and across our country.
From farming with his father-in-law on their fourth generation family
farm in Loma, Montana, to advocating for policies that benefit Montana
farmers, Nathan has had the ability to truly represent and protect our
way of life.
As past President of the Montana Grain Growers Association, Nathan
has served as a board member, chair of the Domestic Policy Committee,
and chair of the 2022 Annual Convention and Trade Show.
Nathan was elected to serve as secretary to the National Association
of Wheat Growers, expanding his reach and amplifying his voice.
He proved himself to be an effective leader in shaping policy here on
Capitol Hill and advocating for Montana grain growers.
I have had the unique opportunity to get to know Nathan and his
passion for agriculture, and I have no doubt the National Association
of Wheat Growers will thrive with Nathan as their new secretary.
