CELEBRATING MONTANA AG WEEK
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition and
celebration of both National and Montana Ag Weeks.
Food security is national security, and across the Treasure State and
the country, farmers work tirelessly to keep food supplies safe and
plentiful so we don't have to rely on foreign nations to sustain our
population.
Agriculture isn't just an industry in Montana. It is our way of life.
It contributes an average of $5.2 billion a year to the economy.
Producers' hard work, dedication, and resilience play an essential
role in feeding our communities, sustaining our economy, and managing
our land.
While ag production is a vital industry, it doesn't come without its
challenges. Congress must first secure a strong crop insurance program
that gives producers certainty and, secondly, pass my Land and National
Defense Act, which would prohibit the Chinese Communist Party from
buying farmland in our country.
Both initiatives can be included in this year's farm bill to show
producers that folks here in Washington haven't forgotten about them
and have their backs in times of need.
Ag producers deserve recognition for the work they do to take care of
our great Nation.
