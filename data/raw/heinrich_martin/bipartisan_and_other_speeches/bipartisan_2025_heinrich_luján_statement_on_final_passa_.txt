Heinrich, Luján Statement on Final Passage of Funding Bill That Fails to Extend ACA Tax Credits
WASHINGTON
– U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) released the following statement after final passage of a funding bill that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits that hold down health care costs for New Mexico families:
“Let’s be clear: this deal means New Mexicans will pay more for their health care. Donald Trump and Republicans could have protected families from massive premium hikes — but they chose not to, over and over again.
“Republicans love to talk about affordability until it’s time to actually make life affordable for working families. Then they vote to let insurance premiums skyrocket, to let children go hungry, and to let working people fend for themselves.
“New Mexicans can’t afford this deal — and we won’t stop calling out this cruelty for what it is. The president and his allies decided that it didn't matter whether a mom in Farmington could afford her kid’s checkup or a retiree in Las Cruces could keep their health coverage.
“We’re going to keep fighting to make the ACA tax credits permanent and lower health care costs. Because no family should have to choose between keeping the lights on and paying for their health care.”
