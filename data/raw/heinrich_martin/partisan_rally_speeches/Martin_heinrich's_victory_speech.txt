 All right, it's over. John Brawler has conceded in the District 1 Congressional Race, Congressman Martin Heinrichs about to speak. Hello, Democrats. How you doing tonight? Now, how we know tonight we've had some ups and downs, but we are finishing the night on a high. But I like to hear from you, Congressman. You know, back in 2008, when Martin and Julie decided to get in this race, we saw them work hard day in and day out and people didn't give him much of a chance. But they fought every day for New Mexicans. They were elected in 2008. And over 40 years, Democrats have never held this seat. He took it back in 2008. He's got it. So what it means for New Mexico and reelected Martin Heinrich is that we will have a person in Washington who will continue to fight for New Mexico families. Now, there are great privileges, being chair of the State Party, but none more than announcing our next Congressman, our continued Congressman Warren Heinrichs. Thank you all so much. I want to start tonight by recognizing three folks who I think deserve latter applause than I do for all that they've sacrificed in the last two years as I've flown back and forth to Washington DC every week. And I simply could not do this without, it's a little past their bedtime. My wife, Julie, my son Carter and my son, Micah. I want to thank John Borrella for his call a few minutes ago and for the incredibly spirited campaign that he ran. And for his willingness to serve. I want to offer just a few words on why I think we won. And one of the things that I want to talk about first is the this district has always had great constituent services, great staff working for the member. Our official staff took that to a whole new level. And from Steve Hanna to Heather Brewer and every single person working for me. They really have been the best and we've had the best campaign team in the nation. Please give it up for us. But a great campaign team doesn't get you there. If the volunteers never show up. If the supporters don't help. And we had the most incredible, incredible army of folks knocking on doors and making phone calls, hundreds of thousands of them. Give it up to all of you for making this possible. I want to say one last thing about why I believe we won. And one of the reasons why is because we had the courage of our convictions. Unlike a lot of folks this year, I never shrank from the fact that I was proud to have voted for healthcare reform. And I want to thank you for health care reform. And we will keep fighting to make New Mexico the clean energy jobs capital of the world. I'm proud of the fact that we put mortgages here in Albuquerque and throughout New Mexico and people's homes ahead of the Wall Street CEOs at AIG and Goldman Sachs. And finally, I want to thank all of the people of this district. Every single one of them. The ones that were right there making sure we were reelected tonight. And the ones who disagree with me. Because I've learned so much from them. Traveling this district, sitting down with people one on one. And I am in their debt. And this opportunity to serve again is something that means a great deal to me. And I do not take lightly. And I want to thank each and every person in this congressional district. And we will continue to be the leaders of the U.S. and the U.S. I want to leave you with one last thought. Two years ago, we made history together. Tonight, we make history again. The first time a Democrat has ever been reelected to this congressional district. But now that that is done, our nation has as many challenges today as it did yesterday. And it's time for us to roll up our sleeves, work with each other, including across the aisle, and get back to work on behalf of the people of this great state. Thank you all so much.
