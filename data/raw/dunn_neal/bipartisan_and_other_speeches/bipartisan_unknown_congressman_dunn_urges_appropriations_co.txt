WASHINGTON, DC
– Yesterday, Congressman Neal Dunn (Florida-02) sent a letter to the House Appropriations Committee urging them to preserve federal funding for the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) High Magnetic Field Laboratory (MagLab) housed at Florida State University.
“The MagLab at Florida State is home to the world’s highest field magnets and serves as a national and global resource for magnet-related research in nearly all areas of science,”
said Congressman Dunn.
“Significant funding cuts for this facility will weaken national security, cede technological leadership to America’s global adversaries, and lead to the loss of countless good-paying jobs in the Tallahassee community. We cannot afford to cut funding to this indispensable resource, and I urge the Appropriations Committee to keep this important program in mind as it continues its work.”
Background
:
Funding for the MagLab will help Florida State maintain its status as an internationally recognized leader in magnet science, development, and construction. The facility welcomes more than 1,800 researchers annually to advance basic and applied discoveries in quantum materials, biomedicine and biotechnology, energy, engineering, chemistry, materials science, and physics.
In addition to the vital scientific research conducted at the facility, the MagLab employs 562 Floridians and brings $325 million per year to Florida’s economy. The lab is projected to generate $14.2 billion over the next 20 years for the nation. This represents a $6.44 economic return for every $1 invested.
Congressman Dunn is joined by Congressman Jimmy Patronis (Florida-01), Congressman Darren Soto (Florida-09), Congressman Daniel Webster (Florida-11), Congressman Vern Buchanan (Florida-16), Congressman Byron Donalds (Florida-19), Congressman Jared Moskowitz (Florida-23), and Congresswoman Maria Salazar (Florida-27).
