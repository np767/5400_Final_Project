 members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the president. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 4, 2021, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Soto, is recognized for 60 minutes as the design of the majority leader. Madam Speaker, you're in luck. I heard a lot of complaints. No solutions. That's why my colleagues across the aisle lost the 2020 election miserably. We know what they're against. President Biden said it best. What are the Republicans for? What are they for? Some of them joined us and some of the bills I'm about to outline. But the rest of them, it's been nothing. Meanwhile, Democrats deliver. The American Rescue Plan, shots and arms, money and pockets. We stopped another great recession. Can you imagine how we'd be able to respond to Delta or Omicron without passing future relief? Now unemployment's below 4%. We created over six nearly seven million jobs last year. In my district, we were devastated by the Great Recession for closures devastated Central Florida. This time around in 2021, for closures that are down from 2020. Workers in Central Florida lost their homes. Last time around, this time around we put a stop to it. House Republicans voted no. Yet Republican governors took the American Rescue Plan money and responded to our nation's crisis. That's what we should all be doing. Next we go to the bipartisan infrastructure framework. There's huge support among all Americans to upgrade America, our roads and bridges, our ports and airports, our clean water, clean and resilient energy, rural broadband. I have both urban suburban and rural areas of the district and everyone regardless of their party background in my district is excited about this infrastructure. We have had meetings with local officials across the area and they're looking to work with us to upgrade America. According to Republican Senator Rob Portman, it helps fix supply chains in his counterinflationary. That's why 22 senators from their Republican side voted yes and 10 Republican colleagues here in the House voted yes. We applaud these 32 Republicans for joining all Democrats and voting for the infrastructure bill. What did the radical House Republicans do? They attacked their own over infrastructure. What a sad, sad legacy that is. It didn't stop a few of them from trying to take credit though. Trying to take credit for projects despite voting no. But if you vote no and you try to take credit now, the message is clear. America will shame you every day, every time. And now we turn to the Compete Act. Madam Speaker, 32 Republicans join with Democrats to vote for the Senate's version of this. Testing domestic microchip manufacturing, which we do in our district and I'm going to go a little more into that in a moment. Improving supply chain for medical supplies like PPE, like vaccines, telecom, solar, all these critical issues. And yes, making us be able to compete against economic rivals like China, like Russia and others who don't share our values. So in the Senate, they're able to come together, the vast majority of them. And in the House, I hope we are. I hope we have a few of our colleagues. But then there's going to be a conference, right? We're going to conference this, make some deals between the House and the Senate, and we're going to get something together. And that bill is going to come back. That's going to be the last shot. The last shot for both Democrats and Republicans to come together to ensure we could produce millions of new jobs in domestic manufacturing. I want to commend the America Compete Act, Madam Speaker, for including $52 billion to incentivize private sector investments and continue to American leadership in semiconductor manufacturing. Microchip manufacturing to help address supply chain disruptions and ensure more microchips are produced here at home. I've heard from my local auto dealers, I've heard from local manufacturers. We need to make these microchips at home. And this bill helps us do that. Within our district in central Florida, we have the Neocity Technological Campus, which is recognized as an emerging microchips, microelectronics, and advanced manufacturing hub. We've already had made synergies with institutions of higher education across Florida and key partnerships with the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Commerce under both the Trump administration and now under the Biden administration. Neocity is home to bridge a non-for-profit public-private partnership, specializing in domestic semiconductor research, development and manufacturing. I'm Nick, a world-renowned international research and development organization active in the semiconductor design and architecture space, also has a presence there. SUS microtech, a leading supplier of equipment and process solutions for the semiconductor industry, they're working at Neocity and Skywater Technology, the only U.S. owned and operated pure play trusted foundry that works on leading edge advanced packaging technology for microchips and microelectronics. They're all working out in collaboration at the center of Neovation at Neocity, one of the most state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing facilities in Western Hemisphere. As envisioned by this important legislation, the facility and experts at Bridge, I'm Nick, SUS microtech and Skywater Technology offer immediate capability to accelerate U.S. production of critical semiconductor chips, strengthen the domestic supply chain so chips are made right here in America and turbocharged our research capacity. Equally as important, Neocity Academy, a public STEM magnet high school is training the leaders of tomorrow's science and technology workforce. I am proud of the work being undertaken in our district to support domestic semiconductor manufacturing technology development as they work to address the supply chain. I look forward to working with the administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce on implementation of the American Compete Act and the Chip for America Fund. In this bill, we were able to get an amendment to clarify that chip's funding also includes nonprofits like places like Neocity and we appreciate the House for supporting this, adding nonprofits to the definition of covered entities to expand the semiconductor and center program to include nonprofit entities, clarifying that nonprofit entities like 501C3 facilities like Neocity are also eligible for funding under the semiconductor and center program. Before helping with aerospace there, we are starting to work with commercial space like NASA and SpaceX and Blue Origin. The bill also includes my second amendment. We know that we are boosting forward Madam Speaker on artificial intelligence. We need to make sure as we are doing that and seeing more autonomous vehicles and other artificial intelligence uses that we are training our labor force ahead of time for the jobs of today and tomorrow. That's why I'm proud that the AI Jobs Act passed as an amendment and directs the Department of Labor to create a report analyzing the future of artificial intelligence and its impacts on the American workforce. Specifically, the report would collect data to analyze which industries are protected to have the most growth through artificial intelligence and the demographics which may experience expanded career opportunities through and those most vulnerable to job displacement. This is an inclusion of our standalone bill, HR6553, the AI Jobs Act. Thirdly, we were able to include an amendment for the blockchain and crypto currency specialist within the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is required to establish a blockchain and cryptocurrencies advisory specialist position within the office to advise the President on matters related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. OSTP advises the President and others within the executive office of the President of the Scientific, Engineering and Technological aspects of the economy, national security, Homeland Security, Health, Farm Relations and the Environment. It is critical to create such a position within OSTP to ensure there is a policy expert capable of advising the President and others within the executive office on these issues of growing national importance. But wait, there is more Madam Speaker because we got our Restoring Resilient Reefs Act which passed through our Natural Resources Committee to reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act, the CRCA, which expired nearly 15 years ago. It maintains the NOAA Coral Reef Program which also while also introducing overdo improvements to coral management and restoration efforts and giving innovative new tools to partners who are closest to this crisis, states, territories, tribes, communities and universities. We know that the Great Florida Reef is in danger and we are doing everything we can to restore it. It is critical to our recreation, to clean water, to protect habitat and to tourism. A few of the provisions included in the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act, a bipartisan bill that passed out unanimously out of the Natural Resources Committee, include a five-year authorization with the explicit focus on restoration activities where natural disasters and human activities have degraded reef ecosystems. This program is currently funded at $33 million for 2021 but without further direction from Congress. Creates a block grant program where states and territories can receive federal matching funds. For the prior years, coral expenditures provided they have an action plan in place, which will incentivize increased state and local investment in coral reef management capacity. We are also helping inter-governmental partnerships for key, that are key for water infrastructure upgrades, pollution mitigation efforts and re-growing reefs. It allows for the formation of the public-private partnerships for coral management called coral, stewardship partnerships. Public-private partnerships are critical for sharing research. It also authorizes the U.S. coral reef task force to ensure states, territories and other stakeholders, continue to have a voice in U.S. coral reef management. Public feedback is essential. Establishes a single stream line set of guidelines for action plans to implement the national strategy with maximum flexibility given to state and local authorities. These action plans will focus restoration efforts more effectively. They also allow for emergency grants and emergency funds for coral disasters. This is critical for hurricane-prone areas like Florida, and will assist with hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, as well as oil spills and other major pollution events. We thank all House members who supported this for its inclusion in these, along with these technological amendments, these coral reef provisions in this essential piece of legislation that allows us to compete in the 21st century.
