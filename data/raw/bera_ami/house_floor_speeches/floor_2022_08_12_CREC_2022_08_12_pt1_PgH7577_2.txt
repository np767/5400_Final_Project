Motion to Concur
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion.
The text of the motion is as follows:
Mr. Yarmuth moves that the House concur in the Senate
amendment to H.R. 5376.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1316, the
motion shall be debatable for 3 hours equally divided among and
controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority members of the
Committees on the Budget, Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means, or
their respective designees.
The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), the gentleman from
Missouri (Mr. Smith), the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the
gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), the gentleman from
Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) each
will control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.
General Leave
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks
and insert extraneous material into the Record on the Senate amendment
to H.R. 5376.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the
gentleman from Kentucky?
There was no objection.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today is a big deal for
American families and a big deal for our planet.
The Inflation Reduction Act will lower healthcare costs and energy
costs for American families. It will allow Medicare to negotiate lower
prescription drug prices and cap drug costs for seniors, saving many
Medicare beneficiaries hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars each
year.
This legislation finally makes the biggest corporations start paying
their fair share in taxes, and it ensures that rich tax cheats start
paying what they owe.
The Inflation Reduction Act is fiscally responsible, fully paid for,
and has been strongly endorsed by top U.S. economists across the
political spectrum.
Not one American family making less than $400,000 a year will see
their Federal tax bill increased by this legislation, not by a penny.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also the biggest investment the U.S.
Government has ever made to combat climate change. It leapfrogs us
ahead of nearly every other country in terms of our commitment to
tackling this crisis.
Now, we have seen a lot of Republicans spreading misinformation about
this legislation, and it is for one reason and one reason only: They
are scared. They know the provisions of this bill are overwhelmingly
popular, yet because they consider it a Democratic bill, every single
one of them will be voting against it. This is a crystal-clear example
of Republicans putting party before country.
Just look at the numbers.
Mr. Speaker, 77 percent of Americans support placing caps on
prescription drug prices to lower healthcare costs. That is a key
component of this bill.
Mr. Speaker, 83 percent of Americans support allowing Medicare to
negotiate drug prices to make healthcare more affordable. That is
another key component of this bill.
Two-thirds of Americans think the government should do more to combat
climate change. This bill takes on climate change with the urgency it
deserves.
By opposing this bill, Republicans are making it very clear where
they stand: not with the American people, not with their priorities or
needs, but with Big Pharma, with corporate lobbyists, with tax cheats.
The American people are on our side. They want this bill. Today, in a
huge victory for them, we will send it to the President's desk to be
signed into law.
Let me remind my Republican colleagues what they are voting against.
They are voting against cutting prescription drug prices for their
constituents--in many cases, for lifesaving medication. They are voting
against combating inflation and lowering energy costs when American
families are desperate for us to take action. They are voting against
providing the largest Federal investment ever to combat the climate
crisis and its life-threatening consequences.
I could not be more proud that I will not only be voting ``yes'' on
this bill but that this historic legislation will bear my name.
With or without Republican support, today, we will make a real
difference. We will use the power of the Federal Government to make
American lives better and our country and planet safer. In other words,
we will do our job.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I will take a moment to recognize our
colleague, Jackie Walorski. We come back to the Capitol with very heavy
hearts. Just over a week ago, we lost Jackie and two of her staffers,
Emma Thomson and Zachery Potts, while they were in their public
service.
I was lucky enough to serve with Jackie on the Ways and Means
Committee and worked with her numerous hours. I know that the Ways and
Means Committee will miss her dearly. The people of this body will miss
her dearly. I know that the people of Indiana will miss her very
dearly.
Mr. Speaker, I will say that Jackie was one of the hardest working
public servants that I have ever met, and when she gave you her word,
it was written and carved in stone. For that, she will always be in our
hearts.
Mr. Speaker, as we turn to the legislation before us today, this
week, we found out inflation remains at a 40-year high, having risen
13.7 percent since Biden became President. Real wages have decreased by
4.5 percent.
Americans are suffering. Are we here debating how to alleviate that
suffering? No. We are debating what Democrats call the Inflation
Reduction Act, which everyone from the Congressional Budget Office to
230 different economists--even Senator Bernie Sanders--says will not
actually reduce inflation.
{time}  1200
When you strip away the fake sunset policies, this bill spends $745
billion and adds $146 billion to our debt. It adds $54 billion worth of
debt just in the first 5 years, and 80 percent of their ``budget
deficits'' don't even begin until after the year 2029.
So lots of spending up front, lots of debt up front, and then maybe
savings 8 years from now. How is that going to put out the fire of
inflation when the price of groceries is up 13.1 percent over the past
year?
Senators Manchin and Schumer, Secretary Yellen, and former President
Obama are all on record saying you don't raise taxes during a
recession. But that is exactly what this bill does. It includes $599
billion in new taxes and budget gimmicks. Half of the tax burden falls
on taxpayers making less than $400,000 a year.
The choice this bill puts in front of families making less than
$200,000 is clear. Put the government at the center of your healthcare
decisions or face a $10 billion tax burden. But it gets worse. This
bill doubles the size of the IRS. It doubles the size of the IRS, so it
can target and audit more middle-class families and snoop into their
bank accounts. I am not sure how subjecting Americans to more audits
solves the inflation crisis.
Mr. Speaker, in my home State of Missouri, this bill would quadruple
the number of audits, 18,000 more audits on hardworking Americans who
make less than $200,000 a year. Of course, that is not the only point
of this bill. This is about Democrats' Green New Deal agenda.
My colleagues on the other side will come down here today not to talk
[[Page H7647]]
about inflation, not to talk about gas prices but to instead talk about
the hundreds of billions of dollars that is being spent on radical
environmental projects. And you know what, they will be exactly right.
Half of the spending--over $400 billion--goes to things like:
$3.4 billion for tree equity. Tree equity, that surely is going to
bring down gas prices;
$7.5 billion for new luxury electric vehicles in tax credits for
families who make up to $300,000 a year. That should definitely curtail
inflation;
$27 billion for a national climate bank slush fund at the EPA. That
should definitely help our supply chain crisis;
A $362 million handout to corporate America to make their office
buildings much greener. That will definitely help secure our southern
border.
Mr. Speaker, Democrats believe they can spend their way out of
inflation and tax their way out of a recession. It will only make the
suffering Americans face today that much worse.
This bill is simple. It is welfare for the wealthy environmentalists
and big corporations, paid for by increased taxes and audits on middle-
and low-income taxpayers. These hardworking Americans are the ones that
have been forgotten under the one-party Democrat rule in Washington.
The Washington and wealthy elites win again.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the Assistant Speaker.
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for
yielding.
Mr. Speaker, this is exactly what the American people need. It lowers
costs, it creates great-paying jobs, and it makes our communities safer
by addressing the lethal effects of climate change.
Seniors won't have to choose between putting food on the table and
paying for their prescription drugs;
More families are going to be able to afford healthcare;
Homes and cars will be more affordable and efficient;
U.S. companies will be able to create great-paying jobs and lead the
clean technology revolution;
Billionaires and corporations will finally have to pay their fair
share while working people will have more money in their pockets;
Costs will be lower, water will be cleaner, green jobs will be
plentiful, and our future will be brighter.
In every way, this game-changing bill moves America forward.
Democrats are lowering costs for everyday Americans. We are standing up
to special interests who have blocked cutting the cost of prescription
drugs over and over again and America's critical transition to clean
energy.
We are rebuilding a stronger, greener economy. We are infusing the
tax system with fairness. This is a win for the American public. This
is a win for people over politics.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from the great State of Iowa (Mrs. Hinson).
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this so-
called Inflation Reduction Act.
Last year, we warned that spending trillions of dollars would cause
prices to spike but Democrats did it anyway--ramming through a
trillion-dollar Washington pork buffet, sticking families with the
bill.
Now, Speaker Pelosi is arguing for yet another tax-and-spending
spree, wasting hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars on Green New
Deal priorities and raising taxes on middle-class families.
This will worsen inflation. It sics the IRS on hardworking Iowans--
adding 87,000 new IRS agents to target taxpayers.
Iowans are begging for us to get prices down, but instead, this bill
takes more of their hard-earned paychecks. And for what? So the wealthy
can get a discount on their electric vehicles? So we can increase
bureaucracy at the EPA to impose new regulations on our farmers?
Mr. Speaker, this bill ignores the pain that Iowans are feeling. It
is the worst policy at the worst possible time.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this latest tax-and-spending
spree.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. Jeffries), the Democratic Caucus chair, and a distinguished
member of the Budget Committee.
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for
yielding and for his leadership.
Mr. Speaker, we are once again getting big things done for everyday
Americans.
We passed the American Rescue Plan, saved the economy, put shots in
arms, money in pockets, and kids back in school.
We passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to fix our
crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good-paying jobs.
We passed gun safety legislation for the first time in 30 years that
will save lives.
We passed the CHIPS and Science Act that will bring back domestic
manufacturing jobs to the United States of America.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Inflation
Reduction Act, another transformative bill brought to you by your
friendly neighborhood Democratic Party.
The Inflation Reduction Act will lower energy costs; confront the
climate crisis with the fierce urgency of now; set our planet forward
on a sustainable trajectory; lower healthcare costs by strengthening
the Affordable Healthcare Act, as well as reducing the deficit by $300
billion, and giving Medicare the ability to use its bulk-price
purchasing power to drive down the high cost of lifesaving prescription
drugs.
It is a big F-ing deal.
The Inflation Reduction Act is going to dramatically improve the
lives of everyday Americans. We are putting people over politics.
Fighting to lower costs for safer communities and better paying jobs.
My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Republicans, will
oppose this groundbreaking legislation. They would rather defend Donald
Trump than defend the American people.
Vote ``yes'' on the Inflation Reduction Act so we can continue to put
people over politics.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. Cline).
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, we know the real story. We know what happened a year and
a half ago when the so-called American Rescue Plan was passed--40-year
high inflation rates resulted. We see now what the result is from the
Build Back Better plan that had no chance of passage in the Senate.
This is the offspring of Build Back Better.
Even Bernie Sanders, a socialist who can come up with a million
flawed excuses to spend your tax dollars, says he can't find a way to
even say this would reduce inflation one iota.
We know that instead of fostering American energy independence,
increasing purchasing power for the American family, and reducing
inflation, this bill includes:
$16.5 billion in higher taxes for those making less than $200,000 a
year;
$38 billion in new taxes on American oil and gas producers, which
will be passed along to consumers in the form of even higher costs for
heating homes and gas prices, and;
$480 billion in tax hikes that will hit workers through slashed
wages.
Half the bill is Green New Deal climate change special interest
funding, including taxpayer-funded subsidies on electric vehicle
purchases, and;
$80 billion to double the size of the IRS, creating an army of new
enforcement agents.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this horrible legislation.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from
New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the distinguished chair of the
Committee on Oversight and Reform.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, as chair of the
Committee on Oversight and Reform, I rise in strong, strong support of
the Inflation Reduction Act.
My committee conducted a 3-year investigation of prescription drug
prices. Our findings overwhelmingly support the need for this bill's
reforms to curb the drug industry's outrageous pricing practices and
make prescription drugs more affordable for patients and taxpayers.
[[Page H7648]]
These reforms include empowering Medicare to negotiate prices for
certain drugs, a step that is long overdue.
My committee's investigation into the fossil fuel industry showed
that Big Oil is refusing to take adequate steps to cut emissions, even
though burning fossil fuels is a primary driver of the climate crisis.
This bill will finally bring down emissions from fossil fuels, helping
our environment.
I am proud to have championed other provisions in the bill, including
a historic investment of $3 billion to electrify the Postal Service
delivery fleet. This will replace tens of thousands of gas-guzzling
trucks with clean, electric vehicles, helping our environment.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to cast my vote for the Inflation Reduction
Act today.
Mr. Speaker, as Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform,
I rise in support of the Inflation Reduction Act.

I am honored to cast my vote for the Inflation Reduction Act today.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Iowa (Mr. Feenstra).
Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Smith for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I would just quickly note that I am highly offended by
the use of the foul language by my Democrat colleague. That is
completely unacceptable.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the Democrats'
inflation expansion act. This wasteful bill is full of liberal
priorities that will continue to fuel inflation, raise taxes on
hardworking families, and create an army of 87,000 IRS agents that will
go after our families and small businesses.
Democrats claim that only large corporations will be the target of
these IRS agents. That is factually false. Families and small
businesses, who don't have the time or the resources, will undergo
these invasive audits and will bear the brunt of these IRS agents. This
radical bill will also supercharge the Democrats' Green New Deal agenda
without making our country energy independent again.
In fact, they would rather import dirty foreign oil from Venezuela
than unleash America's energy independence. Sadly, that is the state of
today's Democratic Party and their failed liberal agenda.
Mr. Speaker, as a strong fiscal conservative, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this bill.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on
Education and Labor, and a member of the Budget Committee.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, with the passage of this bill,
Medicare will finally be able to negotiate for lower drug prices. The
bill extends the American Rescue Plan's reduction in the cost of
insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which has helped us reach the
lowest number of uninsured people ever.
The bill will make the largest ever investment to address climate
change. I am especially pleased with the bill's provisions to
turbocharge the development of offshore wind.
As chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, I am encouraged
by the permanent extension of the black lung excise tax. The extension
will fund future benefits in healthcare for miners in southwest
Virginia and across coal country who are suffering from black lung
disease. Extending the tax will protect the long-term sustainability of
the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund by ensuring that the coal industry
does not shift the cost of benefits from coal companies to miners,
families, or the taxpayer. All of this while simultaneously reducing
the Federal deficit.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.
{time}  1215
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Colorado.
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, insanity is doing the same thing
repeatedly and expecting a different result. That makes the supporters
of this legislation, by definition, insane.
Reckless spending in this town is what causes inflation. We cannot
continue to increase taxes on the American people and put a target on
American energy production while spending a historic $370 billion on
Green New Deal initiatives and expect to lower inflation and improve
our economy.
Remember that so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill? We spent $200
billion on Green New Deal initiatives. I guess that was just a
downpayment on this never-ending theft of American tax dollars. You are
sacrificing American families at the altar of climate change.
Mr. Speaker, isn't it so? Joe Biden himself said the inflation rate
is at zero percent. What the heck are we doing here? Why are we passing
this so-called Inflation Reduction Act if it is at zero percent?
In fact, it is the inflation enhancement act, and it does the exact
opposite of what Americans need right now. This is just another con
game by the Democrats calling something one thing and saying another.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds
to the gentlewoman from Colorado.
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, this bill hires 87,000 new IRS agents, and
they are armed. The job description tells them that they need to be
required to carry a firearm and expect to use deadly force if
necessary.
Excessive taxation is theft. The chairman said that we are using the
power of the Federal Government in this bill. You are darn right you
are. You are using the power of the Federal Government for armed
robbery on the taxpayers. I can see why this was rushed through
committee and put on the floor.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again
expired.
The gentlewoman is no longer recognized.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I will say in response to the gentlewoman from Colorado
(Mrs. Boebert) that this is typical of what the Republicans are doing.
First of all, they are making up numbers. There is nowhere anywhere
that shows that 87,000 new IRS agents are going to be hired in this
bill. That is a totally fabricated number. The idea that they are
armed--I know that Mrs. Boebert would like everybody to be armed, as
they are in her restaurant, but that is not what IRS agents do.
Mr. Speaker, I would implore my Republican colleagues to cut out the
scare tactics, quit making things up, and debate the substance of this
bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.
Peters), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, today, we write a bold new chapter in our
history by passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which will
substantially lower the cost of living for San Diegans and all
Americans.
We are turning our climate ambition into climate action by
establishing a methane fee to reduce harmful emissions, creating a
clean energy technology bank, and funding wildfire resiliency efforts
and clean energy infrastructure.
Together, these investments will cut our greenhouse gas emissions by
40 percent by 2030 and create 1.5 million good-paying jobs.
This legislation is also the largest downpayment in deficit reduction
since I have served in Congress. Importantly, the drug pricing reform
framework I helped author will help seniors at the drug counter and
protect private-sector innovation, and it has earned enough votes to
pass the Senate.
[[Page H7649]]
The Inflation Reduction Act is a historic measure. After months of
negotiations and hard work, let's finally get this done. Vote ``yes.''
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record notice
from the Congressional Budget Office that we received just this
morning, as a matter of fact. Yes, the bill in front of us and the
numbers it claims does include additional audits on individuals making
less than $400,000 a year.
CBO has received a number of questions regarding our
estimate of an amendment offered by Senator Crapo during the
floor debate on H.R. 5376 last weekend. That amendment,
#5404, would limit the use of additional funds for the
Internal Revenue Service. If the amendment had been adopted
none of the additional funds could have been used to audit
taxpayers with taxable incomes below $400,000.
CBO did not complete a formal cost estimate in advance of
consideration of the amendment but the agency did provide the
following information to the Senate Budget Committee:
CBO estimates that the amendment 5404 would have the
following effects:
No effect on outlays in the one or ten year budget windows;
would reduce outlays in the five year budget window.
No effect on revenues in the one year budget window; would
reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the
provisions of section 10301 in the five and ten year budget
windows.
No effect on outlays after 2031 but would decrease the
``non-scorable'' revenue resulting from the provisions of
section 10301 after 2031.
CBO has not completed a point estimate of this amendment
but the preliminary assessment indicates that amendment 5404
would reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the
provisions of section 10301 by at least $20 billion over the
FY2022-FY2031 period.
Thanks,
Leigh Angres,
Director of Legislative Affairs
Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the
gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).
Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the Democrats printed and spent
trillions of dollars we didn't have, and they unleashed the worst
inflation in 40 years. They waged war on capitalism and the energy
industry and produced an economic recession.
Now, they are doubling down on these foolish policies. The more that
some people invest in their mistakes, the less willing they are to
admit them.
They are adding 87,000 new IRS agents--that is larger than the entire
population of Flint, Michigan--in order to collect $200 billion in new
taxes, mostly from middle-class families and shopkeepers who don't have
the resources to contest expensive audits.
They are adding $300 billion in new corporate taxes, which will be
passed on to families as higher prices, lower wages, and lower returns.
All of this is to give away three-quarters of a trillion dollars more
of your earnings to their green energy cronies and other political
supporters. That averages about $6,000 per household.
Just as you cannot drink yourself sober, you cannot spend your way
out of inflation, or tax yourself out of recession, or borrow your way
out of debt. Yet, that is exactly what the Democrats claim they can do.
What makes them think socialism will work any better here than
everywhere else in the world that it has been tried?
This bill takes our country further into this dismal future, and only
more suffering and poverty will come of it.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. Kildee), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Inflation Reduction
Act to help fight inflation and lower costs for the Michigan families
and seniors that I represent.
With this bill, we will be able to lower healthcare costs for
Michigan families and seniors. This bill will allow Medicare to
negotiate the cost of prescription drugs, including capping the cost of
insulin for seniors at $35 a month.
With this bill, we will create good-paying jobs to combat the climate
crisis. This bill will invest in domestic clean energy production and
manufacturing facilities to lower costs. It will support making solar
panels at companies like Hemlock Semiconductor and electric vehicles in
Michigan, not in China.
With this bill, which is fully paid for, we will ensure the biggest
corporations and the wealthiest individuals pay their fair share of
taxes. Right now, 55 of the Nation's biggest corporations pay zero in
Federal taxes while making billions in profits. A Flint nurse, a
Saginaw farmer, or a Bay City teacher should not pay more in taxes than
the largest, wealthiest, most profitable corporations.
Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter
from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which confirmed that
this bill will raise the cost of new prescription drugs for all
Americans.
U.S. Congress,
Congressional Budget Office,
Washington, DC, August 4, 2022.
Re Additional Information About Prescription Drug
Legislation.
Hon. Jason Smith,
Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
Dear Congressman: This letter provides additional
information that you and your colleagues requested about
subtitle I of the reconciliation recommendations of the
Senate Committee on Finance regarding prescription drug
legislation. You asked about how provisions involving
inflation rebates and the negotiation of drug prices would
affect launch prices for new drugs and the introduction of
new generic drugs. You also asked how a provision to
stabilize premiums as a part of the redesign of Medicare's
benefits would affect the federal budget and premiums.
Effect of the Inflation-Rebate and Negotiation Provisions on Launch
Prices
The Congressional Budget Office projects that the
inflation-rebate and negotiation provisions would increase
the launch prices for drugs that are not yet on the market
relative to what such prices would be otherwise. That effect
would primarily be driven by the inflation-rebate provisions
(sections 129101 and 129102), which would begin to apply to
prices within 12 months of a given drug's entering the
market. Under those provisions, manufacturers would have an
incentive to launch new drugs at a higher price to offset
slower growth in prices over time. The negotiation provision
(section 129001) would have less of an impact on launch
prices, CBO expects: Although the ceiling for a drug's
negotiated price is based on its price from a prior year,
negotiation could not occur until drugs were on the market
for a number of years--at least 7 for small-molecule drugs
and 11 for biologics.
Higher launch prices would primarily affect spending for
drugs in the Medicaid program, CBO projects, because an
increase in that program's basic rebate brought about by the
higher launch prices would only partly offset those prices.
Higher launch prices would also tend to affect spending for
drugs covered by Part B of the Medicare program because that
program's payments for those drugs are based on the average
sales prices. Over time, slower price growth would attenuate
the effect of higher launch prices.
In the commercial and Medicare Part D segments of the
market, spending would be less affected by higher launch
prices, CBO estimates, because manufacturers would have more
flexibility to manage rebates to maximize their revenues in
those sectors.
Effect of the Negotiation Provision on the Introduction of New Generic
Drugs
CBO has not analyzed the effects of the negotiation
provision on the introduction of new generic drugs. In
projecting the effects of the negotiation provision, CBO
estimated the share of spending that would be subject to
negotiation each year and the average reduction in prices
that would stem from the negotiations. But the agency did not
analyze how the provision would affect prices or spending on
specific drugs, nor did it quantify any impact on the
introduction of new generic drugs.
Effects of the Premium-Stabilization Provision
Under the premium-stabilization provision (section 129201),
the federal government would subsidize any growth in
beneficiaries' base premiums for Medicare Part D exceeding 6
percent from one year to the next over the 2024-2029 period.
The provision subsequently would lower the base premium
percentage (the percentage of the average cost of standard
Part D coverage that is used to calculate beneficiaries'
premiums) to ensure that premiums did not grow by more than 6
percent between 2029 and 2030. That subsidy and subsequent
reduction in premiums would increase federal spending by
roughly $40 billion over the 2024-2031 period, CBO estimates.
Beneficiaries' spending on premiums would be lower under the
premium-stabilization provision than it would be without it.
That estimate is an average effect among the possible paths
of premiums that CBO considered when modeling the uncertainty
of future outcomes. Under some of those paths, premiums would
grow by less than 6 percent a year, and the provision would
have no cost; under others, premiums would grow faster, and
the provision would generate costs.

I hope this information is useful to you and your
colleagues. Please contact me if you have further questions.
Sincerely,
Phillip L. Swagel,
Director.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. Good).
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the Democrats are determined to
make inflation worse by continuing their disastrous policies that
caused it in the first place. Do they not understand the concept of
pouring gas on a fire?
Beyond the reckless spending of nearly another trillion dollars on
top of the $30 trillion national debt--there is no climate crisis. It
is a hoax. This is the one crisis that even Democrats couldn't create.
They have been crying about the climate sky falling for 40 years now,
predicting the world would end in 12 years. It is a lie.
We are the cleanest large energy producer in the world, and fossil
fuels are a wonderful thing. They are essential to our economic and
national security.
Worse yet, Democrats want to spend $80 billion to hire 87,000 more
armed IRS agents to terrorize Americans with 1.2 million more audits of
hardworking taxpayers. No one in my district has ever told me that the
one thing we need is more IRS agents.
Mr. Speaker, the American people will vote against this bill on
November 8.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, we just heard the big lie a couple more
times about 87,000 IRS agents that are going to be armed. It is total
bunk. Nonsense. The Republicans should stop it and tell the truth. They
are continuing to say it.
I will say one thing. We were informed last week by the Commissioner
of the IRS, Mr. Rettig, an appointee of former President Trump, that
audits would not increase for anybody making under $400,000 a year.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.
Jayapal), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, today, Democrats will take unprecedented
and urgent action when we pass the Inflation Reduction Act.
Today, we make good on our promise to take on climate change and
climate justice with historic investments in green technologies that
will cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030, create over 9 million
good jobs, put $60 billion into environmental justice, and cut energy
costs for the average American family by almost $1,000 a year.
Also, for the first time, we take on Big Pharma's price gouging,
finally allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices,
capping the cost of insulin, and continuing to make healthcare more
affordable. All of it is paid for with taxes on the largest
corporations and the wealthiest.
We have more to do to complete the rest of the President's agenda on
childcare, senior care, expanding Medicare, and investing in housing.
With a few more Democrats in the Senate, we will get that done, too.
Today, let's celebrate this massive investment for the people. People
over politics. Let's pass this bill.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from
Washington State, and I would just like to point out that by doubling
the size of the IRS and adding 87,000 new IRS agents, that will result
in more than 20,000 of her families in Washington State who make less
than $20,000 a year that will be receiving audits.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin
(Mr. Grothman).
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, the 87,000 figure is entirely reasonable,
given we have an $80 billion increase. Now, is it exact? It might be
86,500. I don't know. It is a big number.
First of all, it is that many more people monitoring Americans.
Anybody that wants a free society should be afraid of that.
Secondly, with 86,500 people poking around small business, it means
that much more accountant time that has to be paid for by the small
businesses. It means that many more lawyers hired by the small
businesses. It is really an accountant and legal make-work program.
Auditing on this scale will really change the amount of time you have
to deal with this.
Other things, you are getting rid of--I am very disappointed--the
good provision you had with regard to carried interest. You are finally
going after some of the billionaires of this country, and I wish you
wouldn't have caved into the Senate and removed that provision. That
was a very good thing.
Next, you have way too much corporate welfare in here. $134 billion
in tax credits for so-called favored green industries. What is it? It
is that many more businesses depending upon government, and their way
to make money is not by providing something the American citizen wants.
They are making money because of tax credits they have been given by
Congress.
Otherwise, the bill is full of other big spending, as well. There is
a 22 percent increase in Bureau of Indian Affairs, 22 percent at a time
when we are choking on inflation because of excessive government
spending. That is one more spending program to put in here.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their
comments to the Chair.
{time}  1230
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. Lee), who is a distinguished member of the Budget
Committee.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. I thank the chairman for yielding his
time and also for his leadership.
This historic bill puts people over politics by lowering the cost of
living for necessities like healthcare, creating good-paying jobs, and
ensuring that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share of
taxes.
Now, we know that lower-income communities and communities of color
face the brunt of pollution and climate change. This bill makes the
single largest investment in combating climate change and works to
reduce carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030. We still have a lot
ahead, though, and much more work to do, like fighting for investments
that have deep impacts on communities of color, such as housing, the
child tax credit, investments in our care economy, universal childcare,
and insulin caps beyond Medicare which disproportionately impacts
people of color. But make no mistake, this bill will make an impact on
families and our planet.
It is a shame and disgrace that Republicans won't vote for this bill.
But this bill helps Republican constituents also.
So I am so proud today to vote for this bill for our Republican
constituents.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record notice
from over 230 economists that this bill before us today would only
increase inflation.
[From FOX Business, Aug. 4, 2022]
Over 230 Economists Warn Manchin's Spending Bill Will Perpetuate
Inflation
(By Kelly Laco)
A letter sent to House and Senate leadership from 230
economists argues that the Inflation Reduction Act is
expected to contribute to skyrocketing inflation and will
burden the U.S. economy, contrary to President Biden and
Democrats' claims.
The economists wrote in the letter first obtained by Fox
News Digital that the U.S. economy is at a ``dangerous
crossroads'' and the ``inaptly named `Inflation Reduction Act
of 2022' would do nothing of the sort and instead would
perpetuate the same fiscal policy errors that have helped
precipitate the current troubling economic climate.''
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va, announced last week he reached an
agreement with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, on
the $739 billion reconciliation Package after more than a
year of negotiations among Democrats.
The economic experts point to the $433 billion in proposed
government spending, which they argue ``would create
immediate inflationary pressures by boosting demand, while
the supply-side tax hikes would constrain supply by
discouraging investment and draining the private sector of
much-needed resources.''

They also write that of ``particular concern'' is the
corporate minimum tax that they say will undercut efforts to
restore functioning supply chains.
In addition, the bill's prescription drug provisions
``would impose price controls that
[[Page H7651]]
threaten healthcare innovation, creating a human health toll
that would add to the financial woes that Americans are
already experiencing.''
A few of the notable signers include Nobel laureate Vernon
Smith, former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Kevin
Hassett, former Director of the Office of Management and
Budget Jim Miller and Robert Heller, former president of the
Federal Reserve Board 1986-1989.
In addition, professors from the University of Chicago,
Princeton University, Duke University, the University of
Virginia, Columbia University and the University of Notre
Dame, among others, were listed on the letter dated Aug. 3.
The experts conclude that although they agree with an
``urgent'' need to address inflation, Manchin's bill is a
``misleading label'' applied to legislation that would
achieve the ``opposite effect''
President Biden urged Congress to pass the bill during a
virtual roundtable Thursday. ``My message to Congress is
this: Listen to the American people,'' he said. (Jonathan
Ernst/File Photo/ Reuters)
The letter was sent to Schumer, Senate Minority Leader
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.
Schumer has touted the Inflation Reduction Act as an
immediate solution to inflation, which reached a new 40-year
high last month.
``The Inflation Reduction Act will lower inflation, lower
the costs of prescription drugs, close loopholes long
exploited by big business who pay no or little taxes,''
Schumer said Thursday on the Senate floor.
In addition, Biden urged Congress to pass the bill during a
virtual roundtable Thursday. ``My message to Congress is
this: Listen to the American people,'' he said.
``This is the strongest bill you can pass to lower
inflation, continue to cut the deficit, reduce health care
costs, tackle a climate crisis and promote America's energy
security and reduce the burdens facing working-class and
middle-class families,'' Biden continued.
However, Republicans are less enthusiastic about the more
than $700 billion spending and tax package.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told Fox News that
the bill raises taxes and ``calling it an inflation reduction
bill is rather laughable.'' (J. Scott Applewhite) (AP Images)
McCarthy told Fox News on Wednesday that ``Democrats have
no plans to solve all the problems they created'' and
Manchin's bill is not the solution.
In the Senate, McConnell stated this week that most of his
colleagues were ``somewhat shocked'' about Manchin's reversal
of previous positions He continued, telling Fox News that the
bill raises taxes and ``calling it an inflation reduction
bill is rather laughable.''
``Democrats are catastrophically out of touch with what
American families actually care about. Their approval ratings
show it. And their reckless taxing and spending spree proves
it, as well,'' said McConnell in a statement this week.
The Senate is set to convene on Saturday to vote on a
procedural motion to move the bill forward. It is still
unclear if Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., will support the
legislation, and her vote is necessary for final passage of
the bill under reconciliation rules that would allow a
majority to pass.
Democrats previously touted a letter from 126 economists
supporting Manchin's bill.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. Donalds).
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this terrible bill
because this terrible bill will increase the cost of energy on every
hardworking American in the United States.
This bill actually calls for a doubling of the excise tax on oil and
on gas, doubling of the royalties on oil and on gas.
I was in my district yesterday with Americans for Prosperity at the
True Cost of Washington event where they actually brought down the
price of gasoline to $2.38, the price it was before Joe Biden took
office. I had families in my district crying because they could finally
put gas in their cars and food on their dinner table in that day.
The Democrats come here today, and they want to lecture us about
putting people over politics?
That is a joke, and it is a lie.
These tax increases on oil and gas will only hurt poor families all
across America. I don't care if you are in Seattle, Washington; I don't
care if you are in Miami, Florida; you could be in Chicago, Illinois;
New York City; or San Francisco, California; those tax increases hurt
the very poor among us, and the Democrats are cool with it.
Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on this bill.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is a distinguished member of the Budget
Committee.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to dispel the myths of the smoke
and mirrors that are flaming up across the way with my friends.
Do they not recognize the opportunity that we have for reducing the
costs of healthcare with subsidies so that working families can get the
Affordable Care Act? Or excitingly, I am so delighted that there is a
cap on insulin. Diabetes is raging for those on Medicare, and we are
going to get those on private insurance as well.
Let's tell the truth about taxes. No taxes on those making $400,000
or less but getting the $160 billion in the top 1 percent that have
refused to pay their fair share.
What is this folder?
These are letters from my county attorneys and communities about
concrete batch facilities put in neighborhoods of Hispanics and African
Americans by Trinity Gardens in the East End and Aldine. This
legislation, $60 billion, will help save these people who have been
living in their homes and losing their homes because environmental
toxins like a concrete batch facility gets put in their neighborhood
and creates respiratory diseases: asthma, bad grass, and parks that you
can't play in.
Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation. Why?
Because it is for the working people in America.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to wholeheartedly and
enthusiastically support the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, H.R.
5376.
I commend our Democratic colleagues in the Senate--whose tireless
efforts culminated in this landmark legislation--and our Democratic
Caucus in the House, whose commitment to the policies embodied in this
legislation kept the prospect for progress alive and ready for action
over the past year.
We persevered to extend health care benefits, limit the cost of
medication, combat the climate crisis, help impoverished Americans, and
reduce inflation for all Americans. We never relinquished our focus and
determination to help those who are suffering from the economic
aftershocks of COVID-19.
Enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act is crucial at this vital
moment, as Americans need the economic relief that this bill will
provide. It will boost quality-of-life for American families by
reducing costs and inflation, and bolstering our national economy and
competitiveness for years to come.
This legislation is truly historic because it will dramatically
advance major policies and programs supported by the vast majority of
Americans, and it will do so in a fiscally responsible way, applying
much of the revenue raised to deficit reduction.
A key message that this legislation sends is that Congress, with
Democrats at the helm, is focused on providing aid to working
Americans, middle-income families, impoverished Americans, and those
who most need a little help during challenging times.
This is a stark contrast from a few years ago, when Republicans in
control of Congress passed bills that gave massive tax breaks to the
wealthiest people and corporations, and helped the rich get richer,
while tossing mere table scraps to the middle class, and barely a few
crumbs to Americans suffering in poverty.
So, I'm delighted that the Inflation Reduction Act will provide
urgently needed financial relief to Americans in need, reforms to
address the climate crisis, and initiatives that will help our nation
transition to its next era of success for all Americans.
Among the provisions that will directly benefit family finances
across the country are the Inflation Reduction Act's health care
reforms, initiatives, assistance, and restraints on cost increases.
For the first time after years of efforts by Democrats, Medicare will
be able to negotiate with drug companies to lower the price of
medications for Americans receiving Medicare. Maximum prices for 10
drugs will take effect in 2026, 15 more drugs in 2027, another 15 in
2028, and 20 more in 2029 and beyond.
Manufacturers that do not offer a price equal to or less than the
maximum fair price will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of 10
times the difference between the offered price and the maximum fair
price for all of its drugs sold in violation of that.
The IRA will impose rebates on drug companies that increase prices
faster than inflation to limit annual increases in drug prices for
people with Medicare. The inflation rebate provision will be
implemented beginning in 2023, using 2021 as the base year for
determining price changes relative to inflation.
Another major reform is a new $2,000 annual cap on Medicare Part D
out-of-pocket spending starting in 2025. Currently, there is no limit
on out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs that seniors need.
This bill ensures that devastating diagnoses, like cancer, will never
again mean paying tens of thousands out-of-pocket for just one drug,
which forces Medicare recipients into severe financial hardship.
[[Page H7652]]
The bill expands the low-income subsidy program in Medicare Part D.
Currently, it is fully available to those earning less than 135 percent
of the federal poverty level, and partially available to those earning
less than 150 percent of that level. The bill eliminates the partial
subsidy, giving those earning up to 150% of the poverty level the full
low-income subsidy in Medicare Part D.
The bill initiates a major reform to help Medicare patients who need
insulin and have been forced to pay exorbitant costs for their life-
sustaining supply.
The Inflation Reduction Act caps out-of-pocket costs at $35 per month
for insulin co-pays under Medicare programs. Cost-sharing for Part D
plans will be capped at $35 for approved insulin products starting in
2023. After 2025, the price will be the lesser of $35, 25 percent of
the maximum fair price, or 25 percent of the negotiated price. From
January to March 2023, there will be temporary subsidies for any cost
sharing over $35 per month.
While I am delighted that H.R. 5376 imposes a $35 per month cap on
the price of insulin for people covered by Medicare, this cap should
have extended to Americans with private insurance.
I was very upset that Senate Republicans rejected that policy, as it
is immoral to side with drug companies that force people to choose
between life-sustaining insulin and other daily needs. Some Americans
have died because they couldn't afford their insulin, which is subject
to unjustifiable pricing practices.
This bill should have ensured that Americans with private health
insurance would benefit from a $35 per month cap on their insulin
costs, and I will continue the fight for this reform.
The Inflation Reduction Act lowers health insurance premiums for
nearly 13 million low- and middle-income Americans whose coverage is
from the Affordable Care Act. The bill allocates $64 billion to extend
tax credits for three years, through 2025.
Recipients saved on average $800 in 2021. Monthly premiums were
estimated to decrease by $50 per person on average in 2022, and 80
percent of ACA enrollees with the tax credits were able to find a plan
that amounted to $10 or less per month.
This is extremely important because extension of these credits
subsidizing the cost of health insurance will prevent 3 million people
from becoming uninsured due to steep premium hikes, protecting them
from financial hardship, and saving the health care system from the
perilous costs of uncompensated care.
I was dismayed that Senator Warnock's amendment extending Medicaid
expansion to 2.2 million people living in poverty in 12 states was not
adopted by the Senate. Impoverished Americans with no access to
affordable health care would have been able to see a doctor when they
are sick, pregnant, or have other health needs. We must still close the
Medicaid coverage gap for Americans who have a need for, and the right
to, health care. Although it is not in this bill, I will continue to
fight for this.
The bill makes historic investments to combat climate change by
putting the United States on a path to reduce emissions by 40% by 2030,
investing $369 billion in clean energy and energy efficiency to lower
household energy costs, and ensuring that lower-income households can
benefit from these programs.
The bill's clean energy and emission reduction programs attack the
climate crisis at its source--electric utilities, cars, trucks, and
methane emission producers--while ensuring that rural and disadvantaged
communities share the benefits.
The IRA provides direct consumer incentives to relieve the high costs
of energy and decrease utility bills by encouraging purchases of energy
efficient and clean-energy goods, with a significant portion of the
funding going to lower-income households and disadvantaged communities.
The bill includes $9 billion in consumer home energy rebate programs,
focused on low-income consumers, to electrify home appliances and for
energy efficient retrofits.
The IRA provides 10 years of consumer tax credits to make homes
energy efficient, using clean energy and making heat pumps, rooftop
solar, community solar projects, electric HVAC, and efficient water
heaters more affordable.
The bill includes a $4,000 consumer tax credit for lower- and middle-
income individuals to buy used clean-energy vehicles, and up to a
$7,500 tax credit to buy new clean-energy vehicles. This will bring
electric cars--and the fuel costs they save--within the reach of
working families.
Additionally, the bill establishes a $1 billion grant program to make
affordable housing more energy efficient.
The investments in this bill will reduce emissions in every sector of
the economy, substantially reducing emissions from electricity
generation, transportation, industrial manufacturing, buildings, and
agriculture.
Tax credits are provided for clean sources of electricity and energy
storage, and roughly $30 billion in targeted grant and loan programs
for states and electric utilities to accelerate the transition to clean
electricity.
The legislation includes tax credits and grants for clean fuels and
clean commercial vehicles to reduce emissions from all parts of the
transportation sector.
The bill provides grants and tax credits to reduce emissions from
industrial manufacturing processes, including almost $6 billion for a
new Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program to reduce
emissions from the largest industrial emitters like chemical, steel and
cement plants.
To spur innovation, $27 billion is provided for a clean energy
technology accelerator to aid deployment of technologies that reduce
emissions, especially in disadvantaged communities.
The IRA has $9 billion for Federal procurement of American-made clean
products, including $3 billion for zero-emission Postal Service
vehicles, to create a stable market for them.
The Inflation Reduction Act includes over $60 billion for
environmental justice priorities to drive investments into
disadvantaged communities.
The bill has $3 billion for Environmental and Climate Justice Block
Grants that will invest in community-led projects in disadvantaged
communities and community capacity building centers to address
disproportionate environmental and public health harms related to
pollution and climate change.
The IRA creates Neighborhood Access and Equity Grants with $3 billion
to aid neighborhood equity, safety, and affordable transportation
access. This landmark program addresses a long legacy of ignoring
environmental justice concerns in project decision-making. The grants
aim to reconnect communities divided by infrastructure barriers,
mitigate negative impacts of transit facilities or construction
projects on disadvantaged or underserved communities, and support
equitable transportation planning and community engagement activities.
The bill provides another $3 billion for Grants to Reduce Air
Pollution at Ports to support the purchase and installation of zero-
emission equipment and technology at ports.
The IRA also provides $1 billion for clean heavy-duty vehicles, such
as school and transit buses and garbage trucks.
There is $60 million for Diesel Emissions Reduction Act grants to
address diesel emissions from goods movement facilities like airports
and railyards, and from vehicles using those facilities.
The IRA has $236 million for Air Pollution Monitoring that will
particularly benefit disadvantaged communities exposed to areas with
persistent air pollution.
The bill includes $50 million to address Air Pollution at Schools by
monitoring and reducing air pollution at public schools in low-income
and disadvantaged communities.
The bill provides $87 million for the Low Emissions Electricity
Program to support low-income and disadvantaged communities, and offer
technical assistance to industry, as well as state and local
governments, as they work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Environmental justice is also central to initiatives that aim to
decarbonize the economy, such as the technology accelerator and
consumer home energy rebate programs, that focus on disadvantaged and
low-income communities. Additionally, many of the clean energy tax
credits include either a bonus or set-aside structure to drive
investments and economic development in disadvantaged communities.
This bill funds energy reliability, cleaner energy, and historic
investments in American clean energy manufacturing.
It includes over $60 billion for clean energy manufacturing in the
U.S. across the full supply chain of clean energy and transportation
technologies. These manufacturing incentives will help alleviate
inflation and reduce the risk of future price shocks by bringing down
the cost of clean energy and clean vehicles and relieving supply chain
bottlenecks.
The IRA invests roughly $30 billion for production tax credits to
accelerate U.S. manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines,
batteries, and critical minerals processing.
The bill has a $10 billion investment tax credit to build clean
technology
[[Page H7653]]
manufacturing facilities, like facilities that make electric vehicles,
wind turbines and solar panels.
The bill also funds $500 million in the Defense Production Act for
heat pumps and critical minerals processing.
The bill has $2 billion in grants to retool auto manufacturing
facilities to manufacture clean vehicles, ensuring that auto
manufacturing jobs stay in the communities that rely on them.
The IRA provides up to $20 billion in loans to build new clean
vehicle manufacturing facilities across the country.
To spur the next generation of energy technologies, the bill provides
$2 billion for National Labs to accelerate breakthrough energy
research.
To afford these investments and reduce the deficit, the Inflation
Reduction Act requires the wealthiest people and corporations to pay
their fair share of taxes, without raising taxes on anyone making less
than $400,000 each year. In fact, the non-partisan Joint Committee on
Taxation reported that, in addition to not increasing taxes on any
family making $400,000 or less, taxes on those families would actually
be reduced by the IRA.
This would correct the longstanding injustice of hardworking American
families paying their taxes on time while wealthy millionaires and
billionaires avoid paying the taxes they owe to the federal government.
By creating a more equitable tax system, this bill will ease the
pressure of inflation and allow more Americans to participate
productively in the economy. Americans overwhelmingly agree that
corporations have paid too little for too long. Only in Washington
would Republicans fight against cutting costs for low- and middle-
income workers and their families in defense of wealthy corporations.
To fairly and appropriately raise revenues, the bill includes major
reforms, each of which are sound tax policies.
The Inflation Reduction Act imposes a corporate alternative minimum
tax on corporations that earn more than $1 billion in annual profit,
but do not pay at least a 15 percent tax rate. This would apply to
about 150 corporations that average nearly $9 billion in profit, but
which paid effective tax rates of just 1.1 percent. The minimum tax
will make sure they pay their fair share, and will raise approximately
$222 billion.
The bill will levy a 1 percent fee on stock buybacks by publicly-
traded corporations to level the playing field. This reform to the tax
code, which raises $74 billion, would put an end to favoring buybacks
for rich shareholders and executives over investments in workers and
innovation.
The legislation will help prevent the wealthiest Americans from
sheltering their nonbusiness income and avoiding taxes. By extending
the limitation on excess business losses for two years, the bill would
raise an additional $52 billion.
This bill also gives the IRS resources to rebuild its antiquated
systems to make the wealthy pay their taxes. By investing $80 billion
over ten years for tax enforcement and compliance, the Congressional
Budget Office estimates the IRS will collect $203 billion. Nearly 75
percent of Americans believe the IRS should conduct more tax audits of
large corporations and millionaires. Recently, the IRS Commissioner
emphasized that families making under $400,000 per year will not see
increased audits.
I was upset that the Senate did not close the carried interest
loophole, which lets investment fund managers pay lower taxes on their
earnings than wage earners pay. Billionaires scored a win worth
billions as others struggle to make ends meet. Yet, I am pleased that
the bill levels the playing field with other taxes.
The Inflation Reduction Act is excellent legislation that will be a
great leap forward for the American people, including for my
constituents in the 18th Congressional District of Texas.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that by
doubling the size of the IRS, working people in America, 85,000 more
families in the State of Texas, will face additional audits--these are
families who make less than $200,000--because of doubling of the IRS.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
Burgess).
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for
yielding.
Mr. Speaker, we are hearing that this bill is a tax cut. But that
only applies if you sign up for ObamaCare and participate in all the
green tax credits. But if you don't, then this bill is a tax increase
of over $10.5 billion for those making under $200,000 a year.
Despite what you say, there is $80 billion in this bill for 87,000
new IRS agents, and this will disproportionately increase audits on
low- and middle-income earners at a time when even the best CPA firms
cannot find qualified employees.
Now, Wednesday in the Rules Committee, I tried to get an amendment by
Mr. Davidson of Ohio made in order that would require that all of these
new hires at least be CPAs. This was rejected by every Democrat in the
Rules Committee.
Mr. Speaker, they are coming after you. They are coming after you
with poorly trained technicians, and it is just not right.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who is a distinguished member of the
Appropriations Committee.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise to support legislation that delivers
relief to every kitchen table across the country, cuts healthcare and
drug costs, and creates millions of good-paying jobs to save our planet
for future generations.
In my home State of Florida, the Inflation Reduction Act hands
security and peace of mind to millions of seniors in my State. It caps
out-of-pocket prescription costs and monthly insulin costs for Medicare
recipients, and finally allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug
prices.
Millions of Floridians will be healthier and more financially secure
by lowering premiums for 13 million Americans with expanded financial
help for the Affordable Care Act healthcare policies. It will slash
energy costs and work to stop our warming planet from stealing their
grandchildren's future.
This is our biggest shot ever to tackle climate change by speeding up
clean energy transitions and cutting climate pollution 40 percent by
2030.
The Inflation Reduction Act does all this by making corporations pay
their fair share, reducing the deficit, and ensuring no one who makes
less than $400,000 will pay one penny more.
This is game-changing relief for our seniors, our climate, and anyone
demanding tax fairness.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to pass this lifesaving
legislation.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker), who is a great leader on the Budget
Committee.
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, what a time to raise taxes and to spend
nearly $1 trillion more. The economy is in a recession, food inflation
is up 12.9 percent over the past year, gas is up 49 percent, and
shelter costs rose by 5.7 percent.
What will families get instead of relief?
They will get $10.6 billion in tax increases, and 50 percent more may
get audited by the IRS.
Now, the chairman on the other side has disputed these 87,000 new
agents. I would ask him to read page 37 of the bill which provides for
$45 billion in new funding to the IRS, specifically for enforcement
activities, and ask if he will dispute that as well.
Where does he think $45 billion is going to go?
In fact, we all know the IRS needs a lot of help to provide
constituent services. Fourteen times more dollars are going for
enforcement than to helping them do their job.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from
Pennsylvania an additional 15 seconds.
Mr. SMUCKER. Our Democrat colleagues are also falsely insisting this
bill will not raise taxes on small businesses or households with
incomes below $400,000. Yet, during Rules Committee debate on the bill,
a Ways and Means Democrat admitted that households making less than
$400,000 per year will see a tax increase in this bill. He was citing
the nonpartisan analysis from JCT.
[[Page H7654]]
Don't be fooled. This bill is not a plan to address inflation.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
I just want to clarify one thing. It seems to me that Republicans
just don't want people to pay taxes even if they are owed. We know
there are hundreds of billions of dollars of owed-but-not-paid taxes in
this country every year. This is an attempt to try and recover some of
that money that is owed and is not being paid by taxpayers who are, in
many cases, cheating.
To be clear, IRS has made no decisions or no announcements regarding
the potential hiring plans under this bill. As I said before, the
commissioner of the IRS has said that they are not going to increase
audits of people making under $400,000. A lot of this money is designed
to go to help service the legitimate and lawful taxpayers of this
country by giving them better service, making the IRS more responsive,
and to upgrading equipment which is now 50 or 60 years old in many
cases.
So they can continue with this claim that we are going to go after
taxpayers with armed IRS agents, and I know that Republicans would like
to arm every tax agent as they want to arm everybody else in this
country, but that is nonsense.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.
Khanna), who is a distinguished member of the Armed Services Committee.
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership in
passing the most historic climate legislation in the history of this
Nation and in the history of the world.
It is appropriate that it would be named after Chairman Yarmuth after
his distinguished service in this Congress.
But I also thank all the young people out there and the environmental
activists who for so long had no hope that this body would do anything.
They marched, they protested, and they organized. They deserve credit
for the $369 billion that will build solar, wind, and that will build
electric vehicles.
I understand it is only a down payment on what we need for climate. I
understand there is more work to be done, so we eliminate fossil fuel
subsidies, so we have more of a commitment to environmental justice,
and so that we don't have mandates on oil leasing. But I am so proud of
the young folks for recognizing that getting something done is better
than getting nothing done. This is the first victory in many victories
to come, and they deserve credit for our passing this bill today.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I want to point out to the
chairman of the Budget Committee that--maybe his staff has not
presented it to him--the Congressional Budget Office this morning--this
morning--confirmed that people making less than $400,000 a year will
face more audits.
You keep saying: Let the facts be real, no scare tactics.
The facts from the Congressional Budget Office are that, in fact,
your legislation is increasing more audits on people who make less than
$400,000 a year. I put it in the Record. You can read it there.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the great gentleman from Georgia
(Mr. Carter).
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the
inflation expansion act which is threatening the same industries that
it purports to help.
Washington Democrats who claim to champion electric vehicles are
pushing a bill--you are pushing this bill that will threaten an over $5
billion investment Hyundai is making in the First Congressional
District of Georgia.
Now, Mr. Speaker, this is serious. This is a $5 billion investment
that they are threatening. This will be the automaker's first dedicated
electric vehicle manufacturing plant in the United States and will
create over 8,000 jobs upon completion.
This bill's new EV tax credit discriminates against and excludes
South Korea, a key strategic trading partner and longtime ally of the
United States and may actually violate the KORUS Free Trade Agreement.
This burdensome regulation could prevent billions of dollars in
investment, thousands of jobs, and affordable electric vehicles from
coming to market in the United States.
The answer is clear: We need innovation not regulation. The private
sector is leading the charge. You are messing around with a $5 billion
investment and 8,000 jobs, Mr. Speaker. I hope that you will let my
colleagues know, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. Green), who is the distinguished member of the Financial
Services Committee.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, to my friends across the aisle:
Where were you when your twice impeached President was putting billions
of dollars in the pockets of the wealthy?
You complain about drug prices being reduced for seniors, complain
about them having out-of-pocket costs capped at $2,000?
I refuse to allow a bill that is good to be defeated by a perfect
bill that we won't get. I will support this bill, and I ask my
colleagues to do so as well. It is time to take care of our seniors.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are again reminded to direct their
remarks to the Chair.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the great
gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Guest).
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this
destructive piece of legislation.
Every day I hear from fellow Mississippians who struggle to buy gas
and groceries because of inflation fueled by the left's reckless
spending.
Now, instead of acknowledging the impact their out-of-control
spending has had on Americans, my colleagues across the aisle are
trying to pass legislation that will increase taxes on Americans, spend
hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars on far-left priorities, and
pass legislation that will add an army of IRS agents.
It is time to acknowledge that the American people are suffering
because of legislation exactly like this.
The American people are tired of this economic crisis, and they have
been clear: Do not raise taxes, do not add to this recession with more
wasteful spending, do not weaponize the IRS, and do not vote for this
legislation.
This Congress must listen to the American people and vote against
this bill.
{time}  1245
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), a distinguished member of the Appropriations
Committee.
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, global inflation caused by our reopening due
to COVID-19 has caused increased prices in everything from gasoline to
groceries to healthcare.
Today, we put people over politics as we lessen the impact of global
inflation on the American people via the Inflation Reduction Act.
Among the many things it does, it addresses some of the drivers of
higher energy costs while also investing in U.S.-based renewable energy
that will make us more energy independent and less dirty.
It finally allows us to negotiate lower prescription drug prices
through volume purchasing via Medicare while capping out-of-pocket drug
expenses for seniors to no more than $2,000 per year.
We make these big investments by ensuring that corporations that have
often gamed the system pay a minimal share of taxes and go after
wealthy tax cheats who, all too often, have evaded their
responsibilities.
I will gladly vote for this bill today. It is time to stand up to Big
Pharma and those energy companies making record profits while making
our planet less safe, and it is important we make sure that
corporations pay their fair share of taxes to reduce the burden on
working families.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack), my good friend.
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the
inflation expansion act.
It feels a little bit like Groundhog Day here on Capitol Hill because
it wasn't but about a year ago that we found ourselves debating almost
this very same legislation. It was a bad idea then; it is a bad idea
now. Even Bernie Sanders isn't buying this bill and has said that it
won't do much to reduce inflation.
The only difference here really is the price tag from a year ago--
$745 billion in new spending. That is not cheap. Do you know what we
could do with that?
You could give every single working mom in America a check for
$96,000.
You could give hardworking American seniors, who are, many of them,
[[Page H7655]]
now retired and having to go back to work, and they are on fixed
incomes, you could give them $14,000.
You could give every homeless veteran in America a check for $5.6
million with this bill.
Instead, we are going to double the size of the IRS and target
hardworking families who make $400,000 or less. We know it to be a
fact. Stop denying it. The Senate Democrats refused and rejected the
amendment that would have protected families making $400,000 or less.
Reject this bill. Put Americans first. It is time to vote hell no.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. Allred), a distinguished member of the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee.
Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Inflation
Reduction Act.
For too long, Congress has refused to act while seniors like my mom,
who is a breast cancer survivor, endured price gouging on their
medicines while on Medicare.
Today, Democrats in Congress are changing that. We are going to stand
up to Big Pharma and let Medicare negotiate lower prices and cap out-
of-pocket costs at $2,000, as well as capping the cost of insulin.
For too long, Congress has refused to address the climate crisis and
invest in clean energy. Today, Democrats in Congress are changing that.
Through the largest-ever investment to fight climate change, this bill
will cut emissions by 40 percent by 2030. It unleashes American and,
yes, Texas-made clean energy while creating 9 million jobs.
Thanks to President Biden, and Democrats in Congress, this historic
legislation will impact our Nation for generations to come, all while
reducing the deficit without raising taxes on folks making less than
$400,000 a year.
It is a big deal, and I cannot wait to vote ``yes'' for it. I
encourage my colleagues to do the same.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), my good friend.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
yielding.
Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. Everybody in this Chamber supports
lowering prescription drug costs, lowering these outrageous costs that
all of our constituents are paying across the country. We all support
clean, affordable energy and access to those resources. We all support
lowering inflation.
The difference is, where the credibility gap exists, is that the very
problems, the very crisis that our country is experiencing today, were
actually caused by the Biden administration's policies.
We went from, in my hometown, $1.80 a gallon for gasoline to,
recently, I paid $4.20. We have seen a tripling of natural gas costs.
Their own policies have caused this.
Nearly a quarter of all Americans today can't even afford to pay
their electricity bills. The Biden administration policies have caused
record inflation, making Americans unable to even afford grocery costs.
The Biden administration policies have resulted in higher emissions,
not lower emissions, as compared to the previous administration. Biden
administration policies resulted in this President going to countries
like Saudi Arabia and asking them for energy while telling Americans
that we can't produce.
Mr. Speaker, I can't help but reminisce over Jack Abramoff, a
disgraced lobbyist, convicted, who created problems and then charged
clients to fix them. The difference between this bill and Jack Abramoff
is that Jack Abramoff actually fixed problems for his clients.
This bill is a disaster. There is a credibility gap. They have caused
problems, and now we are being asked to trust them to fix them, and we
simply can't. Oppose this legislation.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Louisiana (Mr. Carter), a distinguished member of the Transportation
and Infrastructure Committee.
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, far too many things in life
just aren't fair. However, one thing should, frankly, always be fair,
and that is taxes.
What should always be fair is access to insulin, access to clean
energy, and relief from the raging energy costs that we see across our
country.
This historic Inflation Reduction Act is fully paid for by requiring
the biggest corporations and the ultrawealthy to pay their fair share.
It does so without any new taxes on small businesses or those making
under $400,000. I said ``$400,000.''
We can achieve this goal by strengthening IRS enforcement against
wealthy tax cheats and closing tax loopholes exploited by the
wealthiest few, 150 massive corporations.
In opposing these provisions, my Republican colleagues are, sadly,
aligning themselves with megacorporations and the ultrawealthy and
turning their backs on the American people.
I am proud that, with this bill, Democrats are once again putting
people over politics, fighting for the American people. I urge full
support for this measure.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record analysis
from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which confirms that
the bill increases taxes by $10.6 billion on individuals making under
$200,000 in 2023 and increases taxes by $32.6 billion across all
incomes.

\1 \The analysis does not include the effects of the policy

spending under Subtitle C estimated by Congressional Budget
Office.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the good
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, the American people are sick and tired of
runaway government promises of how excessive spending, tax increases,
and Green New Deal special interest investments are somehow going to
make their lives better and reduce inflation.
Yet, we are here today in this Chamber to raise taxes on the American
people, hire 87,000 new IRS auditors forever more, Mr. Speaker, and
pass over a half trillion dollars in new government spending, all in
the name of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Mr. Speaker, is this some sort of joke? Do we actually think that the
American people believe that? Well, they don't.
By the way, regarding the $400,000 less won't get taxed, if a pass-
through business makes $400K and the partners pay themselves $100,000
each, they will fall under the audit initiative by the IRS.
As well, the projections for IRS hiring do not count only taxing
those over $400K, so the whole thing was made up to make it sound
better than it is.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman
from Nevada (Mr. Horsford), a distinguished member of the Budget
Committee.
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I will cast my vote today to lower the
cost of prescription drugs, tackle the climate crisis, and make big
corporations pay their fair share in taxes while putting people over
politics.
Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle love to
rant about fiscal responsibility, but the facts are clear: Every time a
Republican President and congressional majority collude for their
corporate friends and the rich elite, our deficits soar. So, it is up
to Democrats to clean up that mess.
This Inflation Reduction Act is a historic downpayment on deficit
reduction of approximately $300 billion to fight inflation.
For years, Nevadans have seen their cost of living rise, while my
Republican colleagues across the aisle have focused on giving away tax
cuts for the wealthy. Well, today, we vote for seniors, in my district
and across America, who want one thing from Congress right now, and
that is to lower prescription drug prices.
Today, we will cast our votes to pass the Inflation Reduction Act
because it includes an important provision to cap out-of-pocket drug
costs at $2,000 per senior and to cap insulin costs at $35 a month for
seniors and individuals with disabilities.
Finally, the Inflation Reduction Act includes a historic step to
combat the climate crisis, including $4 billion to States like Nevada
to combat the effects of the two-decades-long Western drought.
Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to pass this legislation for the
people, putting people over politics.
[[Page H7658]]
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out to the
gentleman from Nevada that since Joe Biden has taken the oath of
office, his reckless spending has led to an inflation crisis that has
cost his families in Nevada $9,700 per family.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the great gentleman from Ohio (Mr.
Carey).
Mr. CAREY. Mr. Speaker, Americans are in the midst of a recession and
the worst inflation in over 40 years, yet my friends across the aisle
are set to pass a $745 billion spending bill that will raise taxes,
fund the Green New Deal initiatives, and hire 87,000 IRS agents to
target Americans--all this while doing nothing to reduce inflation and
adding over $146 billion in debt.
Now, they say it won't raise taxes on people making less than
$400,000, but the Joint Committee on Taxation has said at least half of
all new tax revenue raised will come from those earning under $400,000.
Probably the biggest thing for me is the 87,000 new IRS agents. To
folks back in Ohio, I just want to put this in a way that you can
understand. That is 10,000 more people than live in the city of Parma.
That is 17,000 more people that live in the city of Canton, 23,000 more
than in Youngstown.
This is not the Inflation Reduction Act. This is the audit America
act.
{time}  1300
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I want to respond one more time to these
claims about 87,000 new IRS agents. The IRS has never made any
announcement about plans to hire any number of agents. The Washington
Post fact-checker has actually given that claim three Pinocchios.
Again, these are Republicans making it up to scare the American people.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.
Spanberger), a distinguished member of the Committee on Agriculture.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, today, I am so proud to rise in support
of the Inflation Reduction Act.
As chair of the Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry, I am
excited that this bill includes dedicated funding to further the role
of Virginia's crop and livestock producers in our work to protect our
planet.
Farmers are the original conservationists, and their expertise cannot
be ignored if we are going to meet our shared climate goals while also
bringing greater investments to rural America, strengthening our
farmers' bottom lines, and lowering the cost of inputs.
We can make investments in our Nation's producers by investing in
existing voluntary conservation programs at USDA, and that is what this
legislation does.
I am proud that the conservation provisions in this bill reflect
multiple pieces of legislation that I have championed to make possible,
including my bipartisan REAP Improvement Act.
These provisions include stronger investments in the Rural Energy for
America Program, or REAP, and support our conservation workforce and
our Natural Resources Conservation Service. These are smart investments
for the bottom lines of our farmers.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. Jones), a distinguished member of the Committee on the
Judiciary.
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to be standing here today in
this Chamber as we make history for the American people.
Democrats fought so hard for so long to get to this moment. Even when
faced with what many described as insurmountable odds, we kept at it.
We never gave up. We never relented in our advocacy. We said we wanted
to get back to the negotiating table and that we wanted to start with
climate.
Now, we will make the biggest climate investment this Nation has ever
seen, while creating millions of good-paying jobs. The stakes of the
climate crisis could not be higher, especially for low-income
communities and communities of color around the country, who are always
the hardest hit.
This legislation is also for my grandmother, Alice Jones, who worked
well past the age of retirement just to pay for the high cost of
prescription drugs and medical procedures not fully covered by
Medicare, as we know. Today, we will also lower prescription drug
prices for our seniors.
This is why I ran for Congress. This is government working for the
people. This is Democrats delivering on our promises.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from California (Mr. Obernolte).
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, new data from the Department of Labor
released this week indicates that inflation in America remains at a 40-
year high.
Numerous studies, including one by the San Francisco branch of our
Federal Reserve Bank, indicate that the reason why Americans
disproportionately are suffering from this inflation is reckless levels
of deficit spending by our Federal Government.
Only the United States Congress could respond to the situation with a
bill that increases Federal spending by over $700 billion at the same
time it increases taxes on Americans.
To add insult to injury, our own Congressional Budget Office, as well
as the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business, and
hundreds of economists, tell us that this bill, the so-called Inflation
Reduction Act, will not actually reduce inflation at all.
We need to get our fiscal house in order and solve the reckless
spending that is causing this inflation instead of taking action that
makes the situation even worse. I urge a ``no'' vote.
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. Ross), a distinguished member of the Committee on
the Judiciary.
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise to support the Inflation Reduction
Act.
This bill is a monumental achievement that will move America forward,
making important advances in everything from healthcare costs to energy
prices to tax fairness.
Coming from North Carolina, a State battered with increasing
regularity by catastrophic storms, I am especially proud that this act
represents the most significant investment to combat climate change in
U.S. history.
I am also pleased that this bill includes a measure that I have
championed, which will end the prior moratorium on offshore wind. The
Trump administration basically banned North Carolina from taking
advantage of industrial-scale offshore wind. Our utilities support it,
it is good for our economy, and it is good for our environment. This is
an important, game-changing bill.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde), who definitely has experience with
the IRS.
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, despite the White House's politically
motivated propaganda that claims our economy is in a transition with
zero percent inflation, the reality is we are facing an economic
recession and continue to battle 40-year high inflation.
As millions of Americans struggle to buy groceries, fill up their gas
tanks, afford rent, and pay utility bills, Democrats are ramming
through their tax-and-spend bill that will only make life worse.
Now, I know the left can't quite grasp the basics of high school
biology, but it appears that they also need a lesson on the
fundamentals of economics and basic math.
But I don't think they are interested in their much-needed schooling
because their actions are intentional. Time and time again, the left
proves their priorities lie with Big Government socialism, not the
American people. Through increased IRS audits, they are willing to
demolish any small business, worker, or family that gets in their way.
Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to reject fueling inflation
and reject tax hikes during a recession by voting ``no'' on Democrats'
build back broke bill.
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, my Democratic colleagues own this bill. Let's
be clear:
Tax increases for the average American, check.
$80 billion to the Internal Revenue Service to go after those
Americans, to hire agents, jobs already posted, check.
[[Page H7659]]
Increased electricity prices, increased gas prices, tilted windmills
with your unicorn energy policies, check.
Increased government and corporate control of healthcare, check.
I hear my colleagues talking about, ``Oh, we are going to go after
pharma.'' Well, what did the CDC say yesterday?
Don't worry about all of those mandates, don't worry about all of
those vaccines, and don't worry about all the quarantines. Sorry, pox
on us.
But my colleagues now today are going to dump hundreds of billions of
dollars into corporate America, screwing over the American people every
single day with tax audits, increased energy prices, and increased
taxes.
Congratulations. Take that to the polls.
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much
time is remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Underwood). The gentleman from Missouri
has 1 minute remaining.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
The solution to the inflation crisis that the Democrats have set
forward is to spend hundreds of billions of more dollars and to tax all
hardworking Americans once again.
You cannot spend your way out of inflation, and you cannot tax your
way out of recession. But that is the recipe that the one-party,
Democrat rule in Washington, D.C., has suggested for the hardworking
Americans who are barely surviving to put food on their table, clothes
on their backs, and gasoline in their cars.
I will point out to the chairman that his President's budget outlined
an additional $80 billion for the IRS. Highlighted in that budget he
wanted 87,000 IRS agents. That is where the number is coming from, from
your President, who provided a budget.
I know in the Budget Committee, we have never had a hearing on budget
for the last 3\1/2\ years. That is probably why you didn't know 87,000
auditors were in the President's budget.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, I want to remind my Republican colleagues and the
American people, once again, what Republicans will be voting against
today.
They will be voting against cutting prescription drug prices for
their constituents. They will be voting against combating inflation and
lowering energy costs. They will be voting against the largest Federal
investment in dealing with climate crisis in the history of this
country.
I cannot believe that I still heard from the other side today the
hoax comment, that climate change is a hoax. You would think that as we
watch what is going on in the world, while I watch what is going on in
my State, when my citizens in eastern Kentucky were devastated by
historic floods, when my citizens in western Kentucky were devastated
by historic tornadoes, all of which scientists have said were
exacerbated by climate change, that there are still people who deny
that climate change exists.
But for the first time in this country, we will show true leadership
to the world, that we are taking action, and we are going to lead the
world in combating climate change.
The gentleman from Texas said Democrats own this bill. Yes, we do.
Proud of it. I don't know one member of the Democratic Caucus who is
not thrilled to death today that we are doing what we are doing,
because the vast majority of the American people support what we are
doing. The vast majority of the American people want us to cap out-of-
pocket expenses for seniors for their medications at $2,000.
Republicans say no. They are going to vote against that. They are
going to vote against a cap of a $35 copay for insulin. Tens of
millions of Americans will benefit from that.
We know that five former Secretaries of the Treasury from both
Democratic and Republican administrations, 126 of our Nation's top
economists, including seven Nobel Laureates, support the Inflation
Reduction Act.
On other side, we have Big Pharma, corporate lobbyists, tax cheats,
and congressional Republicans.
This debate has made clearer than ever that Democrats are working to
make life better for the American people while Republicans just don't
care. It is as simple as it is harsh.
This legislation is important, historic, and a significant win for
American families and for the planet.
I will be voting ``yes'' on the Inflation Reduction Act, and soon we
will be sending it to President Biden's desk to be signed into law. I
know he will be proud to do that as well.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal)
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) each will control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
As we begin the proceeding here on the Ways and Means portion of the
legislation, I want to begin by calling attention to the untimely and
tragic loss of our colleague, Jackie Walorski, and two members of her
staff.
Jackie was a force on the committee, as well as the ranking member of
the Subcommittee on Worker and Family Support. She led with deep
commitment to children and families and was well regarded as a member
of the community, a real humanitarian.
You couldn't miss her bright smile or her booming laugh. She embodied
what it meant to serve.
When she called me ``Mr. Chairman,'' as she always did in the
hallway, loudly, with a booming voice, I know she meant it.
We were all lucky to have had her as a colleague and even luckier to
be able to call her a friend.
The families and loved ones of Congresswoman Walorski, Emma Thomson,
and Zachery Potts remain in our thoughts and prayers. May they rest in
peace, as valued Members of the Ways and Means family.
Madam Speaker, I rise in full support of the Inflation Reduction Act.
I look forward, as I have in the past, to this moment, reciting the
wisdom that is often referenced by me, because the words come from
another son of Massachusetts, Mr. Webster.
Over the Speaker's rostrum that adorns this marvelous institution,
which I love, the quote is simple: ``Let us develop the resources of
our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, and promote
all its great interests and see whether we also in our day and
generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.''
The Inflation Reduction Act is something worthy of being remembered.
This is substantive and transformative legislation, a reminder to all
that in the legislative life and its rhythms, we generally pursue
perfection but accept the possible. Part of that is what we are marking
at this moment.
This is a historic win for family pocketbooks, for Americans' health,
and for the future of climate security. We fund these gains by ensuring
that large, profitable companies pay their fair share, just like all
members of the American family are asked to do.
{time}  1315
The Inflation Reduction Act will lower costs. For the first time,
Medicare will negotiate drug prices, and there will be a cap on what
comes out of seniors' pockets for their lifesaving prescriptions. No
more rationing or forgoing necessary medicines.
We are lowering healthcare costs for millions of low-income and
middle-income Americans by extending the Affordable Care Act's premium
tax credit enhancements through 2025.
Let me give you a statistic that is compelling. Madam Speaker, 100
percent of the children in Massachusetts have health insurance, and 97
percent of the adults in Massachusetts have health insurance. It polls
extraordinarily well in terms of its success ratios because we
decided--labor, business, Democrat, and Republican--to make it work,
and we did.
These enhanced premium credits, first enacted by the American Rescue
Plan, have made way for record-low uninsured rates that have put
hundreds of dollars back into the pockets of low- and middle-income
Americans.
This legislation will also make the largest investment in tackling
climate
[[Page H7660]]
change that our Nation has ever witnessed. The investments in clean
energy, energy efficiency, and clean manufacturing will generate 9
million good-paying jobs.
These historic wins are achieved with sensible and responsible
multiyear investments in the IRS.
I have been a member of the Ways and Means Committee, Madam Speaker,
for 30 years. Let me give our friends an interesting statistic about
the American family. We have the highest voluntary compliance rate in
the world. Eighty-six percent of the American people pay their taxes.
This idea that we are creating 87,000 armed representatives of the
Federal Government to go out and harass the American people is
nonsensical. Retirements alone are going to require a substantive
investment. The IRS has fewer than 20 percent of the employees that it
once did.
What is important to remember here is this: We want to make sure with
this investment in the IRS that we continue to have a high voluntary
compliance rate and also to invest in the necessary technology that
will allow the modeling to make sure compliance remains with us, as
well.
These are historical investments and achievements, and they also are
going to continue our quest on the Democratic side here for an element
of tax fairness that will hold people at the very top as responsible as
the other side likes to hold people who receive the EITC tax credit in
terms of their request for audits. We do this simply by asking the most
powerful among us to pay their fair share. This is what a full and fair
tax administration is about.
The American people have been through an unthinkable hardship over
the last 2\1/2\ years, but they entrusted Joe Biden and congressional
Democrats to keep them safe and to rebuild our economy.
Here is a fact: On March 11, 2020, Dr. Fauci gave his warning. He
warned us of what was coming. In April 2020, America had lost 22
million jobs. Here we are, 2 years later, in the Biden administration,
and every job has been returned. There are 10.6 million jobs that go
unanswered right now in the American economy.
We have bounced back faster than we imagined. Not only have all these
jobs been returned, but for 51 straight days, gasoline prices have
fallen.
That is an issue about supply and demand, by the way. It is about
international events, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and
supply chains across the world. Those chains that I have just
referenced have been shored up, and retailers are starting to
realistically address some speculation as it relates to price.
Democrats shouldn't be asked to do this alone, but we are being asked
to do it today alone.
We are going to hear a lot of Washington talk from folks on the other
side that want to address the politics of the situation rather than cap
the cost of insulin for their constituents. They want to protect the
pocketbooks of those who would raise prescription drug prices
unnecessarily and cut costs for workers and their families, which we
intend to do.
You are going to hear a lot of spin on this bill that has received a
lot of endorsements, even from bipartisan former Treasury Secretaries,
but that is because the opponents are out of options.
The Inflation Reduction Act sets our Nation on a healthier, fairer,
and more prosperous path. We have heard the calls of the American
people, and with the Inflation Reduction Act, we continue to win this
moment for them in its totality.
Madam Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I join Chairman Neal in expressing our heartbreak and
sorrow in losing Congresswoman Jackie Walorski, our colleague, as well
as Zachery and Emma. She was so proud of her Team Walorski folks.
The truth of the matter is, Jackie lit up every room she was in with
her passion and her brilliance and her friendship and warmness. There
is no question she could do everything. She was all in on everything
and worked hard to find common ground wherever she could.
Last week was a shocking week and a week to mourn. This week is a
time to celebrate Jackie, her legacy, and her life.
Sadly, this massive Senate bill, drawn in secret, stuffed with
government checks to the wealthy and favored interests, and rushed
through Congress is a hoax on the American people. It fails to reduce
inflation, fails to reduce the budget deficit, and fails to reduce the
world's temperature.
Who in their right mind raises taxes in a recession? The answer is
only President Biden and his supporters in Congress who bungled this
economic recovery think that is a good idea. You remember them. They
told you they would defeat COVID, that inflation was a rich person's
problem, that their $2 trillion spending spree last spring would
strengthen the economy.
Instead, what did their promises deliver? The worst inflation in 40
years, a recession, and a crippling worker shortage that continues to
hammer Main Street businesses.
Today, we have a shrinking economy, shrinking paychecks, and a
shrinking workforce. Families are skipping meals, running up credit
card debt to pay for daily essentials, delaying retirement, and
struggling to afford gas just to drive to work. Yet, Democrats today
insist inflation doesn't even exist. They say it is zero.
The truth is, most Americans have lost confidence in President
Biden's failed handling of the economy. By contrast, the majority of
the jobs in the COVID recovery came under President Trump, and under
Republican leadership, paychecks grew twice as fast as prices. The
economy was surging, not shrinking like it is today, and 600,000 more
Americans were working than today under this unpopular White House.
Why would you trust the same Democrats responsible for this cruel
economy with another of their misguided spending bills?
While other countries are lowering taxes to fight inflation,
Democrats imposed over $350 billion in taxes that land on local
manufacturers that build right here in America. It will kill jobs, slow
the economy, and raise prices even higher.
Small businesses, which hire nearly half of all workers in America,
get hammered with $50 billion in new taxes.
Senior citizens and savers will bear the impact of $74 billion in new
taxes that punish companies from investing in their stock value.
All these taxes will hurt the economy, drive inflation further, and
harm workers' paychecks, according to the independent Tax Foundation.
Democrats promise that no American will ``see a penny'' of tax hikes,
yet Congress' own budget office debunks that claim, confirming the
largest burden of higher taxes will come from middle-class families
starting next year.
President Biden is violating his own pledge not to raise taxes on
middle-class Americans. He is denying that truth.
Yesterday, House Democrats insisted there are no new IRS agents
funded in this bill. Read their lips: No new IRS agents. They say it is
all fearmongering, and they are just hiring replacements.
Unfortunately, the fact is the IRS budget already budgets for those
who are leaving through attrition, and the Treasury Department itself
outlines the next decade of adding 87,000 new IRS agents. That is what
this bill unleashes.
In fact, the Congressional Budget Office reports ``audit rates will
increase for every income level,'' that almost 90 percent of unreported
tax income comes from who? The middle class.
How will Democrats collect $204 billion in more taxes? With thousands
of new agents targeting what I would call Walmart shoppers. You know
them. They are real, hardworking American families. They are my
constituents. They are my neighbors in my district. They are living
paycheck to paycheck, struggling with inflation and higher gas prices.
They will be hit with over 700,000 new audits, thanks to a skyrocketing
surge in IRS agents.
Maybe that is why Democrats blocked any language in the Senate that
protects Walmart shoppers and other value-shopping families against
[[Page H7661]]
these new IRS audits. But, man, this bill, they love the wealthy. If
the Green New Deal and corporate welfare had a baby, it would look like
this. Nearly one-quarter of a trillion dollars in Green New Deal
subsidies, government handouts, go to the wealthy and to the biggest,
most successful businesses in America.
Look at this: A single working mom will pay higher taxes so they can
be sent in a government check to wealthy investors and massive
corporations. A yardman will send his taxes in a government check to
the very well-to-do family whose lawn he is cutting so they can splurge
on an $80,000 luxury electric vehicle.
Incredibly, to fund all these government handouts, every Senate
Democrat and the Vice President chose to impose higher taxes on small
businesses so that millionaires and billionaires would be protected
from higher State and local taxes.
Everyone facing devastating diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, ALS,
and Parkinson's will pay a deadly price.
This crazy bill increases the cost of healthcare and medicines and
kills new lifesaving cures while providing ObamaCare subsidies for the
wealthy and those choosing not to return to work, making the worker
shortage harsher.
Congress' nonpartisan scorekeeper, the Penn Wharton School of
Business, and the University of Chicago all confirm the government
price-fixing scheme could be a death sentence for patients, raising the
costs of new drugs, crushing innovation, and killing hundreds of cures.
Higher taxes, harassing IRS audits on our Walmart shoppers, no relief
from inflation, all as America battles a recession.
Let me ask again: Do you really trust the same President and
Democrats who drove this economy into recession and drove prices sky
high with yet another spending spree?
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this
bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the very
accomplished gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson).
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I start by echoing the
sentiments that both the chairman and the ranking member had about
Jackie Walorski and how deeply we all feel for her and her family and
the staff members who were lost.
I congratulate Mr. Neal and also members of this committee, most
notably Mr. Thompson and Mr. Blumenauer, as well, for their work on
climate change and for their work throughout this period of putting
forward consequential legislation. I say ``consequential'' in the time
I am allotted because I want to talk and focus specifically on some of
these claims.
I hope the American people are listening. You don't bring about
change by appealing to the sum total of the fears of the American
people. You bring about change aspirationally and by doing something
constructive and putting forward legislation as opposed to putting
forward the collective fears of a nation and hoping that you might be
able to exploit those fears for political gain.
The myth that there are 87,000 IRS agents, even Trump's former person
rejects that. It is nonsense, as Mr. Neal has pointed out.
What matters to people is when you help them directly, like Rod
Yearwood in West Hartford, Connecticut, who is paying $1,400 a month
for his insurance, but now, under this bill, is paying $20 a month. The
real savings he gets from that allows him to provide for a college
education for his children. Aspiration.
{time}  1330
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record Page 16 of the
Department of the Treasury's tax compliance plan, which shows the
agency intends to hire 87,000 new IRS employees.
Restoring IRS Resources
The first step in the President's efforts to restore IRS
enforcement capability is a sustained, multi-year commitment
to rebuilding the IRS. This involves spending nearly $80
billion on IRS priorities over the course of the decade
including hiring new specialized enforcement staff,
modernizing antiquated information technology, and investing
in meaningful taxpayer service--including the implementation
of the newly expanded credits aimed at providing support to
American families. Importantly, the additional resources will
go toward enforcement against those with the highest incomes,
and audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for
those earning less than $400,000 in actual income.
The President's proposal includes two components: a
dedicated stream of mandatory funds ($72.5 billion over a
decade) and a program integrity allocation ($6.7 billion over
a decade). These mechanisms provide for a sustained, multi-
year commitment to revitalizing the IRS that will give the
agency the certainty it needs to rebuild.
The IRS proposal includes year-by-year estimates of the
additional resources that will be directed toward the agency
as well as the specific activities that these resources would
support. The design ensures that the IRS is able to absorb
and usefully deploy additional resources over the entire 10-
year horizon and keeps budget growth manageable at around 10
percent per year.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Oklahoma (Mr. Hern).
Mr. HERN. I rise today in strong opposition to the bill before us
today.
Never in our history has the Federal Government responded to a
recession by raising taxes on Americans. It is simply unthinkable.
Nearly everything our colleagues across the aisle have said about
this bill has been proven false. I have noticed they have stopped
calling it the inflation legislation because they know it is not true.
They are hailing it as a climate and tax plan. I will give them that
because this legislation will raise American taxes and give that money
to handpicked socialist green companies. I wouldn't be proud of that if
I were them.
What this bill will absolutely do is not reduce inflation. In fact,
even liberal economists are warning it will do the exact opposite.
Just today, 56 percent of Democrats and 91 percent of Independents
are now gravely concerned with the direction of our economy. I have
received thousands of phone calls, text messages, and emails from my
constituents over the last week pleading with me to stop this bill from
passing. They understand what half of this Chamber does not.
When the Federal Government spends more, American families have less.
I find nothing redeemable in this legislation and, therefore, I urge my
colleagues to vote a resounding ``no.''
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from
Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), who has had a profound influence on the
renewable energy part of this legislation.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I appreciate
his leadership and his courtesy.
Madam Speaker, this legislative package is something that refuses to
die. It will reduce inflation, lower energy costs, and lower the cost
of prescription drugs. But it is not just about inflation, it is about
addressing the climate crisis and the crisis of confidence in
government.
Last week, President Biden met with some of the foremost experts on
the Presidency and American democracy to better understand the critical
state that we are now in with the future of our democracy and how we
avoid its destruction.
We have our moment of making American history now. It is our moment
for the future of our planet, for our children and grandchildren, and
ourselves.
I am pleased to have worked for over a decade on these provisions
dealing with green energy, investment tax credits, energy efficiency in
commercial buildings, and legislation to make polluters pay by
reinstating the Superfund tax.
Seniors and working families will see significant savings by allowing
Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capping the monthly cost of
prescriptions, something the Republicans made illegal in 2004.
And critically, it takes steps to restore the ability of the IRS to
function, closing the $400 billion tax gap and not making the American
public pay for poor customer service because of their mindless attack
on this important institution.
Because the Inflation Reduction Act represents more than the sum of
these individual provisions, it is proof that our system works and that
the United States has the capacity to solve our most pressing
challenges in the years ahead just when we need it most.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a CBO letter,
[[Page H7662]]
which confirms the Affordable Care Act subsidies will boost inflation
and reduce the incentive for people to work.
U.S. Congress,
Congressional Budget Office,
Washington, DC, August 4, 2022.
Re Economic Analysis of Budget Reconciliation Legislation
Hon. Lindsey Graham,
Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
Dear Senator: Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office
published a cost estimate for H.R. 5376, the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022, which is the latest version of the
reconciliation legislation in the Senate.\1\ This letter
provides answers to four questions you asked related to that
bill and broader economic conditions.
Is the United States Currently in a Recession?
The U.S. economy shows signs of slowing, but whether the
economy is currently in a recession is difficult to say. It
is possible that, in retrospect, it will become apparent that
the economy moved into recession sometime this year. However,
that is not clear from data that were available at the
beginning of August. Some key metrics indicate a decline in
economic activity as the first half of this year progressed,
whereas others indicate continued growth, though generally at
a slower rate than previously.
Real gross domestic product (that is, GDP adjusted to
remove the effects of inflation) and industrial production
have both declined. In particular, real GDP declined by an
average of 1.25 percent (at an annual rate) in the first two
quarters of 2022. Industrial production grew from January to
April, was essentially unchanged in May, and then declined in
June.
Other key indicators of economic activity have continued to
increase in the first half of 2022, though generally at a
slower rate than they had previously. For instance, real
gross domestic income (GDI) increased at an annual rate of
1.8 percent in the first quarter of 2022 after growing by an
average rate of 6.3 percent in the second half of 2021.\2\
(Second-quarter data for GDI are not yet available.) Real
personal income minus transfer payments to people by federal,
state, and local governments grew at an average annual rate
of 0.5 percent in the first half of 2022 versus 3.1 percent
in the second half of 2021. And real personal consumption
expenditures grew at an average annual rate of 1.4 percent in
the first half of 2022 (with somewhat slower growth in the
second quarter than in the first), compared with 2.2 percent
in the second half of 2021. One reason for the deceleration
in personal consumption expenditures is higher inflation,
which has eroded consumers' purchasing power. Another reason
is that real disposable personal income has declined in the
first half of 2022. Savings accumulated during the
coronavirus pandemic, including from transfer payments, have
continued to support consumption.
The labor market remains tight, with low unemployment and
elevated job vacancies, but both measures have softened in
recent months. Net gains in nonfarm payroll employment
averaged 375,000 jobs per month in the second quarter of 2022
compared with 539,000 jobs, on net, added per month in the
first quarter and 590,000 jobs, on net, added per month in
the second half of 2021. In June 2022, the unemployment rate
was 3.6 percent (unchanged since March and near its
prepandemic low) and there were about 1.8 job vacancies for
every unemployed worker (one of the highest readings in the
near 22-year history of this series though down from its
highest level of 2.0 in March).
How Would Enacting the Bill Affect Inflation in 2022 and 2023?
In calendar year 2022, enacting the bill would have a
negligible effect on inflation, in CBO's assessment. In
calendar year 2023, inflation would probably be between 0.1
percentage point lower and 0.1 percentage point higher under
the bill than it would be under current law, CBO estimates.
That range of likely outcomes reflects uncertainty about how
various provisions of the bill would affect overall demand
and output, the supply of labor, the persistence of
disruptions in the supply of goods and services, and how the
Federal Reserve would respond to offset any increase in
inflationary pressure. Responsiveness to the enhancement of
health insurance subsidies established by the Affordable Care
Act is the most important factor boosting inflationary
pressure, and responsiveness to the new alternative minimum
tax on corporations is the most important factor reducing
inflationary pressure. The range applies to multiple measures
of inflation: the GDP price index, the personal consumption
expenditures price index, and the consumer price index for
all urban consumers.
In its analysis of the inflationary effects of the bill,
CBO used an approach similar to that underlying the agency's
estimates of the short-term effects of legislation enacted in
2021.\3\ The agency augmented its analysis to account for the
effects of supply disruptions and for the amount of tightness
or slack in the economy on the inflationary effects of fiscal
policy.
Key inputs into the analysis of inflation were the effects
of the bill on overall demand for goods and services. In the
short term, changes in fiscal policies affect the economy
primarily by influencing the demand for goods and services by
consumers, businesses, and governments, which leads to
changes in output. Factors increasing overall demand push
inflation up and those decreasing overall demand push
inflation down. To estimate the effects of changes in federal
spending and revenues on overall demand and output, CBO
considered evidence about the effects of similar policies in
the past and used results produced by macroeconomic
models.\4\
CBO expects different provisions of the legislation to
affect overall demand and output differently.\5\ For example,
provisions that directly increase government purchases of
goods and services would add to overall demand on a dollar-
for-dollar basis. Increases in financial support to people,
such as through enhanced health insurance subsidies, would
boost spending more among lower-income people than among
higher-income people, partly because lower-income households
typically consume a higher fraction of their additional
disposable income than higher-income households do. Thus,
financial assistance to lower-income households would boost
the overall demand for goods and services more than financial
assistance to higher-income households would. Changes to
business taxes that affect after-tax profits on past
investments--as opposed to the return on new investments--
would have relatively small effects on overall demand, in
CBO's assessment.
CBO used its estimates of the bill's net effects on the
deficit as the starting point for its analysis of overall
effects on demand (see Table 1). The enhanced health
insurance subsidies and energy-related subsidies were the
largest contributors to increases in the deficit. The new
alternative minimum tax on corporations was the largest
contributor to reductions in the deficit. For each dollar
change in the deficit, the increases in subsidies would
probably have larger effects on overall demand (boosting it)
than the increases in revenues (which would reduce overall
demand). Those factors could contribute to the effects on
output and inflation being positive even when the overall
deficit was reduced.

Revenues Resulting From Increased Funding for
the Internal Revenue Service (Not included
above).......................................
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data source: Congressional Budget Office.
The estimated budgetary effects are of H.R. 5376, as amended in the
nature of a substitute (ERN22335) and posted on the website of the
Senate Majority Leader on July 27, 2022. Components may not sum to
totals because of rounding.
The budgetary effects in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 informed CBO's
analysis of the economic effects in calendar year 2023. The analysis
included the effects on the deficit from higher revenues resulting
from increased funding for the Internal Revenue Service. Under
guidelines agreed to by the legislative and executive branches, those
effects are not included in the total line from CBO's cost estimate
reporting the net effect on the deficit. Thus, the effects shown in
the memorandum are additional. Those revenues constitute a shift in
resources from the private sector to the government that would reduce
demand and thus reduce inflationary pressure.
Enacting the bill would also reduce some businesses'
incentives to invest through changes in the after-tax return
on private investment, pushing down output and inflation.
(See the answer to the fourth question in this letter for
further discussion.) In addition, enacting the bill would
reduce the incentives of some people to work, mainly because
of the enhanced health insurance subsidies, pushing down
output and pushing up inflation.
Enacting the bill would affect economic activity and
inflation beyond 2023. CBO has not evaluated those effects.
What Is the Highest Amount of Income That People Qualifying for
Expanded Health Insurance Subsidies Would Earn?
The answer to your question depends on people's age and
geographic location, and the number of enrollees in the
family. On the basis of nationwide average premiums projected
for 2023 under the bill, CBO estimates the following:
A 64-year-old would receive a premium tax credit if his or
her income did not exceed $163,700 in that year.
A 21-year-old would receive a premium tax credit if his or
her income did not exceed $54,600.
A family of four consisting of individuals ages 50, 50, 21,
and 21 would receive a premium tax credit if their household
income was no greater than $304,100.
A younger family of four, consisting of people ages 24, 24,
5, and 5, would receive a premium tax credit if the
household's income was no more than $192,700.
Premium tax credits are used to lower people's out-of-
pocket monthly premium contributions for health insurance
obtained through the marketplaces established by the
Affordable Care Act. The amount of the credit is calculated
as the difference between the benchmark premium for health
insurance (that is, the premium for the second-lowest-cost
silver plan available in a region) for the individual or
family and a specified maximum contribution, expressed as a
percentage of modified adjusted gross income. Those benchmark
premiums are also a function of age, geographic location, and
the number of enrollees. For example, the premium for a 64-
year-old is three times that for a 21-year-old in most
states. The premium tax credit is
[[Page H7663]]
thus correspondingly larger for older people than for younger
people.
The likelihood that the benchmark premium will exceed a
person's maximum contribution--and that the person will
therefore receive a premium tax credit--declines at higher
income levels. For those whose income is above 400 percent of
the federal poverty guideline, or $54,400 for a single person
in 2023, their maximum contribution would be 8.5 percent of
income through 2025 under the bill.
This analysis is based on nationwide average premiums. For
people living in states with premiums that are above or below
the average, the income at which they would no longer be
eligible for a premium tax credit would be higher or lower.
What Effect Would a New Alternative Minimum Tax on Corporations Have on
Business Investment and GDP?
Section 10101 of H.R. 5376 would increase taxes on
corporations by imposing a new alternative minimum tax equal
to 15 percent of income reported on financial statements by
certain large corporations--specifically, those whose
adjusted financial statement income exceeds $1 billion. The
staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that
the provision would increase federal revenues by $313.1
billion over the 2023-2031 period (with $96.6 billion of that
amount being generated in fiscal years 2023 and 2024). JCT
has projected that approximately 150 corporations would be
subject to the new tax each year and that just under half of
the revenues would come from the manufacturing sector.\6\
In CBO's assessment, the proposed new corporate minimum tax
would reduce the incentive for those large corporations to
invest, primarily by limiting the tax benefit of accelerated
depreciation and by decreasing the after-tax return on their
new investment. According to the generally accepted
accounting principles that are used for preparing financial
statements, firms must deduct the cost of investments over
the full useful life of the asset. In contrast, various
provisions of the tax code--including ``bonus''
depreciation--allow firms to deduct investment expenses more
quickly, increasing the tax benefit of those deductions and
the expected after-tax return on the investments. By setting
a new minimum tax, section 10101 would limit the tax benefit
of accelerated depreciation for affected corporations and,
all else being equal, reduce their business investment.
The provision would also affect private investment by
increasing federal revenues and, all else being equal, by
reducing the federal deficit and the amount of federal debt.
Less government borrowing would increase the amount of funds
available for private investment and put downward pressure on
interest rates, which would have a positive effect on
business investment, in CBO's view.
The net effect on business investment, and hence on GDP,
would depend on the relative magnitudes of the direct
incentive effect and the indirect effect resulting from the
change in the federal budget deficit. Additionally, the net
effect would depend on overall economic conditions.
Other provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act would also
affect incentives to invest. Thus, the legislation's overall
impact on business investment and GDP would differ from that
of just this provision considered by itself.
I hope that this information is useful to you.
Sincerely,
Phillip L. Swagel,
Director.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. Arrington).
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, the last time my Democrat colleagues
used reconciliation to jam through a massive partisan spending spree,
it was under the pretense of COVID recovery. Not only did they ``fail
to rescue America,'' they destroyed our recovery efforts and sent us
spiraling into recession.
Now, in the aftermath of their self-inflicted economic disaster, my
Democrat colleagues' response is to run the same play and expect a
different result.
Another false promise under the guise of a grandiose title, the
Inflation Reduction Act.
Nobody in America, Madam Speaker, believes that this bill will reduce
inflation. In fact, it is going to make inflation worse by imposing
massive tax hikes on U.S. job creators, strangling domestic oil and gas
production, unleashing an army of tens of thousands of IRS agents to
shake down working families and small businesses, handing out hundreds
of billions of dollars in Green New Deal giveaways that will jeopardize
America's energy security, putting America in the same position of
weakness as our European allies.
Mark my words, Madam Speaker, this bill will further fuel inflation,
deepen our recession, cripple our competitiveness, and increase costs
at the pump.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from
Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), who is retiring but has made many valued
contributions to our Nation and committee.
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, as a dear friend of Jackie Walorski, I share in the
grief of her passing and her staff's passing. It is very tragic.
Madam Speaker, this Inflation Reduction Act is historic legislation.
It puts people over politics by lowering families' kitchen-table costs
from prescription drugs to their energy expenses, creates millions of
good-paying jobs, delivers the most significant action to combat
climate change when Mother Nature is screaming at us to take action
today, and it substantially reduces the deficit by over $300 billion.
Now, on that last point, Madam Speaker, not once has a Republican-led
Congress brought a reconciliation bill to the floor that was paid for,
let alone reduces the national deficit.
In fact, as an example, when they passed their prescription drug bill
in 2004, not only did they not pay for it, not one nickel of it was
offset. Over $400 billion, the largest expansion of entitlement funding
since the creation of Social Security and Medicare, but there were no
offsets.
When we passed the Affordable Care Act a little over 10 years ago,
not only did we pay for it, but we also reduced the deficit. Just this
week, it was announced that health uninsured rates is at an all-time
historic low for our country, no less due to that Affordable Care Act.
Madam Speaker, they made that prescription drug bill even worse when
they passed it by inserting language in it that specifically made it
illegal for us to discuss prices or negotiate prices with the drug
companies. This bill changes that today by allowing once and for all
some price negotiation with the drug companies to deliver real relief
for our seniors.
Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the Joint Committee
on Taxation analysis that shows that families earning $75,000 or
$100,000 are four times more likely to have a tax hike under this bill
than a tax cut.
Nonpartisan Tax Scorekeeper: Average Working Family Is More Likely To
Be Worse Off Than Better Off Under Democrats' Tax Plan
Working families will be worse off under Democrats' higher
taxes, according to a new analysis from the nonpartisan Joint
Committee on Taxation. This is another devastating blow for
families after the Congressional Budget Office revealed that
Democrats' supercharged IRS expects to grab $20 billion from
lower- and middle-income earners.
Working Families at High Risk of Tax Hikes
Democrats have once again tried to hide the real effects of
this bill. New analysis from the nonpartisan Joint Committee
on Taxation (JCT) shows that the average working family is
more likely to be worse-off than better-off under Democrats'
tax plan.
For median-income families earning $50,000-$75,000,
households are 33 percent more likely to have a tax hike than
a tax cut.
It gets worse for every dollar earned--families earning
$75,000-$100,000 are four times more likely to have a tax
hike than a tax cut, and families earning $100,000-$200,000
are more than ten times more likely to have a tax hike than a
tax cut.
The bill does nothing--or makes things worse--for regular
working families. More than 92 percent of households with
incomes under $200,000 get no benefit--or a tax hike--under
Democrats' bill.
What's more, these tax hikes on working families do not
include the bill's superfund or methane taxes on American
energy, which disproportionately harm middle- and lower-
income households through higher prices at the pump and
bigger utility bills.
[[Page H7664]]
High-Income Households Enjoy Big Benefits
The JCT analysis shows the landscaping company owner and
his workers pay more, while the wealthy homeowner gets checks
from Washington for the solar panels on their roof. That's
because the ``winners'' under Democrat's tax plan are the
earners at the very top. Democrat's reckless spending plan
includes more than $250 billion in Green New Deal subsidies
that benefit the wealthy the most.
The percentage of $1 million-plus households getting a tax
cut (19.4 percent) is twice as high as any other income
group.
The group with the next highest proportion of tax cuts is
those earning $500,000-$1 million.
Over the long term, 72.5 percent of households with income
over $1 million will receive a tax cut.
More Bad News: $10.6 Billion in Tax Hikes on Working Families Next Year
Separate analysis by JCT isolates the effects of Democrats'
tax plan without the Obamacare subsidies that flow to a
limited number of households in an attempt to bribe them into
one-size-fits-all Obamacare plans. In 2023, Democrats would
increase the total tax burden on Americans under $200,000 in
income by $10.6 billion.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).
Mr. KUSTOFF. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to what the
Democrats call the Inflation Reduction Act which is really the
inflation expansion act.
Americans are grappling with an economy in recession and the highest
inflation that we have seen in 40 years. We are experiencing worker
shortages, empty grocery shelves, and higher energy prices. Now
Congressional Democrats are doubling down on this out-of-control
spending that led to this economic crisis.
This package that we are voting on today will raise taxes on
hardworking, middle-class families. It will authorize 87,000 new IRS
agents to target individuals and small businesses. It will reduce
lifesaving healthcare innovation by allowing the government to impose
price controls on drugs. It will hurt energy producers. And it will
certainly worsen inflation.
I am voting against this fundamentally flawed and defective package
because families, farmers, and small businesses across west Tennessee
and across the Nation need real solutions to these problems, not more
taxes and not more government spending.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, the bill we are considering in the House
today, the Inflation Reduction Act, started in the House of
Representatives as the Build Back Better Act.
Three years ago, all Democratic Members of the Ways and Means
Committee introduced the GREEN Act as the Committee's consensus
legislation for tax priorities relating to climate, clean energy, and
energy efficiency. The GREEN Act was reintroduced, again with all Ways
and Means Democrats, in the 117th Congress.
The GREEN Act formed the base of the climate and energy subtitle of
the Build Back Better Act, which the Ways and Means Committee marked up
in September 2021 and passed out of the House, following significant
input from the Senate, in November 2021. Many provisions of Subtitle D
of the Inflation Reduction Act remain substantially similar to those
that the House developed and passed.
As the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, I wish to offer
additional detail on the legislative intent behind certain provisions
included in this legislation.
This legislation provides long-term extensions of tax credits for
renewable technologies such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower
by extending section 45 and section 48 and enacting their successor
credits under sec. 45Y and section 48E. These provisions were drafted
with the goal of unleashing clean energy deployment, in line with
President Biden's pledge of a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels
in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030. Additionally,
this legislation provides enhanced credit amounts for projects
additional goals, such as those meeting domestic content requirements
or located in energy communities.
Currently, these renewable energy tax credits often remain out of
reach for low-income communities, which disproportionately bear the
burden of pollution. The Committee believes that our renewable energy
deployment should align with President Biden's Justice40 initiative,
which aims to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of federal
investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities.
To achieve these goals, we must bring all resources to bear across all
agencies--the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Energy, the
Environmental Protection Agency, the White House Council on
Environmental Quality, and more. For example, the Council on
Environmental Quality has developed a tool to assist federal agencies
with best targeting resources towards disadvantaged communities.
This goal is closely aligned with a provision that I am proud to have
worked with Rep. Danny Davis to include in this legislation. H.R. 5183,
provides an enhanced investment tax credit for projects in connection
with low-income communities, and is included in new section 45(e) and
section 48E(h) in this legislation. It draws on the success in
California of a clean energy program that helps hundreds of thousands
of low-income residents in multifamily housing enjoy the cost savings
and environmental advantages of solar.
This program provides allocated bonus credits for projects benefiting
low-income residents, including multifamily housing, community solar,
and individual low-income residential homeowners. The Committee intends
that the program prioritize low-income individuals and communities
throughout the selection process. Low-income individuals can benefit
from this legislation in multiple ways, including in the form of lower
electricity bills, reduction in locally harmful air pollution,
inclusive economic opportunities through training and employment on
such projects, and benefits to the community proven through active
engagement and outreach to community members. Thus, in selecting
projects for allocation, the Committee intends for the Secretary to
take into account which projects demonstrate the greatest health and
economic benefits for disadvantaged individuals (including benefits
related to the ability to withstand extreme weather events); the
greatest employment and wages for such individuals; and the greatest
engagement with and outreach to such individuals, including through
partnerships with local governments, community-based organizations, and
Indian tribal governments.
Additionally, this legislation is designed to provide maximum
flexibility to the Secretary in designing an efficient application and
allocation process to meet the needs of low-income residents.
Specifically, the legislation is intended to allow residential rooftop
providers to identify potential customers in qualifying census tracts
and submit applications to serve these customers up-front, before these
businesses have contractually engaged these customers. My understanding
is that these businesses will need to know if they have received a
credit allocation before they can offer the benefits of the credit to
these customers so that businesses can provide customers accurate
pricing information and cost savings to low-income customers.
This legislation also makes several important additions to the
property eligible under the section 48 investment tax credit and its
successor credit, section 48E.
The first is the addition of energy storage technologies. This
provision originated as H.R. 1684, the Energy Storage Tax Incentive and
Deployment, as advanced by Representatives Mike Doyle and Earl
Blumenauer, and included in the GREEN Act and the Build Back Better
Act. It is the Committee's intent that the technologies included in
H.R. 1684, such as pumped hydropower, are considered energy storage
technologies for this legislation.
Pumped-storage hydroelectric facilities are sometimes called water
batteries. Electricity is used to pump water from a lower to an upper
reservoir. When needed, this water is then released and run through
turbines to convert the stored energy back into electricity.
The definition of energy storage technologies includes ``property . .
. which receives, stores, and delivers energy for conversion to
electricity'' under new section 48(c)(6)(A)(i). Thus, it is the
Committee's intent such property not only include the two reservoirs as
well as the pipe and pump to move the water uphill, but also the
turbines and step-up transformer to convert the stored energy back into
electricity.
Additionally, relating to the coordination of the credit for energy
storage technologies and the section 45 production tax credit, the
Committee intends that a credit is allowed for energy storage
technology under section 48 regardless of whether it is part of a
facility for which a credit under section 45 is or has been allowed.
The second is the addition of electrochromatic glass, also known as
dynamic glass, to section 48(a)(3)(A)(ii). It is the Committee's intent
that the basis for such property should include the cost of the glass
itself including the devices, the wiring and other components necessary
for the glass to change its light transmittance properties, as well as
the window frame and the capitalized costs for the installation of
these and any other related components.
Additionally, this legislation creates new section 45W, the credit
for qualified commercial clean vehicles, to incentivize clean vehicles
and mobile machinery. In including mobile
[[Page H7665]]
machinery, the Committee intends to incentivize cleaner farm equipment,
construction equipment, and other equipment. As the Secretary develops
regulations or other guidance to carry out the purposes of this
section, the Committee believes it is appropriate to consider industry
standards when applying rules in the section that reference vehicles.
For example, the Secretary may look established methods of determining
equipment weight for purposes of determining credit limits based upon
gross vehicle weights and may allow, as a substitute, other commonly
used identification or serial numbers when administering the vehicle
identification number requIrements.
This legislation is historic, and I look forward to seeing the impact
these, and the many other clean energy incentives contained in this
bill, have on our carbon reduction goals in the coming years.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), who is always pleased to let us know what he
is thinking.
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, the American people put Democrats in charge to raise
our Nation from its knees--unless we have short memories.
We are putting people over powerful interests. We are rebuilding our
economy for working families. We are providing historically low
healthcare premiums for nearly 12 million Americans, including over
20,000 in my own district of New Jersey.
We are making the single largest investment in clean energy to secure
a livable future. Our planet is at the precipice of catastrophe. So we
are combating climate change and creating 9 million jobs in the
process.
Not bad, Madam Speaker, not bad.
Our bill includes legislation I happen to champion to expand zero-
emission nuclear energy and offshore wind, where New Jersey leads the
way. I worked on a bipartisan basis on those two issues, and there is
nothing said today about that by my friends on the other side.
For years, Republicans sabotaged the IRS. The record is clear. They
safeguarded loopholes to help a privileged few pay a pittance in taxes.
And that ends today.
Five years ago, Republicans passed a $2 trillion tax scam for the
rich and the corporate tycoons. Today, we are closing the tax gap and
providing tax fairness.
Democrats are making prescription drugs affordable.
Democrats are lowering healthcare costs.
God bless our great country.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the
Congressional Budget Office, which confirms this bill will actually
increase the cost of new drugs.
U.S. Congress,
Congressional Budget Office,
Washington, DC, August 4, 2022.
Re Additional Information About Prescription Drug Legislation
Hon. Jason Smith,
Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,
U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
Dear Congressman: This letter provides additional
information that you and your colleagues requested about
subtitle I of the reconciliation recommendations of the
Senate Committee on Finance regarding prescription drug
legislation. You asked about how provisions involving
inflation rebates and the negotiation of drug prices would
affect launch prices for new drugs and the introduction of
new generic drugs. You also asked how a provision to
stabilize premiums as a part of the redesign of Medicare's
benefits would affect the federal budget and premiums.
Effect of the Inflation-Rebate and Negotiation Provisions on Launch
Prices
The Congressional Budget Office projects that the
inflation-rebate and negotiation provisions would increase
the launch prices for drugs that are not yet on the market
relative to what such prices would be otherwise. That effect
would primarily be driven by the inflation-rebate provisions
(sections 129101 and 129102), which would begin to apply to
prices within 12 months of a given drug's entering the
market. Under those provisions, manufacturers would have an
incentive to launch new drugs at a higher price to offset
slower growth in prices over time. The negotiation provision
(section 129001) would have less of an impact on launch
prices, CBO expects: Although the ceiling for a drug's
negotiated price is based on its price from a prior year,
negotiation could not occur until drugs were on the market
for a number of years--at least 7 for small-molecule drugs
and 11 for biologics.
Higher launch prices would primarily affect spending for
drugs in the Medicaid program, CBO projects, because an
increase in that program's basic rebate brought about by the
higher launch prices would only partly offset those prices.
Higher launch prices would also tend to affect spending for
drugs covered by Part B of the Medicare program because that
program's payments for those drugs are based on the average
sales prices. Over time, slower price growth would attenuate
the effect of higher launch prices.
In the commercial and Medicare Part D segments of the
market, spending would be less affected by higher launch
prices, CBO estimates, because manufacturers would have more
flexibility to manage rebates to maximize their revenues in
those sectors.
Effect of the Negotiation Provision on the Introduction of New Generic
Drugs
CBO has not analyzed the effects of the negotiation
provision on the introduction of new generic drugs. In
projecting the effects of the negotiation provision, CBO
estimated the share of spending that would be subject to
negotiation each year and the average reduction in prices
that would stem from the negotiations. But the agency did not
analyze how the provision would affect prices or spending on
specific drugs, nor did it quantify any impact on the
introduction of new generic drugs.
Effects of the Premium-Stabilization Provision
Under the premium-stabilization provision (section 129201),
the federal government would subsidize any growth in
beneficiaries' base premiums for Medicare Part D exceeding 6
percent from one year to the next over the 2024-2029 period.
The provision subsequently would lower the base premium
percentage (the percentage of the average cost of standard
Part D coverage that is used to calculate beneficiaries'
premiums) to ensure that premiums did not grow by more than 6
percent between 2029 and 2030. That subsidy and subsequent
reduction in premiums would increase federal spending by
roughly $40 billion over the 2024-2031 period, CBO estimates.
Beneficiaries' spending on premiums would be lower under the
premium-stabilization provision than it would be without it.
That estimate is an average effect among the possible paths
of premiums that CBO considered when modeling the uncertainty
of future outcomes. Under some of those paths, premiums would
grow by less than 6 percent a year, and the provision would
have no cost; under others, premiums would grow faster, and
the provision would generate costs.
I hope this information is useful to you and your
colleagues. Please contact me if you have further questions.
Sincerely,
Phillip L. Swagel,
Director.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), my colleague on the Committee on Ways and
Means.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, for everyone here, this is a subsidy
bill. And this is the classic difference between the left and the
right. They are functionally subsidizing. We on the right actually want
to change the market. We want competition.
So I am going to pull out one very simple example. In here, we have
$2.5 billion of subsidies for our ports to get greener and more
efficient. But then the Democrats slip in language that says human-
operated, meaning you are not going to take on the unions, you are not
actually going to make it more efficient, you are not going to actually
embrace disruption and technology.
We keep coming to the floor and talking about things that would make
our ports greener, faster, more efficient, feed the supply chain--these
electric rail cars, except you functionally just made them not happen.
This is a subsidy for those unions, those folks who right checks to
the left. You claim you are making the environment better and cleaner,
but then you build the very barriers in the language that stop those
good things from happening.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), one of the most talented members of the
committee.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I associate myself
with the remarks made by my colleagues relative to our tragic loss of
Representative Walorski who was the ranking member of the subcommittee
that I chair.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Inflation Reduction
Act of 2022. This is the most transformative piece of legislation that
I have seen. It lowers family healthcare costs, reduces drug and energy
costs, makes the largest investment in addressing climate change in the
history of this country, and cuts carbon emissions by 40 percent.
[[Page H7666]]
This bill would create millions of good-paying, union jobs and
stimulate economic growth and development across the Nation. It
incentivizes manufacturing and reduces our reliance upon foreign-made
products.
This bill does what we have been trying to do for years, and that is,
it empowers Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs.
Millions of seniors and disabled individuals will benefit from this
provision alone, not to mention what the monthly cap on the price of
insulin would do for millions of others.
Madam Speaker, this bill would cut the deficit and lower inflation,
will not cost the average taxpayer one additional cent, unless they
earn $400,000 annually or more. One feature of this bill that I am
especially proud of is the enhanced tax credit to bring solar and wind
energy to low-income communities. This tax credit will assist these
communities.
Madam Speaker, this is a great bill, and I urge its passage.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Congressional
Budget Office report from this morning, while we were on the House
floor, which confirms IRS audits will generate tens of billions of
dollars for middle-class families making less than $400,000.
CBO has received a number of questions regarding our
estimate of an amendment offered by Senator Crapo during the
floor debate on H.R. 5376 last weekend. That amendment,
#5404, would limit the use of additional funds for the
Internal Revenue Service. If the amendment had been adopted
none of the additional funds could have been used to audit
taxpayers with taxable incomes below $400,000.
CBO did not complete a formal cost estimate in advance of
consideration of the amendment but the agency did provide the
following information to the Senate Budget Committee:
CBO estimates that the amendment 5404 would have the
following effects:
No effect on outlays in the one or ten year budget windows;
would reduce outlays in the five year budget window.
No effect on revenues in the one year budget window; would
reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the
provisions of section 10301 in the five and ten year budget
windows.
No effect on outlays after 2031 but would decrease the
``non-scorable'' revenue resulting from the provisions of
section 10301 after 2031.
CBO has not completed a point estimate of this amendment
but the preliminary assessment indicates that amendment 5404
would reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the
provisions of section 10301 by at least $20 billion over the
FY2022-FY2031 period.
Thanks,
Leigh Angres,
Director of Legislative Affairs,
Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), my colleague from the Committee on Ways and
Means.
{time}  1345
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from
Texas, and I hate to see him leave because he has been so productive.
Madam Speaker, it is interesting. We had the talk and hear it going
back and forth about what the IRS is not going to do. I would just tell
my fellow citizens--and I am not going to talk to the other side
because we shouldn't be doing that anyway.
There is something wrong whenever we look at the money that is being
spent to hire agents for enforcement. I would tell my fellow citizens:
Be afraid. Be very afraid. If the events of this week don't shake you
to the bottom as to what this government can do to you whenever it
chooses to do it and however it chooses to do it, understand that this
agency, the IRS, is the most feared agency in the United States
Government. It is incredible the power that it wields.
It is incredible that it is going to increase the number of
enforcement officers. They are not coming in to help with the
processing because all of us in Congress, including my friends on the
other side, have been doing the work of the IRS for the IRS. They
haven't been back to work full time for 2\1/2\ years.
Madam Speaker, I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to vote
``no'' on this monstrosity that does not do anything about inflation
but continues to harass hardworking American taxpayers.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, this is misinformation about the IRS. They need the
funding to better serve the American people. The idea that, all of a
sudden, there is an army of IRS agents that is coming after the
American family doesn't stand up under the magnifying glass of critical
analysis.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York
(Mr. Higgins), a really capable member of the Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speaker, the 1970 Clean Air Act was
passed by a Democratic-led Congress and a Republican President after
millions of Americans demanded change. Five decades later, a new
generation of Americans is calling on Congress to act on our Nation's
biggest challenges. The Inflation Reduction Act is not just a good
climate bill; it is also a major achievement.
To address the climate crisis, it makes a $369 billion investment
toward decarbonizing our Nation. The bill addresses environmental
justice. Everyone should benefit from a cleaner environment, especially
those who are vulnerable to disease because of where they live.
The bill finally helps Medicare negotiate a better deal on drug
prices. This provision will save lives and help seniors enjoy their
retirement without fear of poverty due to the cost of their
medications.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation,
which is vital to our Nation's future.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following
report from 2020 from a group that tracks government spending, which
details how the IRS is currently armed with 4,600 guns and 5 million
rounds of ammunition. That is not fear-mongering; these are the facts.
IRS Has 4,600 Guns and Five Milion Rounds of Ammo: Will Dem Bill Grow
Arsenal?
The IRS has 4,600 guns and five million rounds of
ammunition according to a report from OpenTheBooks published
in 2020. With Democrats on the verge of passing $80 billion
in additional funding to facilitate the hiring of 87,000 new
agents, how much will this arsenal grow?
The Democrats' push to increase the size and power of the
IRS has significant criminal justice and basic due process
ramifications.
An OpenTheBooks report titled The Militarization of U.S.
Executive Agencies shows that, even without the proposed $80
billion increase in funding, the IRS Criminal Investigation
Division (IRS-CI) is already heavily armed at the expense of
the American taxpayer.
The current 4,600-gun stockpile includes:
3,282 pistols
621 shotguns
539 rifles
15 fully automatic firearms
4 revolvers
According to the Government Accountability Office the
ammunition breakdown is as follows:
Pistol and revolver rounds: 3,151,500
Rifle rounds: 1,472,050
Shotgun rounds: 367,750
Fully automatic firearm rounds: 56,000
When OpenTheBooks directly asked the IRS for an accounting
of its gun locker, the agency responded, ``We don't have one
[an inventory], but could create one for you, if important.''
There are seven reasons to be concerned about the IRS
having more power, more money, and more guns:
1. irs fails to ensure armed agents receive required firearms training
In order to carry or use an IRS-owned weapon, agents must:
engage in handgun firing training at least once each quarter,
shoot at least the minimum of 75 percentage points on the
firearms qualifying test using the issued handgun during two
nonconsecutive quarters, participate in biannual firearms
building entry exercises, participate in an annual briefing
on firearms safety and security policies and IRS-CI's
directives and procedures regarding the safe handling and
storage of firearms, and participate in a briefing each
quarter regarding the policy of discharging a firearm at a
moving vehicle.
IRS-CI's National Criminal Investigation Training Academy
(NCITA) is responsible for implementing the formalized
firearms training and qualification program nationwide. This
includes developing the firearm qualification requirements
they are expected to meet and the training special agents
will undergo. Despite these requirements, CI agents have
regularly failed to stay up to date on training or report
incidents, endangering the taxpayers they are supposed to
protect.
According to reports from the Treasury Inspector General
for Tax Administration (TIGTA), the IRS has repeatedly failed
to ensure that procedures relating to firearms are properly
followed:
``there is no national-level review of firearms training
records to ensure that all special agents meet the
qualification requirements.''
Special agents are required to surrender their weapons when
they fail to participate
[[Page H7667]]
in this training, however this often does not happen.
As noted by the Inspector General:
``However, there is currently little consequence for
special agents who fail to meet the training requirements
listed on the checklist.''
The Inspector General noted the IRS failed to secure the
firearms of those who did not meet their requirements:
``controls did not ensure that CI personnel properly
secured firearms when special agents failed to meet the
biannual standard qualification requirement. CI was only able
to provide evidence that firearms were surrendered in nine of
the 27 instances when special agents did not qualify. The
Criminal Investigation Management Information System was only
updated to reflect the custody change in four of those nine
instances.
The Inspector General noted that the IRS lapses torpedo its
ability to effectively try cases:
``Court decisions in the past have held law enforcement
entities liable because their law enforcement agents did not
have training that reflected the environment that they would
likely encounter, such as training involving moving targets
and low-light conditions. Other court decisions underscored
the importance of properly documenting firearms training. One
decision dismissed the claims against a law enforcement
entity that maintained thorough records that showed the law
enforcement personnel had been trained. Another decision
upheld a jury's conclusion that undocumented police training
did not constitute adequate training.''
The IRS failure to conduct proper internal oversight of its
weapons could have grave consequences for the public. As
noted by the Inspector General:
``If there is insufficient oversight, special agents in
possession of firearms who are not properly trained and
qualified could endanger other special agents and the
public.''
2. irs agents accidentally fire their weapons more often than they
intentionally fire them
A TIGTA report found that special agents at the IRS
Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI) accidentally fired
their weapons more often than they intentionally fired them:
``According to documentation provided by all 26 CI field
offices, the NCITA, and the TIGTA OI, there were a total of
eight firearm discharges classified as intentional use of
force incidents and 11 discharges classified as accidental
during FYs 2009 through 2011.''
3. irs conceals details of accidental gun discharges
The agency's lackadaisical approach to firearm safety has
led to easily preventable accidents. The Inspector General
cryptically references IRS accidental discharges that caused
``property damage or personal injury'':
``In three of the four accidental discharges that were not
reported, the accidental discharges may have resulted in
property damage or personal injury.''
The details of these incidents are--for some reason--
redacted in the report:
IRS-CI management is required to be notified when a special
agent discharges their weapon. CI must report all accidental
discharge incidents externally to the TIGTA OI and internally
to the NCITA and the Director of Field Operations. Despite
these directives, CI did not always properly disclose
accidental discharges:
``we found that four accidental discharges were not
properly reported. This included two that were not reported
to both to the TIGTA OI and the NCITA. one that was not
reported to the TIGTA OI, and one that was not reported
internally to the NCITA.''
4. IRS AGENTS DO NOT ALWAYS UNDERGO REMEDIAL TRAINING AFTER DISCHARGES
DUE TO AGENT NEGLIGENCE
Compounding their mistakes, agents did not always provide
remedial training when an accidental discharge occurred. Even
when they did undergo training, the standards remained wildly
inconsistent. The Inspector General found that:
``two of the four use of force coordinators stated that
they may require the special agent to participate in some
type of remedial training, one stated that the special agent
would be counseled, and one stated that there would be no
additional training required.''
5. IRS HAS A HISTORY OF VIOLATING BASIC DUE PROCESS RIGHTS
In a 2017 report, the IRS-CI was shown to have regularly
violated taxpayers' rights and skirted or ignored due process
requirements when investigating taxpayers for allegedly
violating the existing $10,000 currency transaction reporting
requirements
TIGTA found that only 8 percent of investigations uncovered
violations of tax law. In many cases, IRS-CI had not
considered reasonable explanations from those investigated,
property owners were not adequately informed of their rights
nor informed of seizure of their property, and outcomes in
cases lacked consistency, violating the Eighth Amendment to
the Constitution.
6. IRS HAS APPALLING EVIDENCE STORAGE HABITS
The IRS Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI) was
repeatedly found to leave critical evidence sitting around in
break rooms, hallways and stacked outside cubicles, according
to a report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax
Administration (TIGTA). In addition, the report found that CI
offices did not maintain an Evidence Access Control Log to
record access to areas where evidence is stored:
During our walkthroughs at the CI offices, we observed that
some sites had evidence placed in hallways. stacked outside
cubicles, and in break rooms. In addition, seven of the nine
offices did not keep grand jury material in a separate,
secure area. The grand jury material was intermingled with
non-grand jury evidence and other case file information.
The agency's careless approach to evidence storage has
grave ramifications, as noted by the Inspector General:
In order for a seized item to be admissible as evidence, it
is necessary to prove that the item is in the same condition
as when it was seized. If evidence is not stored properly,
evidence may have been inappropriately disclosed, lost,
tampered with, or stolen. In addition, the chain of custody
could be called into question, which could result in the item
being deemed inadmissible in court.
The report suggests the IRS is an outlier in terms of its
sloppy handling of evidence, compared to other federal law
enforcement agencies:
In addition, we interviewed representatives from two other
Federal law enforcement agencies to gain an understanding of
how they maintained their chain of custody. It was apparent
from these interviews that both Federal agencies have an
extensive chain of custody process. For example, each agency
limits access to the locked evidence room, which is
maintained by an evidence custodian. If evidence needs to be
removed from the room, an agent must gain access through the
evidence custodian and a record of that access is maintained.
This process helps ensure that evidence does not become lost
or misplaced and helps keep the chain of custody from being
broken.
Each IRS-CI special agent has the authority to investigate,
inquire, and receive information. Of the investigative
techniques available to agents, one of the most frequently
used is the authority to conduct searches and issue search
and seizure warrants.
The Federal Government is responsible for properly
maintaining the chain of custody for any seized items. CI
agents must be able to prove it is the same item that was
seized and that the item is in the same condition as when it
was seized in order for that seized item to be admissible as
evidence.
Grand jury-related evidence must be kept separate from
other non-grand jury evidence. Despite these clear
directives, the CI has routinely ignored protocol, violating
the rights of the taxpayers they are supposed to protect.
7. IRS HAS CONDUCTED MANY ARMED RAIDS ON INNOCENT AMERICANS
In the late 1990s, the IRS came under scrutiny for the
harsh tactics it used to enforce the tax code. With tens of
billion in new funding, it is not hard to see how these
abuses could return.
A 1998 article by Washington Post noted many small business
owners were harassed by the IRS, only for the agency to find
no evidence of wrongdoing.
``An Oklahoma tax-return preparer, a Texas oilman and a
Virginia restaurateur told lawmakers how raiding parties of
armed agents from the IRS Criminal Investigation Division
barged into their homes or offices, frightened their
employees and families--and ultimately came up empty-
handed.''
``Two of the men said they later found that former
employees had precipitated the raids, and that the IRS had
done little or no checking on their informants' credibility.
The third witness said he never could determine why he was
targeted.''
One man described over a dozen armed IRS officials raiding
his offices, seizing business documents, and harassing
clients and employees:
``Richard Gardner, whose company prepares 4,500 to 6,000
tax returns each year, said that one morning in 1995, he was
called out of a meeting. He found 15 IRS agents and a half-
dozen U.S. marshals in his lobby, ``all armed and wearing
those jackets that say in bright letters IRS' or U.S.
Marshal' on the back.''
``They seized his client records, computers, personal
papers and other files, he said, and held them for two years
while the IRS investigation continued. Gardner was able to
buy new computers and continue in business, but the damage to
his business was extensive. He said IRS agents went to
clients and demanded they wear hidden microphones when
meeting with Gardner; they hauled his wife before a grand
jury; and his employees were told they would be able to buy
his business cheaply because he would be out of business
soon.''
These were not isolated cases. A 1998 article by the New
York Times described ``military style raids'' by IRS agents
against taxpayers who were accused of nonviolent behavior
The Senate Finance Committee held a series of IRS oversight
hearings in 1998. Among many witnesses to abuses carried out
by armed IRS agents, a Virginia restaurant owner testified
the following on April 29, 1998:
``Armed agents, accompanied by drug-sniffing dogs, stormed
my restaurants during breakfast, ordered patrons out of the
restaurant, and began interrogating my employees.
The IRS impounded my records, my cash registers, and my
computers.''
[[Page H7668]]
``When the raid occurred at my home, the front door was
torn from the hinges, my dogs were impounded, along with my
safe and 12 years of my personal income tax returns and
supporting documents.''
Giving more money, power and guns to an agency with a
terrible firearms safety record and a terrible due process
record is alarming to law-abiding Americans.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, there are so many things wrong with the
policies in this bill. It will certainly punish Americans' pocketbooks
through record-high inflation, new taxes, and an army of IRS agents. It
can get even worse.
This drug price setting regime in the bill, which I want to speak
about briefly, may very well put American lives at risk. The CBO
agreed. Fewer drugs will be developed as a result of the policies in
this bill.
According to a study from the University of Chicago, government price
controls in the bill will block 342 new cures from reaching market over
the coming decades. That means that our constituents and family members
who are battling diseases like cancer or Alzheimer's may well be left
with no hope of finding a cure.
The university estimates that blocking these cures will collectively
take 330 million years off of Americans' lives. That is 1 year per
American, which, by the way, is a toll 31 times worse than the COVID-19
pandemic.
American innovation and ingenuity got this country out of the COVID-
19 pandemic. This bill abandons free enterprise in favor of socialism
and will cost the taxpayer too many dollars and cancer patients too
many years.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, a reminder that there are, I believe, almost
600,425 Medicare beneficiaries who have diabetes in Pennsylvania. It is
important that the bill that we have caps insulin costs.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama
(Ms. Sewell), a terrific member of the committee.
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the
Inflation Reduction Act.
This transformational legislation will lower healthcare costs for
millions of Americans and thousands of Alabamians by extending ACA tax
credits for an additional 3 years and reducing the prescription drug
costs for our seniors by allowing HHS, for the first time, to negotiate
drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and capping out-of-pocket
drug costs to $2,000 per year. This is a big deal for American families
and especially the families that I represent in Alabama.
This bill is also the single largest climate investment in America's
history. This bill includes my Carbon Capture and Sequestration
Expansion Act that will extend the 45 credit eligibilities for carbon
capture projects to 2023.
When I think about all the great things that are in this particular
bill, it is truly transformational for the people that I represent and
for the American people.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.
Let's put people first over politics.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following Joint
Committee on Taxation analysis that shows that American manufacturers
are hardest hit by the Democrats' made in America tax--$200 billion--
and they will pay over half of that tax.
Congress of the United States,
Joint Committee on Taxation,
Washington, DC, August 11, 2022.
Memorandum
To: Redacted
From: Thomas A. Barthold
Subject: Revenue Estimate
This memorandum is in response to your request for an
estimate of how the burden of the corporate minimum financial
statement income tax as contained in section 10101 of an
amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 5376. ``An
Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Title II of S.
Con. Res. 14'' as passed by the Senate on August 7, 2022,
would fall across different industrial sectors.
Business income tax returns ask taxpayers to report the
industry in which they are primarily engaged, identifying the
industry by the code numbers established under the North
American Industrial Classification System (``NAICS code'').
This is self-reported and the Internal Revenue Service does
not verify the accuracy of the classification stated by the
taxpayer. The NAICS code system allows data to be aggregated
at different levels of general categorization. Two-digit
codes are the broadest categorization. For example, code 31
encompasses all manufacturing. As we project that only
approximately 150 taxpayers annually will be subject to the
proposed book minimum tax, in the accompanying table we
generally report results by two-digit reporting to protect
the privacy of the tax return data on which we base our
analysis.
We estimate the corporate minimum financial statement
income tax as contained in the amendment in the nature of a
substitute to H.R. 5376 as passed by the Senate would have
the following effect on Federal fiscal year budget receipts.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to
this reckless bill today. I want to speak specifically to one issue,
and that is medicine.
As a practicing physician, I have seen miraculous curative
advancements made in medicine over the last 15 years. This partisan
package will destroy medical innovation and cripple independent private
physicians. Up to 342 new lifesaving drugs will be prevented by this
bill.
We all agree that the cost of medicine is way too high in this
country, but instead of attacking the real causes, we are now going to
be shifting Medicare dollars away from doctors, those who actually take
care of patients, and give them to insurance companies and Green New
Deal policies.
Some physicians will see, on average, a 40 percent reduction in
reimbursement. Given the constant threats of Medicare cuts for
physicians, who the hell would want to practice medicine or could
afford to practice medicine in this country anymore?
This scheme will have long-lasting negative impacts on patients,
physicians, and the solvency of Medicare, and it will set a dangerous
precedent for future medicine to use Medicare as a piggy bank to
subsidize unrelated policies.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
[[Page H7669]]
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman
from Washington (Ms. DelBene), who is well known for her work in the
renewable energy field.
Ms. DelBENE. Madam Speaker, Congresswoman Jackie Walorski was a
friend, and I send my deepest condolences to her family and the
families of Zackery Potts and Emma Thomson.
Madam Speaker, the Inflation Reduction Act is nothing less than
historic and shows our constituents that governance can still work for
them.
The bill extends the Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies that
have saved 13 million Americans an average of $800 a year on health
coverage.
It will enable the U.S. to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent
by 2030 through investments like my clean hydrogen provision and make
it more affordable for families to purchase energy and cost-saving
products like electric vehicles and solar panels.
These are provisions that the New Democrat Coalition and I have been
calling for from the beginning. For our seniors, the bill will lower
the costs of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower
prices and will cap out-of-pocket drug spending at $2,000 annually.
These are tangible benefits for Americans.
The legislation is fully paid for by ensuring corporations pay their
fair share and providing the IRS with the resources it needs after
decades of Republican-driven budget cuts.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I remind my
colleagues that there are 533,775 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes
in North Carolina, but the gentleman remains against this bill capping
insulin costs and Medicare at $35 per month.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following
letter of opposition, which represents America's independent natural
gas and oil production industry, which says this bill will only
exacerbate--make worse--our Nation's energy crisis.
August 11, 2022.
Hon. Nancy Pelosi,
Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. Kevin McCarthy,
Republican Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: The undersigned
trade associations, representing thousands of businesses
across the United States that collectively employ millions of
Americans, write to express our opposition to the Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA) as passed by the U.S. Senate. Further, we
write to urge you to reconsider policies within the
legislation before proceeding.
The United States has experienced its second consecutive
quarter of negative GDP growth, and American consumers are
facing record high inflation. We share the goal of addressing
climate change, as evidenced in the policies we support and
in the actions that we take every day. However, the
considerable tax increases and new government spending in the
IRA amount to the wrong policies at the wrong time.
We are also facing the most significant global energy
crisis since the 1970's, and U.S. energy security--and that
of our strategic allies abroad--is being put to the test.
Further, U.S. energy costs have increased 40 percent over the
past twelve months, creating a serious strain on American
household incomes.
With these current conditions as the backdrop for this
legislation, there are several specific policies included in
the IRA which are particularly troubling and deserve re-
consideration. We would like to draw your attention to three
such provisions:
1. The IRA imposes a new corporate minimum tax, increasing
taxes on Americans by more than $300 billion over the next 10
years. As President Obama noted in 2009, ``the last thing you
want to do is raise taxes in the middle of a recession.''
2. The IRA imposes an $11.7 billion tax on crude oil and
petroleum products. At a time of record-high energy prices,
Congress should not add additional costs on American energy
companies competing globally.
3. The IRA imposes additional constraints on the ability of
companies to develop and produce the energy that Americans
need to fuel our economy and strengthen our energy security.
This includes increased fees on domestic production and the
establishment of a new $6.3 billion natural gas tax.
Finally, the IRA fails to address permitting reform, which
is desperately needed and is essential to effectively deliver
affordable, reliable energy to consumers in a growing
economy.
To date, neither the House nor the Senate have introduced
comprehensive permitting reform legislation. We urge Congress
to quickly consider and pass permitting reform without delay.
For the above-stated reasons, we express our opposition to
the IRA and request that you reconsider passage of this
legislation.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. Clyde).
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, one of the most egregious provisions in
this socialist spending bill includes providing $80 billion to the IRS
for hiring 87,000 new agents to audit hardworking Americans.
After my small business was wrongfully targeted by the IRS back in
2013, I know a thing or two about how burdensome and costly battles
with the IRS can be. I will tell you, it is a grueling fight that most
Americans simply cannot endure.
This is precisely why I introduced an amendment to eliminate the IRS
enforcement provision in this severely misguided legislation. The
Democrats rejected it, confirming their intent to supercharge IRS
audits in order to pay for their Big Government socialist agenda.
This week has also proven just how corrupt our Federal agencies are
and the length they are willing to go to persecute political opponents.
Think about it: If the left will weaponize the FBI to raid President
Trump's personal residence, they will surely weaponize the IRS' new
87,000 agents, many of whom will be trained in the use of deadly force,
to go after any American citizen.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on supersizing and
weaponizing the IRS against the American people.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. Chu), whose work in the arena of renewable energy
is well known.
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the
Inflation Reduction Act.
This historic legislation will make real, tangible differences in the
lives and livelihoods of people back home in southern California and
across the Nation. It is imperative we pass this once-in-a-generation
bill today.
The American people are struggling to afford medications, health
insurance, and their energy expenses, all while battling the impacts of
climate change every day. They are desperate for Congress to take
action to address the real challenges they are facing in their everyday
lives.
This is exactly what this bill does. It lowers the costs of
prescription drugs for seniors to no more than $2,000 yearly. It curbs
the rising costs of utilities
[[Page H7670]]
and creates good-paying jobs nationwide in the process. It makes
healthcare more affordable for millions of Americans by shoring up the
Affordable Care Act.
Today, we are going to combat climate change, ensure corporations pay
their fair share, and reduce prices for workers and families. In fact,
we are making the largest and most ambitious investment in clean and
renewable energy in our Nation's history, finally reversing years of
underinvestment at the IRS and building a fairer tax system that will
invest in workers without raising taxes on families and small
businesses.
Today, we are delivering on a promise made to Americans by passing
this critical bill. We must commit to putting people over politics.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time Chairman Neal
and I have remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 15 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 9\1/2\ minutes
remaining.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record this Penn Wharton
School of Business analysis that debunks the Inflation Reduction Act,
showing how this bill will reduce inflation by less than a tenth of 1
percent in the first 5 years, with zero impact on inflation after that.
[From Penn Wharton]
Senate-Passed Inflation Reduction Act: Estimates of Budgetary and
Macroeconomic Effects
key points
PWBM estimates that the Senate-Passed Inflation Reduction
Act, as written, would reduce cumulative deficits by $264
billion over the 10-year budget window.
The Act would have no meaningful effect on inflation in the
near term but would reduce inflation by around 0.1 percentage
points by the middle of the first decade. These point
estimates, however, are not statistically different from
zero, indicating a low level of confidence that the
legislation would have any measurable impact on inflation.
Relative to current law, the Act would slightly reduce GDP
in the first decade while slightly increasing GDP by 2050.
These estimates include the impact of debt reduction, carbon
reduction, and tax incentives on investments and working
hours.
Most, but not all, of the tax increases fall on higher
income households. However, future generations, including
higher-income households, gain from the improved economy,
including a reduction in carbon emissions.
introduction
On Sunday August 7th, the U.S. Senate passed the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 under FY2022 budget reconciliation
instructions. PWBM recently analyzed a previous version of
the bill. We also compared our analysis against that of the
Joint Tax Committee and Congressional Budget Office who use
an older economics baseline from July 2021.
In this brief, PWBM analyzes the budgetary, macroeconomic,
and distributional effects of the final Senate passed
version. In line with the previously released version of the
bill, the Act provides for new spending and tax incentives
related to the adoption of clean energy technology, both at
the industrial and consumer level. It extends a temporary
expansion of Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance
subsidies for an additional two years. To offset these
deficit-increasing initiatives, the bill imposes new taxes on
certain businesses, reduces government outlays on
prescription drugs through pricing reforms. It also provides
for new IRS funding which PWBM estimates would increase
revenue collections above new outlays.
provision descriptions and estimated budgetary effects
The final version of the Act makes several key amendments
to the version we previously analyzed. First, the new
corporate minimum tax no longer restricts the tax benefit of
accelerated depreciation, and private equity firms are
exempted from the tax. Second, the carried interest provision
was removed. Third, new revenue raising provisions (a tax on
stock buybacks and a restriction on pass-through loss
deductions) were added. Fourth, due to Senate rules, drug
price inflation caps for private insurance plans were
removed.
More specifically, the Act proposes the following policy
changes:
Extension of expanded ACA subsidies. Extends the temporary
expansion of Premium Tax Credits through 2025. The expansion,
which offers eligibility to households above 400 percent of
the poverty line, is scheduled to expire at the end of 2022
under current law.
Climate and energy provisions. Includes tax rebates and
credits to lower energy costs for households; tax credits,
research, loans, and grants to increase domestic
manufacturing capacity for wind turbines, solar panels,
batteries, and other essential components of clean energy
production and storage; tax credits to reduce carbon
emissions; programs to reduce the environmental impact of
agriculture; a new fee on methane emissions; and more.
Minimum tax on corporations' book income. Creates a new 15
percent corporate alternative minimum tax based on the
financial statement income of corporations with at least $1
billion in such income. Allows for bonus and accelerated
depreciation deductions when calculating taxable book income.
Tax on share repurchases. Imposes a new 1 percent tax on
corporations' net repurchase of stock.
Extension of excess noncorporate losses limitation. Extends
the limitation on the deduction of pass-through losses
through tax year 2028, which under current law is scheduled
to expire at the end of 2026. The maximum deductible loss,
which is indexed to inflation, is $540,000 for married
taxpayers in 2022.
Prescription drug price reforms. Allows Medicare to
negotiate the price of certain prescription drugs; limits the
price growth of certain drugs paid covered under Medicare to
inflation; repeals the implementation of a ``rebate rule''
scheduled to increase drug-related Medicare outlays beginning
in 2027; redesigns Medicare Part D benefit formula and caps
out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries.
IRS funding. Appropriates approximately $80 billion over
the next decade for IRS enforcement activities including the
hiring and training of new auditors, IT systems
modernization, and taxpayer services.
Table 1 presents PWBM's estimate of conventional budgetary
effects over the 10-year budget window defined in the FY2022
reconciliation instructions. We estimate the Act would reduce
cumulative noninterest deficits by $264 billion from FY2022
through FY2031.
estimated effects on inflation
We estimate that the Inflation Reduction Act as passed by
the Senate would have a very modest impact on inflation over
the next decade. The Act produces some upward pressure on
prices in 2023 and 2024, but its effects are too small to
meaningfully affect measured the Personal Consumption
Expenditures (PCE) inflation rate as reported by the Bureau
of Economic Analysis. The Act would reduce annual inflation
by around 0.1 percentage points in about five years, once
major deficit-reducing provisions of the legislation are
fully implemented, but the Act would have no measurable
impact on inflation after 2028. All these point estimates are
not statistically different from zero, indicating a low level
of confidence that the legislation would have a measurable
impact on inflation.
other macroeconomic effects
Government spending rises because of the climate-related
spending and the extension of the ACA subsidies are greater
than the savings from prescription drug pricing reforms.
However, additional tax revenues are greater than the
spending increases, which leads to a decrease in government
debt. Government debt goes down by 4.1 percent in 2040 and 8
percent in 2050, which crowds-in investment in productive
private capital.
The provisions which increase taxes on business activity
lower the after-tax return to investment, which offsets the
positive effects on investment from lower government debt.
Net of these two effects, private productive capital declines
by 0.2 percent in 2031, is unchanged in 2040 and increases by
0.3 percent in 2050. The drop in productive capital in 2031
leads to a 0.1 percent decline in GDP.
Nonetheless, as government debt declines, private capital
increases by 0.3 percent by 2050, and workers become more
productive. Higher worker productivity is reflected in wages
that increase by 0.1 percent in the same year. Moreover, the
increase in private capital combined with the accumulated
productivity increases from the climate and energy effects,
described in a previous brief, leads to an increase in GDP,
which grows 0.1 percent in 2050.
distributional tax effects: conventional estimates
The Inflation Reduction Act contains a wide array of
subsidies, taxes, and pricing reforms, each with varying
impacts on households and businesses. For example, some large
businesses would face higher tax bills; individuals buying
certain health insurance plans would face lower out-of-pocket
costs; some households who evade taxes would be made to pay;
and pharmaceutical companies would earn lower revenues.
Though not responsible for remitting taxes assessed on
business activity, households bear some of the economic
burden of such taxes. Shareholders receive lower after-tax
returns, and workers earn lower wages with fewer productivity-enhancing
investments.
Distributional analysis traditionally focuses on the
effects of revenue-raising tax provisions since attempting to
allocate all spending--including for roads, education,
national defense, some transfer programs, and the bill
inherited by future payers for current deficits--is
challenging and subjective. Put differently, distributional
analysis typically is not intended to be a holistic
incidence. Instead, distributional analysis attempts to
estimate answers the narrower question: for a given set of
spending benefits
[[Page H7671]]
and change in debt, who finances the costs under the
explicitly stated revenue provisions in the bill? In the case
of this Act, the revenue is raised from the corporate minimum
tax as well as the tax on share repurchases.
Conventional distributional analysis measures the long-run
incidence of tax increases imposed at a single point in time.
PWBM assumes that 75 percent of corporate income taxes are
borne by owners of capital with the remainder borne by
labor--magnitudes consistent with empirical research and
scorekeeping convention. We apply this incidence assumption
when analyzing the corporate minimum tax provision. However,
for the stock buyback tax, we assume that shareholders bear
100 percent of the burden because it is assessed on a
discretionary balance sheet transaction rather than on income
from economic production.
We find that all income groups would bear some of the
additional burden of the 2023 revenue-raising business tax
changes. Average burden ranges from $5 for the lowest
quintile, to $55 for the middle quintile, to $61,520 for the
top 0.1 percent of tax units. At lower incomes, the tax
incidence largely reflects lower wages over time relative to
baseline, whereas at high income the tax incidence mostly
reflects more immediate changes in the value of financial
assets.
distributional effects: dynamic estimates
PWBM's dynamic distribution metric shows how benefits and
costs accrue across generations when accounting for
macroeconomic effects, including the increase in productivity
from lowering carbon emissions relative to baseline. While
this analysis is less granular than conventional
distributional analysis, the dynamic ``equivalent variation''
measure captures important dynamics like lifetime income
trajectories, the ``insurance value'' of means-tested
benefits and changes in wages and returns to capital
investments.
Table 4 reports the equivalent variation for households at
different ages (relative to the year 2022) and incomes. Each
value shown in Table 1 corresponds to the one-time benefit
that the corresponding household receives from the
legislation. For example, the value of -$700 for a household
age 40 in the bottom income quintile indicates that this
household is worse off by $700 under this legislation,
including at age 40 and the remainder of his or her lifetime.
Put differently, this household is indifferent between the
adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act and making a one-time
payment of $700 that avoids the adoption of the Act. However,
a household in the bottom quintile who is born in 20 years
(-20 age in 2022) would be $1,900 better off.
Notice two main effects that vary by both income and
generation:
First, current workers and retirees prefer current law over
the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. People alive
today bear the burden of business tax increases in the form
of lower investment returns and lower wages in the near term.
However, future generations gain from the adoption of the
Act, including positive gains to capital formation from
reducing the debt as well as the increase in total factor
productivity from reducing carbon emissions relative to
baseline.
Second, current higher-income households bear a
substantially larger share of the tax burden while future
higher-income households also gain the most from the improved
economy. In the long run, the Inflation Reduction Act leads
to lower government debt, higher wages, higher total factor
productivity and higher GDP. Although older workers and
retirees prefer current law, this growth leads to significant
gains for younger households in all income brackets. As lower
government debt crowds in additional productive private
capital, wages increase. In addition, these younger workers
begin to benefit from the accumulating productivity benefits
from climate investments. Therefore, workers in the future
will receive higher wages and income, which is reflected in
larger equivalent variations for younger cohorts of workers.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. Rose).
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, Tennesseans are hurting from the
skyrocketing cost of living everywhere they turn. Now, it seems as if
the United States has entered into a spending-induced recession caused
by the irresponsible fiscal policies of President Biden and
congressional Democrats.
Instead of focusing on passing meaningful and impactful legislation
to help lower the cost of living, we are voting on a bill that spends
hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars.
The bill will do nothing to help ease the pain my neighbors in
Tennessee are experiencing and, in fact, is likely to increase
inflation even more and push prices on everything even higher.
It gives a tax break to wealthy Americans who can already afford to
purchase expensive electric cars. It also increases taxes amidst a
recession, which will only make it worse, and it allows the IRS to hire
an army of 87,000 new Federal agents to go after the middle class.
Madam Speaker, I will be voting ``no,'' and I urge my colleagues to
do so as well.
{time}  1400
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip of the Democratic
Caucus, whose district I have visited.
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the
time.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in full support of the Inflation
Reduction Act. There are few days during a congressional career that
feel truly historic. For me this is one of them. We have passed other
historic legislation to help our economy overcome the pandemic, create
jobs, repair and invest in our infrastructure, and bolster critical
supply chains. Passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, however, will
lead to the transformative change Democrats in Congress have been
working with President Biden to achieve for the past year and a half.
The Inflation Reduction Act will check inflation by reducing the
deficit by $300 billion over the next decade. It achieves that by
ensuring tax fairness that requires corporations to pay a minimum tax
of 15 percent and protecting families making less than $400,000 a year
from paying even one penny more in taxes.
In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act will assist families by
extending subsidies for the purchase of health insurance through the
Affordable Care Act. Seniors on Medicare will benefit from the
government's ability to negotiate prescription drug prices and by
capping out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 per year.
Having experienced my late wife's 30-year battle with diabetes, I am
especially pleased this bill would cap insulin costs at $35 per month
for those on Medicare.
This is a giant step forward, but we will continue working to
overcome the Republican opposition that blocks extending the same
lifesaving measures to those on private insurance.
Finally, this bill will cut climate pollution by 40 percent by 2030.
It does so by building a new, clean energy economy that invests in a
healthy future for all our citizens, creating more than 9 million new
jobs.
This legislation creates a nuclear production tax credit for existing
reactors, ensuring that my home State of South Carolina continues to be
a leader in clean energy generation while also making electricity
affordable and accessible.
It also puts $60 billion toward environmental justice to help
communities, especially communities of color, address the legacy of
pollution in their neighborhoods.
I believe today we are demonstrating what we Democrats mean when we
say we are putting people over politics, while our Republican
colleagues continue to put their politics over the people's health and
well-being.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand with the people of America and
help with this bill.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I would note that every Democrat in
Congress, in the House and Senate, strongly opposed providing
prescription drugs for seniors in Medicare part D, and then-Leader
Pelosi at the time said, it would end Medicare as we know it to help
seniors with these lifesaving medicines.
Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following study from the
University of Chicago which shows the Democrats' drug pricing scheme
and controls could kill up to 342 cures, many of them lifesaving cures,
in the next two decades alone.

The Evidence Base on the Impact of Price Controls on Medical Innovation
(By Tomas J. Philipson and Troy Durie)
Executive Summary
This issue brief reviews the evidence on the impact of
price controls on biopharmaceutical innovation and calibrates
what this evidence implies for recent price control proposals
in the US. A large academic literature estimates the effect
of future drug revenues on R&D spending with a mid-range
effect of a 1 percent reduction in revenue leading to a 1.5
percent reduction in R&D activity. Using the range of such
effects found in the literature we find the proposed price
controls of US bill HR3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, would
lead to a 29 to 60 percent reduction in R&D from 2021 to 2039
which translates into 167 to 342 fewer new drug approvals
[[Page H7672]]
during that period. The mid-range effect of the evidence
implies a 44.6 percent decline in R&D and 254 fewer new drug
approvals. As a benchmark on the large size of the adverse
health effects this implies, we conservatively find the loss
in life from the price controls the next 10 years is 20 times
larger than the loss from COVID-19 to date in the US. We
argue this is a conservatively low estimate of the impact of
such proposals even though it is as much as a ten times
larger reduction in new drugs compared to a recent CBO
analysis.
Section 1: Introduction
A national debate has emerged again about the effect of
price controls on pharmaceutical innovation. Many proponents
of price controls for pharmaceutical drugs argue that they do
not impact innovation while opponents argue they will lead to
fewer new drugs. This issue brief attempts to provide insight
into the likely effects of recent price control proposals by
analyzing how the debate can be informed by basic economics
and the prevailing empirical evidence.
While the United States has less stringent price
regulations when compared to other nations, the Biden
Administration has recently announced plans to lower drug
prices through policies similar to those outlined in a recent
bill referred to as the Lower Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3)
that passed the House of Representatives in December 2019 and
was reintroduced in April 2021. This proposal would create
price controls for the government's highest expenditure drugs
and then apply price controls to firms conducting private
sector transactions. This issue brief reviews the evidence on
how sensitive innovation is to changes in revenues and
applies the evidence to estimate the effect of proposed price
controls.
Section 2: Evidence Base on Revenue Effects on Innovation
Biopharmaceutical companies routinely project future market
size and profits for their products to determine the rate of
return on investment (ROI) from R&D. A large body of evidence
suggests that these market practices translate into a
predictable positive relationship between realized revenues
and R&D spending in the economy in general and for biomedical
innovation in particular.
A rich academic literature quantifies this relationship
between future revenues and pharmaceutical innovation. For
assessing evidence related to revenue effects on R&D, it is
important to recognize that global profits drive innovation
and that revenues from different countries have different
effects on those global profits because of different profit
margins across countries. Expected earnings, not revenues,
drive R&D investments. Therefore, decreases in US revenue
will have larger effects on global profits than revenue
losses in price controlled markets in Europe due to higher
profit margins in the US. Goldman and Lakdawalla (2018) find
that pharmaceutical profits in the United States accounts for
64 to 78 percent of global profits, similar to an estimate
from the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) (2018).
Consequently, the evidence finds that studies focusing on US
revenue losses show larger R&D effects than those studying
revenue losses in Europe.
In particular, a set of papers looks at the expansion of
the Medicare prescription drug benefit, Medicare Part D,
which provides the most relevant evidence for assessing the
revenue effects of Medicare policy changes. They find that
companies recognized this expansion and increased innovation
in drugs treating diseases prevalent in the elderly
population more so than innovation in non-elderly diseases
(Blume-Kohout and Sood 2013). Quantifying that relationship,
a 1 percent increase in market size due to Medicare Part D
leads to a 2.8 percent increase in new drug approvals.
Another often cited paper finds a 1 percent increase in
potential market size leads to a 4-6 percent increase in the
entry of new drugs (Acemoglu and Linn 2004) in the US. Though
other studies have found lower effects in Europe of the
relationship between potential market size and the number of
new treatments, a clear strong positive relationship exists
(Dubois et al. 2015). Other studies show that a 1 percent
increase in price leads to a 0.22-1.33 percent increase in
innovation. Another extensive literature illustrates how
companies change their investments in lower quality drugs due
to price controls and other regulations that decrease how
much can be charged for high-quality drugs.
We synthesized the evidence base by computing the average
R&D elasticity with respect to revenue estimated from 10
different studies looking at the effect of a price change,
expected market, and overall revenue on R&D. Table 1
illustrates the elasticities used from each paper, and the
average elasticity across these 10 studies is 1.54.
Note: Acemoglu and Linn (2004) find an elasticity range of
4-6 based on if all approved including generics are included
or not. We take the midpoint of this range. Abbott and Vernon
(2005) find a price cut of 40 to 50 percent lowers R&D by 30
to 60 percent. Taking the midpoint of these numbers gives a
45 percent price cut leads to a 45 percent decrease in R&D,
or an elasticity of 1.
To assess the impact on the number of new drugs from
reductions in R&D spending, a common approach is to divide
the reduction in R&D spending by an estimate of the costs of
bringing a drug to market. This is a useful approach and
implies a proportional reduction in new drugs to the
reduction in R&D spending regardless of the particular cost
per drug. In other words, using this methodology, a 10
percent reduction in R&D spending leads to 10 percent fewer
drugs regardless of the cost per drug estimate used. The
elasticity of R&D spending with respect to revenue in this
case therefore also represents the elasticity of new drugs to
revenue.
Despite the evidence, there is some debate among law makers
concerning whether revenue or price controls affect
innovation at all. However, the evidence is consistent with
common market practices of biopharmaceutical innovation--a
positive relationship between investment and earnings. Such
market practices include the use of net present value (NPV)
calculations to determine a new drug's ROI. Biopharmaceutical
companies determine the demand for new drug therapies by
analyzing the prevalence of disease, insurance coverage of
the population affected by the disease, and reimbursement by
payers managing patients' care. The pharmaceutical industry
spent more than $91 billion on R&D in 2020. In obtaining such
R&D funding, companies have relied on venture capital
funding, licensing agreements, or mergers and acquisitions as
well as their own revenue. All rely on ROI assessments to
evaluate R&D investments. Indeed, markets routinely assess
the enterprise value of firms by estimating the present value
of expected cash flows across all business lines and
projects.
section 3: Calibration of the Impact on Innovation of Proposed US Price
Controls
This section evaluates what the evidence implies for the
innovation effects of proposed US price controls. We
calibrate that the price controls implemented in the United
States would lead to a 29.2 to 60.0 percent reduction in R&D
from 2021 to 2039. This equates to $952.2 billion to $2.0
trillion in lost R&D spending and 167 to 342 fewer new drug
approvals during this period. This means annual new drug
approvals will be 11.7 to 24.0 percent lower per year from
2021 to 2029 and 45.0 to 92.4 percent lower from 2030 to
2039. We discuss how these findings, as well as findings from
other studies, differ from CBO (2019), which finds only 37
fewer new drug approvals over this time period, which is
550.2 to 1,024 percent lower than our estimates. Our
estimates are conservative as the entire evidence base is
considered and not only the evidence base for the more R&D
sensitive US market.
It should be noted, however, that making comparisons to CBO
estimates is made more difficult due to the highly non-
transparent discussion of their underlying analysis, which
makes third-party replication of their results impossible.
This ``black-box'' nature of analysis is often the case with
government reports and raises larger issues with the
difficulty for private parties and taxpayers--who funded the
analysis--being able to assess their accuracy. In contrast,
we believe the presentation of the evidence discussed above,
and the innovation effects they directly imply, is highly
transparent as it simply documents the findings of the
studies and their implied effects.
3.1 The Proposed US Price Controls
The United States has fewer restrictions on price than
other countries, but the Biden Administration has announced
their goal to lower drug prices through greater price
regulation, as set forth in a recent bill referred to as H.R.
3. This proposal would change the way certain single-source
brand drugs are priced for Medicare beneficiaries by
requiring drug manufacturers to ``negotiate'' drug prices
with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. A
prohibitive excise tax of 65 to 95 percent will be applied to
a company's annual gross sales if they refuse to negotiate,
making the requirement largely equivalent to mandatory price
controls. Drug prices set by the Secretary may not exceed the
prices in specified countries by more than 20 percent and
price increases would be capped at the rate of inflation (CBO
2021).
In addition, these price controls would also be extended to
private transactions by employer-based plans as stated on
August 12, 2021 by President Biden and as implied by the
proposed legislation. Private payers can choose the lower
prices negotiated by the government, which they presumably
will.
3.2 CBO's Estimated Effects and Alternative Estimated Effects
of the Proposed Price Controls
CBO (2019) previously estimated that a drop in future
revenues due to H.R. 3 would lead to 8 fewer drugs from 2020
to 2029, which would then expand to 30 fewer drugs from 2030
to 2039). In August 2021, CBO (2021b) updated its estimated
impact of price negotiations to be 2 fewer drugs in the first
decade (0.5 percent), 23 fewer in the second decade (5
percent), and 34 fewer drugs in the third decade (8 percent).
Since the development process takes about a decade, the long
run effects of the bill will be larger than its short-run
effects. To align these estimates with our time period of
2021-2039, we lower their estimate to 7 fewer drugs from 2021
to 2029 and keep the estimate of 30 fewer drugs from 2030 to
2039.
Consistent with our analysis, other analysts' assessments
of CBO's 2019 analysis of H.R. 3 conclude that CBO (2019)
likely underestimates the impact of H.R. 3. Charles River
Associates (2021) finds the CBO study underestimates the
company revenue impact by assuming companies will be able to
set their price at the high end of the allowed price
[[Page H7673]]
range, and that companies will be able to increase their non-
U.S. price. Both assumptions may not be true due to
uncertainty around behavioral responses in negotiations.
Further, for the loss-of-revenue impact on R&D, CBO
extrapolates price control effects from smaller markets, and
they do not account for the larger impact on targeted disease
groups most impacted by the policy like rare diseases and
oncology. CBO's analysis relies on Dubois et al. (2015) to
estimate the effect of H.R. 3 on R&D, but CRA notes that this
estimated effect is smaller than most of the other
literature, too dependent on specific assumptions, and may
not be as relevant to a policy of H.R. 3's magnitude.
Other analysts' estimates of the impact of the price
controls introduced in H.R. 3 show a considerably larger
impact on global revenues and R&D than assumed by CBO.
Stengel et al. (2020) estimate drug manufacturer revenues
would fall 34 to 44 percent, which would equate to about $1.3
to $1.7 trillion in total lost global revenues from 2020-
2029. Vital Transformation (2021) estimates annual earnings
would fall 56 percent, or on average $102 billion a year,
starting in the year 2024. This fall in earnings when fitted
to past data would have lowered new approved drug therapies
in their sample from 68 new drugs to 7 new drugs, an 89.7
percent decline from 2010 to 2019.
3.3 Effects of the Proposed Price Controls Implied by the
Evidence Base
In light of the reported shortcomings in the CBO (2019)
report, we used the broader evidence base discussed in this
issue brief to assess the effect H.R. 3's proposed price
controls would have on innovation. We create a range of the
estimated drop in global drug manufacturer revenues by taking
the CBO's lower estimate of 19 percent and the midpoint
revenue effect of alternative studies, 39 percent, from
Stengel et al. (2020).
As discussed earlier, a conservatively low estimate of the
elasticity of revenue on either R&D or the introduction of
new drugs is 1.5 based on current evidence. We apply this
elasticity to the 19 to 39 percent decline in revenues to
derive a percentage reduction in R&D. This percentage
reduction is thereafter used to calibrate the reduction in
absolute R&D spending or number of approved drugs which is
applied to the CBO baseline trend in absolute values. In
other words, the reduction in R&D spending and the number of
new drug approvals during 2021 to 2039 is obtained by
determining how much would be lost in each of those measures
with the number of approved drugs being compared to CBOs
baseline trends given the percent reduction in R&D. We create
our own trend for R&D spending by taking a time series from
PhRMA's 2021 Membership Survey showing pharmaceutical R&D
spending from 2000-2019 and calculated the compound annual
growth rate to get a trend for expected R&D spending through
2039. We then applied the impact on R&D to each year and
summed these values to get a total. For new drug approvals,
we use the 30 new drug approvals baseline from CBO (2019) and
applied the impact on R&D for each year and summed.
Table 2 illustrates our main findings. Using the average
elasticity on the 19 to 39 percent drop in global revenues,
innovation through R&D is expected to drop 29 to 60 percent.
Using the middle of our range, this would equate to lost R&D
spending of up to $1.5 trillion. We find that this drop in
spending will lead to 167 to 342 fewer new drug approvals.
Our estimates are therefore 550.2 percent to 1024.0 percent
larger than CBO (2019)'s estimated 37 fewer new drug
approvals, adjusted to our time period. CBO (2019) points out
that lower R&D spending will take time to be reflected in new
drug approvals due to the long development process, so the
reduction in revenue results in 7 fewer new drug approval,
18.9 percent of their total estimate, in the first 9 years
and 30 more in the following decade, 81.l percent of their
total estimate. We assume this breakdown as well, so new drug
approvals will fall by 32 to 65 approvals from 2021 to 2029
and 135 to 277 approvals from 2030 to 2039. These significant
drops in new drug approvals will lead to delays in needed
drug therapies, resulting in worse health outcomes for
patients.
The failure to discover and get new drug approvals leads to
worse health outcomes. CEA (2019) did an early analysis of
H.R. 3 finding 375 million to 100 million life years lost due
to this policy's impact on R&D spending through 2029. For
comparison, using death data through September 22, 2021,
SARS-CoV-2 has directly reduced health outcomes by 7.5
million life years. The 7.5 million life years lost is only
just over 10 percent as large as the midpoint of CEA (2019)'s
estimate due to H.R. 3. We calculate this loss in life years
by applying life expectancy estimates conditional on age from
CDC to the age distribution of deaths from SARS-CoV-2 from
CDC updated through September 22, 2021. Then we multiply the
life expectancy at each age grouping by the number of deaths
and sum to get 7.5 million life years lost. A prior study
shows how every $2,000 spent on pharmaceutical research and
development increases population health by one statistical
life-year (Lichtenberg 2002). When applied to our R&D
spending estimates, this would lead to 159.3 million to 326.9
million life years lost by 2029 which increases to 476.1
million to 977.2 million by 2039. This amounts to the direct
negative health effects of SARS-CoV-2 to be only 3.1 percent
as large as our midpoint estimate by 2029 and 1.0 percent as
large by 2039. Price controls have significant health costs
to the U.S. population.
Our analysis likely underestimates true innovation effects,
which, if considered fully could make our findings even
further away from the CBO estimates. This is because the
average R&D elasticity of 1.5 used included studies of non-
U.S. markets with lower earnings effects than U.S. markets.
Given that the U.S. has higher margins, price controls are
expected to have a larger impact on earnings. Thus, only
using the larger estimated elasticities from U.S. markets,
which would double the elasticity of 1.5, would yield
proportionally larger differences between the evidence base
and the CBO estimates.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. Rutherford).
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this reckless
spending bill, which, contrary to its name, will do absolutely nothing
to address inflation. In fact, the bill before us today will further
threaten the prosperity of hardworking, middle-class taxpayers.
The same leaders who drove this economy into a recession are back.
But this time, it is another failed plan to raise taxes, build more
bureaucracy, and create a government slush fund with taxpayer dollars.
We need to call this bill what it is. It is a $700-billion debacle
that will drive up costs for everyone, double the size of the IRS,
attack medical innovation, as you have already heard, and use $350
billion to implement the Green New Deal all while giving handouts to
the wealthy.
Hardworking Americans across the country are facing the reality of
rising prices and a nationwide recession. They deserve leaders who are
focusing on the lives of everyday Americans, not politicians who pander
to the President and his failed policies.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this egregious bill.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, the word
``historic'' is probably overused at times. Really, it is a day like
today when the word ``historic'' is warranted.
For decades, politicians of both parties talked about giving Medicare
the ability to negotiate prescription drugs to bring down the costs for
seniors. Today, in this bill, we are doing it.
For decades, politicians talked about capping the amount of money
seniors paid every year on prescription drugs. Some in my district in
Philadelphia pay $5,000 a year, $10,000 a year. This bill caps it at no
more than $2,000 a year.
Again, for decades, politicians talked about the need to address
climate change and to make a large investment, so that we can finally
tackle this existential challenge for America and for the world. Here
in this bill we are doing it: the largest single investment to address
climate change in our Nation's history.
I know that on social media and on TV, it tends to be the
performative politics that get most of the attention, that helps breed
cynicism within our constituents. It is legislation like this that
makes a difference in people's lives. This is why we are here as
lawmakers: to do the people's business.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I insert in the Record the following
analysis which shows the top 10 manufacturing industries hit hardest by
the Democrats' made-in-America manufacturing tax. These are
predominantly minority communities and working-class Americans.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. Davidson).
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, this bill will not reduce inflation. It
will pull us deeper into the current recession and take America further
in the wrong direction. It is simply more government and less freedom.
In the past year, inflation has exceeded 13 percent, and real wages
have effectively fallen by 4.5 percent. The Federal Reserve and Big
Government combined to fuel inflation, and now people are being crushed
by these high prices. You cannot spend your way out of inflation.
But that is exactly what this bill tries to do with $745 billion in
new spending. It raises taxes in a recession. And it gives more than
six times the agency's current annual budget for the IRS. It is going
to more than double audits on families.
Instead of addressing the 32 percent increase in energy prices by
increasing domestic production, this bill spends billions on Green New
Deal pet projects like a $27 billion EPA-run Climate Bank and a $250-
billion federally run Department of Energy loan program.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues, please oppose this bill.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. Beyer), who has had a profound influence on this
legislation and knows it inside and out.
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, today we protect the world for future
generations.
Madam Speaker, the Inflation Reduction Act will do untold good for
the Nation and for the American people. This is our generation's
signature contribution to American history, our Social Security Act, or
Civil Rights Act, or even the Bill of Rights.
The act will lower healthcare costs, reduce prescription drug prices,
and create jobs. We have emphatically put people over politics.
Much like a proposal I introduced with Senators Elizabeth Warren and
Angus King, it will actually reduce the deficit by preventing tax
avoidance for the biggest corporations in this country, requiring them
to shoulder their fair burden of the tax responsibility.
Most importantly, Congress is finally taking the sweeping, ambitious
action we desperately need to prevent the worst effects of the climate
crisis. We are passing the most important environmental bill in
history.
I am privileged to serve on Chairman Neal's brilliant and enlightened
Ways and Means Committee. I am proud of the diverse tax credit
provisions I partnered with my distinguished Members and friends.
These are the parts of the act which will have enormous climate
consequences:
They will accelerate the adoption of zero emission mid-size trucks,
vans, and other commercial vehicles.
They will scale up direct air capture technology to remove carbon
pollution directly from the atmosphere.
They will incentivize the reduction of emissions from commercial
buildings.
These provisions and the bill as a whole will create huge numbers of
good-paying jobs.
Then there is the big picture. This bill will put us on a path to
reduce our target emissions and actually help save the planet.
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following
editorial from The Wall Street Journal, which shows this bill will only
reduce global temperatures by, at best, 0.028 degrees Fahrenheit
throughout this century and as little as 0.0009 degrees over the entire
century.
[From The Wall Street Journal]
Tilting at Climate Windmills
Nearly all of Washington--Democrats, the press, lobbyists--
is taking a victory lap with Senate passage of the Schumer-
Manchin tax, climate and drug price control bill. The climate
lobby is especially thrilled, claiming a historic victory
that will reduce temperatures, hold back the rising sea, and
save the planet.
Or, maybe not. Our contributor Bjorn Lomborg looked at the
Rhodium Group estimate for CO2 emissions reductions from
Schumer-Manchin policies. He then plugged them into the
United Nations climate model to measure the impact on global
temperature by 2100. He finds the bill will reduce the
estimated global temperature rise at the end of this century
by all of 0.028 degrees Fahrenheit in the optimistic case. In
the pessimistic case, the temperature difference will be
0.0009 degrees Fahrenheit.
In other words, the climate provisions in this ballyhooed
legislation will have no notable impact on the climate.
This isn't surprising. No matter what the U.S. does to
reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, it will be dwarfed by what
the rest of the world does. China, India and Africa aren't
about to stop burning fossil fuels as they develop, and China
is sprinting ahead to build huge new coal capacity despite
its pledge to start reducing emissions after 2030.
Barring a breakthrough in battery or other technology,
carbon emissions will continue to increase. No one knows how
much the Earth's temperature will warm, though even the U.N.
model has modified its estimates from the apocalyptic
predictions of some years ago.
Schumer-Manchin won't reduce inflation, won't reduce the
budget deficit, and it won't reduce the world's temperature.
What it will do is transfer some $369 billion from taxpayers
and drug companies to the pockets of green energy businesses
and investors. It will tighten the hold that politicians have
on the allocation of capital, as they pick winners and losers
with their grants and tax credits. Everyone will get a nice
warm feeling as they pretend they are cooling the climate.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from
New York (Ms. Malliotakis).
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, at a time when the country is facing
a 40-year high rate of inflation, Americans are struggling, the economy
is contracting, and we are in a recession, they are jamming through a
$750-billion bill with a slush fund that will only further fuel
inflation, lead to higher energy costs, and drive up manufacturing
costs as a supply chain crisis persists.
What a lousy idea to raise taxes during a recession. This will not
just hit businesses, but families earning as little as $50,000, and
that is exactly why this bill is doubling the IRS by 87,000 agents.
This is a level that is:
More than the population of Biden's entire hometown of Scranton,
Pennsylvania.
More than the fans that can fill the MetLife Stadium where the Giants
play.
Three times the staff at the Pentagon.
Four times the Border Patrol agents when we have a border crisis; and
Eight times the drug enforcement agents when fentanyl is taking
record lives of young Americans.
This bill does not include one cop as crime is skyrocketing in cities
like mine.
This Congress is disconnected with the real problems that Americans
face. To call this the Inflation Reduction Act is a lie.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Schneider), who is a very valued member of the Ways and
Means Committee.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I proudly rise today in support of the
Inflation Reduction Act. This historic bill will lower the cost of
energy and healthcare for millions of Americans. Just as important, it
makes the largest ever investment in tackling the climate crisis,
helping us cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030.
These historic investments will improve the lives of hardworking
Americans, all while reducing our deficit by $300 billion.
This bill will allow the HHS Secretary to negotiate the prices of
some of the most expensive drugs. It caps the price of insulin at $35
for Americans on Medicare. It also includes expanded coverage for low-
income Medicare beneficiaries, which I have championed for years.
On climate change, I am particularly proud that this bill includes my
legislation, the Sustainable Skies Act, that will help dramatically
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, which today accounts for
2 percent of the world's annual emissions.
The bill also tackles the high energy costs that Americans face with
investments in consumer home energy, from rooftop solar panels to
electric HVAC systems.
Let me repeat: this bill is entirely and responsibly paid for and
then some.
Again, our deficit will be cut by more than $300 billion by the
action Congress is taking today.
Madam Speaker, Americans have been hard hit by a once-in-a-century
pandemic and then by the consequent effects of global inflation and
supply chain crises. And every year the impacts of climate change
become more severe and more costly. Americans need relief.
[[Page H7675]]
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Inflation
Reduction Act and give our fellow citizens the relief they deserve.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following
article by Americans for Tax Reform, which debunks the Inflation
Reduction Act by describing the top five budget gimmicks in this bill,
showing over $330 billion in fake savings, more than the so-called
deficit reduction in the bill.
5 Gimmicks in Democrats' Reconciliation Bill
Democrats' reconciliation bill, improperly named the
``Inflation Reduction Act,'' contains numerous gimmicks
designed to deceive voters and circumvent congressional
rules.
This bill uses several budget gimmicks: a short extension
of Obamacare subsidies, a repeal of the ``rebate rule'' that
never has nor never will go into effect, and supersizing the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to ``solve'' an overstated tax
gap, This bill attempts to circumvent the Byrd rule by
erroneously calling a mandate ``a tax.'' The bill would also
violate President Biden's tax pledge to not raise taxes on
anyone making less than $400,000 a year.
1. The Obamacare subsidies in this bill are only extended until 2025,
despite expectations that they will be extended again.
In the American Rescue Plan (ARP), President Biden and
congressional Democrats expanded Obamacare subsidies--
specifically the advanced refundable premium tax credit--by
increasing benefits for households at every income level and
expanding them to households earning more than 400 percent of
the federal poverty level. Because these enhanced benefits
are set to expire later this year, Democrats are attempting
to extend them through 2025 in this legislation.
Once these expanded subsidies have been in place for five
years total, it will be extremely difficult to get rid of
them. Given the high likelihood--and expectation--that these
subsidies will be extended once they're set to expire again,
the three-year extension is a clear gimmick.
If the expanded subsidies were extended indefinitely, the
10-year budget deficit reduction falls from $248 billion to
$89 billion, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model.
2. The bill repeals the ``rebate rule,'' despite the fact that it was
never going into effect.
Under the Trump administration, the HHS released the rebate
rule which sought to lower drug prices by altering payments
from drugmakers to pharmacy benefit managers. The Trump
administration never went through with this rule nor has the
Biden administration taken it back up again (to be clear,
they never will).
Even so, Democrats claim the repeal would reduce the
deficit by $120 billion. Clearly, it would not.
Already, between the likely extension of Obamacare
subsidies and this rebate rule, the bill doesn't actually
reduce the deficit at all.
3. The IRS would be supersized to solve an overstated ``tax gap.''
The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that $80 billion
in additional funding to the IRS would increase tax revenue
by $125 billion. While increasing tax enforcement would
certainly raise more money from unsuspecting small
businesses, the Left has assumed that this can and will be
done through increased enforcement on the wealthy.
In reality, wealthy individuals and large corporations are
almost always tax compliant. The wealthy and large
corporations already have armies of lawyers and accountants
that ensure they legally take advantage of the plethora of
credits and deductions offered by the tax code. Further, the
IRS already audits the largest corporations at high rates. It
doesn't matter how much more the agency receives in funding--
they will not find violations in the law that do not exist.
Thus, the IRS won't find much more revenue from their big
targets.
Additional funding will instead be used for invasive, time-
consuming, and non-fruitful audits of middle-class Americans
and small businesses. The IRS previously announced a goal to
increase small business audits by 50 percent.
As previously reported by CNBC, experts say a fattened-up
IRS would go after small businesses that necessarily depend
on cash transactions.
4. The bill implements price controls through a 95 percent tax,
The bill would give the Health and Human Services Secretary
the authority to ``negotiate'' the price of prescription
drugs on behalf of Medicare. By ``negotiation,'' Democrats
mean drug manufacturers will pay a 95 percent excise tax on
prescription drug profits unless they accept price controls
set by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In
2023, the Secretary would be able to determine the prices of
10 prescription drugs. The determined price would go into
effect in 2026. The number of drugs the HHS Secretary could
set prices for would then increase to 15 in 2028 and 20 in
2029.
That tax itself is forecasted to raise zero revenue.
Neither the JCT analysis nor any independent analyses
estimate that any company would pay this exorbitant tax. A 95
percent ``tax'' on revenue is just a stick to enforce a
mandate for government price controls. This is a way to
circumvent the Byrd rule, which requires that all the
provisions in a reconciliation bill directly change federal
spending or revenue. While a tax is obviously protected under
this rule, it's not clear that mandates of this kind are.
5. The reconciliation bill raises taxes on those making less than
$400,000, violating President Biden's tax pledge.
Throughout the ten-year window, the JCT estimates that
nearly every single income group will see their taxes raised.
Those Americans making less than $200,000 will see their
taxes raised by nearly $17 billion. For those making between
$200,000 and $500,000 (as the JCT doesn't cut off brackets at
$400,000), their taxes would increase by another $14 billion.
Senate Finance Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) rightly
points out that at least half of all new tax revenue raised
by this bill would come from those earning under $400,000.
Clearly, this tax hike violates President Biden's pledge
not to raise one penny of taxes on any American earning less
than $400,000 per year.
If Biden and Harris want to keep their pledge, they must
veto the bill or instruct Democrats to change the bill.
Mr. BRADY. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.
Fleischmann).
{time}  1415
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speaker, the dying ember that is the
Democratic majority in both Houses once again seeks to burn the
American people. $80 billion for the IRS, and they champion it.
I will stand with the hardworking American people of this Nation.
Democrats, you can have the IRS.
Raising taxes at a time of recession, at a time of economic gloom, I
will stand with the hardworking entrepreneurs of America any time over
raising taxes.
Madam Speaker, the American people know better. The American people
deserve better. The American people will get better in November. I urge
a ``no'' vote on this bill.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the very capable
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).
Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this
historic legislation.
The climate crisis is the single-most important issue facing our
future, the future we will all share, Democrats and Republicans.
I understand this is a down payment on climate action and more needs
to be done, but let's focus on what this bill does. It lowers the cost
of healthcare and prescription drugs. It lowers energy costs and
delivers the largest-ever climate action by investing in domestic
energy production and manufacturing while reducing carbon emissions by
roughly 40 percent by 2030. It lowers the deficit and helps fight
inflation by making a historic payment on deficit reduction of $300
billion. We do this by making the biggest corporations and ultrawealthy
pay their fair share in taxes.
Enough with the fear-mongering by the other side. Let's get this done
on behalf of hardworking families across America.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I include the following polling reality
study in the Record, which shows that once Americans learn the details
of the so-called Medicare negotiation, which is price setting, that
their choices and access to lifesaving cures will be limited, public
support for negotiation plummets.
Analysis: Americans Don't Support Surrendering Innovation for
Democrats' Drug Price Controls
Democrats are selling their socialist drug pricing scheme
as a way to lower prices, but Americans oppose it once they
learn that this kills cures and life-improving treatments.
What they aren't telling you is this: Their drug price
control scheme will kill innovation, mean fewer new
treatments and cures, and a loss of jobs in the biopharma
industry.
Once Americans learn about these consequences they reject
it outright. Furthermore, this isn't a ``negotiation''--
Democrats' proposal has Washington dictate prices under
threat of exorbitantly higher taxes on medical innovators.
Key Takeaways:
The vast majority of Americans oppose government negotiation
if it results in fewer new medicines being developed in
the future
A 50-state Morning Consult/PhRMA poll shows two thirds of
Americans oppose price controls if they put the government in
[[Page H7676]]
charge and take away power from doctors to prescribe
medicines that best meet the needs of patients.
The Kaiser Family Foundation also finds that Democrats'
price control scheme drops in popularity the moment
respondents see that it could lead to less research and
development of new drugs or limit access to newer
prescription drugs.
A March 2022 Ipsos/PhRMA poll reveals only 14 percent of
Americans support Washington price controls if they limit
their access to newer prescription medicines. Even if it
``only'' delays access, only 15 percent support the proposal
then.
The same poll shows that seniors are even more skeptical--
10 percent support the price controls when they learn of how
it delays people's access to new medicines.
Numerous studies show the proposal would kill new treatments,
including a University of Chicago study that shows the
number going up to 342
Democrats' price-fixing scheme would kill up to 342 cures,
according to a study by the University of Chicago, yet they
claim it's merely a ``negotiating'' approach that would lower
the price of drugs.
A new study from Vital Transformation finds that if drug
price controls under consideration in the Senate had been
enacted during the last decade, only six of 110 currently
approved therapies would have made it to patients.
Loss of innovation = a death sentence for patients. Looking
at CMS drug utilization data from 2016 to 2020 of the types
of drugs expected to be most impacted by Democrats' price
fixing, even the most conservative estimates of innovation
lost from these policies could have left over 42 million
patients without the medicine they needed.
Surrendering in the fight against cancer: The Council of
State Bio Associations writes that socialist drug price
controls will get in the way of the fight against cancer:
``In oncology alone, the University of Chicago found that
price controls would reduce overall annual cancer R&D
spending by about $18.1 billion, or 31.8 percent.''
They continue: ``The specter of government price setting
threatens to undermine a sector that has created over 1.8
million jobs across all 50 states and that represents a large
portion of our nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)--
generating an economic output of approximately $2.6 trillion
annually.''
Limiting patients' access to low-cost medicines: Back in
March, medical innovators wrote to Congress that ``The
untested approach in the House-passed Build Back Better Act
(H.R. 5376) does not address these challenges and could in
fact harm future savings from generic and biosimilar
medicines. The Build Back Better Act's approach to direct
negotiations in Medicare and inflation-based penalties, as
passed by the House, would alter the incentive for generic
and biosimilar manufacturers to develop new medicines [. . .]
and is misguided and would limit patients' access to low-cost
medicines.''
The Bipartisan Solution That Works: The Lower Costs, More
Cures Act (H.R. 19) lowers costs for all prescription
drugs
Every provision in H.R. 19 is bipartisan. It will lower
health care costs and ensure America leads in health care
innovation for more cures and treatments.
It gives patients more drug price transparency and ensures
public disclosure of drug costs and discounts.
It increases low-cost options by bringing more generic and
biosimilar competition to the marketplace fast.
It caps seniors' out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $50 per
month.
It allows high deductible health insurance plans to cover
insulin before the deductible kicks in.
A new large-scale survey of 20,000 Americans covering all
50 states and 435 Congressional districts shows a majority of
Americans find health care coverage costs unreasonable and a
priority health care issue for policymakers to address today.
The survey also shows that a majority of voters in every
state and district oppose Medicare ``negotiation'' once they
learn the policy could harm access and innovation.
Here are the key findings from the survey:
A majority of Americans in every state and the District of
Columbia oppose government ``negotiation'' as a way to
address health care costs if it could:
Take away power from doctors to prescribe the medicines
that best meet the needs of their patients, and instead put
the government in charge of those decisions--on average 66%
oppose.
Limit people's access to newer prescription drugs--on
average 64% oppose.
Reduce access to medicines for seniors and people with
disabilities--on average 62% oppose.
Americans concerned with rising health care costs believe
Congress should prioritize reducing the overall cost of
coverage:
30% of Americans, on average, are concerned with out-of-
pocket costs not covered by insurance and 29% are concerned
with the cost of health insurance premiums.
66% of Americans, on average, believe Congress should focus
on reducing the overall cost of health care coverage, (23% of
Americans want them to focus on prescription drug costs, and
13% don't know enough to say).
66% of Americans from all states and Congressional
districts, on average, find their out-of-pocket health care
costs ``unreasonable.''
Americans are clear in their opposition to so-called
Medicare ``negotiation'' policies. They want Congress to
focus on patient-centered solutions that address the real
health care issues they face, like rising out-of-pocket costs
and health insurance premiums, while preserving access,
innovation and choice. Learn how at PhRMA.org/BetterWay.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. Gohmert).
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, this is the bill, 728 pages, that we got
from the Senate this week. Has anybody read it?
Come on. That is over a billion dollars average per page. That ain't
gold; that is fool's gold.
Look, more IRS agents, as Art Laffer said years ago, that is not
going to increase the amount of revenue to the government, and, in
fact, when you say it is going after the ultrarich, what happens is the
ultrarich are the only ones that can avoid paying taxes. They can hire
attorneys, accountants. They can move, change their business structure.
It comes right back to the middle class every time.
These same policies are the reasons that the average Black household
in the 8 years of Obama lost 30 percent of their net worth.
We keep hearing from the other side that there is this runaway
inflation, and this ugly bill is going to stop it. Well, our President
said it is zero percent inflation. Somebody is lying. We will find out
who.
Mr. NEAL. I will be the first to acknowledge that, Madam Speaker. I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, on behalf of many diabetes patients, I
include the following article in the Record, which includes a quote
from my fellow Texan, Representative Lloyd Doggett, where he accurately
states that the insulin caps policy included in this bill ``does not
lower the price of insulin by one penny,'' but, rather, shifts costs to
others.
Insulin Copay Cap Passes House Hurdle, But Senate Looks for a Broader
Bill
(By Michael McAuliff)
The chances of passing election-year legislation to help
people afford insulin--which weeks ago seemed mired in
political fighting--are looking brighter as a bipartisan
effort to tackle the issue takes root in the Senate.
That effort is still in the early stages, but it is moving
forward with the support of Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer, who tapped Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Jeanne
Shaheen (D-N.H.) to craft a compromise that members of both
parties could accept. Adding pressure to the Senate's efforts
was a vote by the House on March 31 to pass a different bill
that caps out-of-pocket insulin costs for many patients with
insurance at $35 a month.
Collins said in an interview March 30 that the two senators
had come up with an outline based on a bill they worked on
three years ago that goes beyond capping what diabetes
patients pay and aims to bring down the prices drugmakers
charge.
``It tackles the broader issue of the high list price for
insulin, and the conflicts of interests that occur in the
chain from manufacturer to the consumer buying it at the
pharmacy counter,'' Collins said.
The idea of reducing patients' out-of-pocket insulin costs
is immensely popular, and more than half of the public sees
it as a ``top priority'' for Congress, according to a KFF
poll out last week.
It had been a key selling point of President Joe Biden's
Build Back Better plan, but when that legislation stalled,
Biden and Schumer gave Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) an open
lane to promote a stand-alone measure identical to the House
bill that caps insulin costs at $35 a month for people with
private insurance and Medicare coverage.
The political climate, however, presented roadblocks. The
odds that a bill sponsored by a Democrat facing a tough
reelection in the fall could get enough Republicans in the
Senate on board seemed slim, and even some Democrats were
nervous about stripping the insulin provisions from a
possible revised version of the Build Back Better bill. So
Schumer embraced a different option from Collins and Shaheen
that would include a cap on out-of-pocket costs and possibly
draw more votes.
Insulin prices have spiked dramatically since the early
2000s, with Americans paying 10 times what people in other
developed countries pay.
Although Collins said details are still being worked out,
her legislation would be based on the pair's earlier bill,
the Insulin Price Reduction Act of 2019, which aimed to roll
insulin costs back to what they were in 2006. It would have
done that by barring rebate payments for insulin to pharmacy
benefit managers--those intermediaries who negotiate price
breaks for insurance companies and determine which drugs the
insurance plans cover.
Collins and other critics of PBMs believe they inflate
prices because they favor higher-priced drugs from which they
can extract a larger rebate and therefore more profit, which
gives drugmakers extra incentive to raise list prices.
[[Page H7677]]
Under that 2019 plan, drug manufacturers who agreed to
return to 2006 costs could then raise prices each year only
at the rate of medical inflation. The senators estimated the
plan would lead to a 75 percent cut in prices from those
listed in 2020.
``There's a very complex system which essentially
encourages high list prices, because the pharmacy benefit
managers frequently receive a percentage of the list price,''
Collins said. ``So their incentive is to choose one that is
higher-cost. And so we are trying to address that broader
issue, as well as looking at the out-of-pocket costs.''
Warnock's proposal to cap the cost of insulin is silent on
list prices and benefit managers, an omission some Democrats
complained about even as they voted for the similar bill in
the House. They noted that since insurers would likely be
forced to absorb the costs no longer paid by patients, the
companies would likely raise premiums.
``This bill does not lower the price of insulin by one
penny,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas). ``It just shifts
the burden of paying for the insulin off of the shoulders of
insured insulin users, and shifts it on to the rest of all of
us who are paying insurance premiums.''
Collins also noted that the uninsured would not benefit
from the House cap, which applies to Medicare and insurance
companies but doesn't affect drugmakers' prices.
``It doesn't help someone who's uninsured,'' Collins said.
``When you address the high list price, then it's going to
help more people.''
Collins warned that much could change as lawmakers keep
working with various stakeholders on a final bill, including
diabetes advocacy groups, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services, and the Congressional Budget Office. And as caps on
out-of-pocket expenses and list-price changes start
interacting, things get complicated, indeed.
``We're talking to CBO, which says it's so complex that
they need a new model,'' Collins said.
The politics also remains tricky. Collins and Shaheen never
got their measure close to the Senate floor in 2019 and 2020
when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was majority
leader. They did attract some praise from both sides of the
aisle, and conservative North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin
Cramer was a co-sponsor.
While that opens the door to GOP support, Collins said she
was still only at the stage of circulating among her
colleagues what she called a discussion draft.
Republicans in the House who voted against the $35-cap bill
panned it as a political stunt, saying Democrats should have
advanced ideas that had been worked on with Republicans.
Such objections could not block the bill in the House. But
in the Senate, Democrats command only 50 votes, and it would
take 60 to pass the legislation.
Although GOP members of the upper chamber might also be
opposed to Warnock's bill, one of the House sponsors argued
that having the House advance a dramatic cut in insulin
costs--with the support of only a dozen Republicans--would
raise the stakes for the Senate.
``If 10 Republicans stand between Americans being able to
get access to insulin or not, that's a good question for 10
Republican [senators] to have to answer when they go back
home,'' Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said ahead of the House
vote. ``So we're gonna pass this bill, and this will put the
pressure on the Senate to act.''
He and his fellow Democratic co-sponsors also signaled
their willingness to take a measure that included the Shaheen
and Collins additions.
``Any train that's leaving the station that gets folks
affordable insulin--I'm open to any vehicle,'' Kildee said.
``We think this is a solution that would work. How it gets to
the president's desk, I'm agnostic on that question. Any way
we can get it there.''
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. Jordan).
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, who are they going to harass? Who are
these thousands of IRS bureaucrats, leftwing bureaucrats, Lois Lerners
at the IRS, who are they going to harass? Middle-class families.
We know who it is going to be. It is that assistant football coach at
the local high school who teaches history and who has this side
business. He mows lawns in the summer. He paints houses in the summer.
He pays his taxes, but he is going to get harassed.
We know how this works. We have seen it before.
This bill raises taxes. It creates a whole new bureaucracy to go
after taxpayers. Such a deal, using your tax money to come after you,
the taxpayer. Such a deal for the taxpayer.
My guess is they will all be working remotely. They won't have to pay
the $5 to drive to work like people in our districts do. They will be
working remotely, drinking their fancy coffee, going after the guy who
is helping kids and has this side business in the summer. That is who
this is going to come after, and we all know it. Everyone knows it. The
country knows it.
This is disgusting. I hope y'all vote ``no.''
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, on behalf of seniors who rely on generic
drugs, I include in the Record the following letter from generic and
biosimilar manufacturers, which explains the price controls in this
Democrat bill will reduce competition from lower-cost generic and
biosimilar medicines. That means fewer options for patients and
worsening drug shortages.
The Biosimilars Council,
Washington, DC, July 11, 2022.
Hon. Charles E. Schumer,
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
Dear Leader Schumer: The Association for Accessible
Medicines (AAM) and its Biosimilars Council share in the goal
of lowering prescription drug costs for America's patients
and seniors. However, in an effort to target high prices on
brand-name drugs, the proposed prescription drugs reforms--in
particular the Medicare negotiations framework--being
considered as part of a revised reconciliation package will
reduce patient savings from lower-cost generic and biosimilar
medicines. Even though competition from generic and
biosimilar medicines is the only proven solution to
consistently lower the cost of prescription drugs, the
proposed price setting scheme will reduce competition, harm
future savings from generic and biosimilar medicines, and
increase costs for employers and patients with private
insurance. We thus urge all U.S. Senators to oppose the
prescription drug reforms under consideration as part of a
revised Build Back Better reconciliation package.
America's patients rightfully expect Congress to address
the ever-increasing prices of brandname prescription drugs.
High launch prices on new brand biologics, combined with an
increasing trend of anti-competitive patent and rebate ploys
designed to delay or prevent competition from more affordable
biosimilars and generics, are keeping access to medicines out
of reach for too many patients. These dynamics are compounded
by flawed policies that reward health plans and pharmacy
benefit managers (PBMs) for the use of high-cost, high-rebate
brand drugs and that allow plans and PBMs to raise out-of-
pocket costs for generics, even as the prices for those same
generics are falling. As a result, patients, including
Medicare's seniors, are missing out on billions of dollars in
savings from biosimilars and generic drugs each year.
However, the proposed price setting approach fails to
adequately address these challenges, while dampening future
competition and reducing savings from generic and biosimilar
medicines.
Negotiations Framework Increases Uncertainty for Generic and Biosimilar
Developers
The proposal increases the risks associated with developing
generic and biosimilars without addressing the fundamental
barriers to competition from lower-cost medicines, such as
abuses of the patent system and brand rebate traps. The
proposed timelines for when the Secretary can initiate the
price setting process will significantly increase the risk to
develop new lower-cost generics and biosimilars. Although the
proposal exempts drugs with generic or biosimilar competition
from the price setting process, the bill only does so through
unrealistic timelines for that competition to enter the
market. For many complex generics and biosimilars, it can
take 8-10 years to develop new, more affordable medicines.
And it can take many more years to conclude patent litigation
and then launch a complex generic or biosimilar medicine. But
the new price setting process would not begin until years
after a developer commits to developing a lower-cost generic
or biosimilar. This means that generic and biosimilar
manufacturers will have no way to know whether a brand-name
drug will be selected for negotiation or what the negotiated
price may be. This dynamic fundamentally changes the ability
of generic and biosimilar manufacturers to plan and make
investment decisions that can be up to and exceed $250
million per drug.
While the revised bill includes a provision that could
allow for a temporary delay of the negotiated price if the
Secretary determines a biosimilar launch was imminent, there
are a number of limitations on the provision make it
difficult to utilize. By way of example, a biosimilar
developer would need to show a ``high likelihood'' of
biosimilar competition by a ``clear and convincing''
evidentiary standard. Moreover, the narrow two-year window to
launch does not appropriately account for how long it takes
developers to challenge brand-name patents. Large patent
estates and time-consuming patent litigation are currently
and will continue to prevent biosimilars from being able to
launch within two years of receiving FDA approval. These
dynamics will likely deter manufacturers from making
investments in biosimilar and generic medicines in some
instances--and will result in less competition and ultimately
higher costs for patients.
Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Savings Exceeds Potential from
Negotiations Framework
After years of high-risk investment, biosimilar developers
are poised to deliver tremendous savings to the U.S. health
care system, improving access for patients and lowering
prescription drug costs. New
[[Page H7678]]
biosimilars are expected to launch for a range of treatments
for patients with diabetes, arthritis, macular degeneration,
oncology and more. In the next few years, 42 biosimilars are
on track to launch. Gold-standard data firm IQVIA estimates
biosimilar savings of $30 billion annually as a result. In
comparison, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the
negotiations framework saves $18-24 billion per year from
2028 to 2031. Thus, more savings is projected from market-
based competition than from the Build Back Better proposal
and it starts now. In addition, as more complex generics,
biosimilars, and interchangeable biologics become available,
there is the potential for even greater savings to the U.S.
health care system as providers and payers take advantage of
the opportunities to increase access and reduce costs for
patients.
Negotiations Framework Increases Costs on Employers and Patients with
Private Coverage
Reduced competition from generic and biosimilar medicines
impacts all patients, not only Medicare beneficiaries. The
dampening effect this legislation would have on competition
would cause employers and patients with private insurance to
lose savings these populations have historically enjoyed from
robust generic competition and growing biosimilar
competition. Instead, there may be fewer new, more affordable
generic and biosimilar medicines, leaving the commercial and
employer markets captive to the high cost of brand-name
drugs.
When reviewing a nearly identical proposal in the House-
passed Build Back Better Act, AAM's Biosimilars Council
assessed the potential lost savings to the commercial market
for medicines used to treat asthma (Xolair) and rheumatoid
arthritis (Orencia), as examples. For just two products, lost
savings would be between $4-$7 billion between 2027-2030.
This is lost savings that would otherwise be used to lower
patient out of pocket costs and reduce insurance premiums for
employers and employees.
For these reasons, we must oppose the Medicare negotiations
framework and its impact on patient access to lower-cost
medicines. There are other bipartisan steps to address patent
abuse and brand rebate traps that are already under
discussion in Congress that can meaningfully reduce drugs
costs without harming generic and biosimilar savings. We
strongly encourage Congress to reconsider its approach.
Sincerely,
Dan Leonard,
President and CEO.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, following   Jim Jordan is like why
nobody wanted to follow Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. It is going to be
tough.
But you never reduce burdens or inflation by increasing taxes $740
billion. It is estimated that there is a $4,500 increase on the average
family under this proposal. Instead, you simply create more government
that never goes away.
This is not an inflation reduction act. It is a woke climate bill
that will increase inflation, Madam Speaker.
Madam Speaker, my Democrat friends seem to have forgotten that
capitalism is not the enemy; we are.
I would also remind my colleagues across the aisle that, in
Tennessee, we reduced taxes and regulations, and now we have record
surpluses. Individuals and businesses are moving from your district to
mine as fast as they can get there.
Madam Speaker, the ranking member, who I call chairman, will be
incredibly missed here in these Halls, but also more so out on the
baseball field.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
I include in the Record the following list of 586 credible voices of
opposition to this bill. They include business leaders, taxpayer
advocates, economists, and thought leaders who all say this bill will
hurt Americans if passed today.

Mr. BRADY. I include in the Record the following letter from dozens
of Main Street businesses opposing the Democrats' bill because of the
IRS' targeting of their business under the bill and tax hikes on small
businesses.
August 11, 2022.
Hon. Nancy Pelosi,
Speaker of the House,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. Kevin McCarthy,
House Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. Charles Schumer,
Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
Hon. Mitch McConnell,
Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Leader Schumer, and
Leader McConnell: The undersigned organizations represent
millions of Main Street businesses and employ tens of
millions of workers and we oppose the Senate-passed Inflation
Reduction Act.
Inflation is at 40-year highs, we have had two consecutive
quarters of negative economic growth, and we are witnessing a
shrinking small business sector, yet the Inflation Reduction
Act does nothing to address these immediate issues even as it
increases the burden of the tax code shouldered by America's
small and family-owned businesses.
The Biden Administration claims the savings in the IRA are
``front-loaded'' and will reduce the deficit in the short-
term, helping to ease inflationary pressures. That is simply
not the case. Recent analysis by the Congressional Budget
Office, Penn-Wharton, and others shows the Inflation
Reduction Act would increase prices in the short term and do
little to bring them down in the long run.
At the same time, the bill would give the IRS an additional
$80 billion in funding, more than half of which would pay for
thousands of additional IRS agents to conduct millions of
additional audits. We support addressing the tax gap and
oppose illegal tax evasion, but as former National Taxpayer
Advocate Nina Olson observed recently, it is wrong and
counterproductive to characterize the entire tax gap as
willful tax evasion. From experience, we know many, if not
most, of these additional audits will be conducted on the
owners of family businesses who have fully complied with the
tax code.
Finally, the Warner Amendment adopted at the last minute
presented the Senate with a clear choice between Wall Street
and Main Street, and the Senate chose Wall Street. The
amendment extends for two years the Section 461(l) cap on
losses a business owner is permitted to claim. This $52
billion tax hike on pass-through businesses was adopted with
almost no consideration, and the revenues it raises were used
to offset the cost of exempting private equity investors from
the fifteen-percent corporate minimum tax. The cap on active
pass-through less deductions is bad policy at any time, but
it is particularly harmful when the economy is weak and an
increasing number of businesses are suffering losses. The
timing of this amendment's adoption could not have been
worse.
The Inflation Reduction Act would fail to reduce price
pressures even as it raises the cost of the tax code to small
and family-owned businesses at a time of economic weakness.
We ask that you reject the IRA's Main Street tax hike when it
is considered by the full House.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, a year ago, we met to consider another
disastrous version of this bill. Since then, American families and Main
Street businesses have been facing and continue to face historic
inflation and, now, a recession.
This bill is a hoax on the American people. Americans who are
suffering the most in President Biden's cruel economy will soon know
this firsthand. They will know it because inflation will get worse,
according to the Penn Wharton School of Business analysis.
Parents sitting up at night will notice higher taxes, fewer jobs, and
lower wages as they pay for the vast majority of any new revenue
collected under this bill, according to Congress' own nonpartisan
scorekeeper.
A middle-income single mom with two kids who runs her own business
will know it when she comes home from Walmart and finds a letter from
the IRS telling her she is under audit.
Seniors and loved ones with life-threatening illnesses will arrive at
the pharmacy counter and break into a sweat when they see they cannot
afford their medicine.
Families with loved ones newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's, or cancer,
or ALS, and desperately seeking treatment will wonder whether the cure
for their disease will ever come.
The wealthiest and the biggest foreign-owned corporations will do
just
[[Page H7680]]
fine. They are getting hundreds of billions of dollars of government
handouts under this bill. After all, they get the government checks
paid for by the middle-class taxpayers who are getting squeezed.
This is a sad day for struggling American families and Main Street
businesses. This economy is cruel enough, but by voting to turn this
hoax into law, Congress is inflicting one more act of cruelty.
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
This is a big day, and this is a big deal. We are putting people out
front and making good on the promises we have made, lowering drug
prices and investing in our climate.
A mountain-high pile of legislative achievements have we: the
American Rescue Plan, the CHIPS and Science Act, and now this
achievement for the American people.
Lyndon Johnson was right: ``Yesterday is not ours to recover, but
tomorrow is ours to win or lose.''
With the Inflation Reduction Act headed to the President's desk--and
give Joe Biden credit--we stand here assured that tomorrow is ours to
win.
We have had bold dreams in this Congress, and we have delivered big
on those dreams. None of this would have been possible without the
dedication and expertise of the staff of the Ways and Means Committee,
the best in the business. They have worked nonstop for 2 years for the
American people, and today, their hard work is on display for the world
to witness and await the President's signature.
The Inflation Reduction Act sets our Nation on a healthier, fairer,
and more prosperous path.
Madam Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support this critical
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone)
and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) will each control 30
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5376, the Inflation
Reduction Act. This is landmark legislation that is going to help
reduce costs for American families while finally aggressively tackling
the climate crisis.
Madam Speaker, we simply cannot wait any longer to confront the
climate crisis. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and
more extreme. There are record-high temperatures across the Nation this
summer. These extreme weather events cost families their loved ones,
their homes, and their livelihoods.
This bill is the single largest investment in climate action in
American history. We heard from the Ways and Means Committee about the
tax credits, the investment production tax credits for renewables, for
electric vehicles. I want to talk about the provisions from the Energy
and Commerce Committee.
The bill makes unparalleled investments in climate, clean energy, and
environmental justice so that we can slash climate pollution and meet
our aggressive climate goals.
I want to highlight some of the things: a methane emissions reduction
program, a greenhouse gas reduction fund to promote new green
technology, investing in manufacturing that is green, reducing
industrial emissions; a program for States and government entities to
reduce climate pollution, a program for clean heavy-duty vehicles for
trucks and school buses to make them less polluting, an appliance and
building efficiency rebate to try to deal with emissions from buildings
and appliances, an industrial emissions reduction program;
environmental and climate justice block grants, and also provisions to
deal with ports that are a major source of pollution.
All of these are designed, basically, to try to create clean jobs and
to reduce energy costs for the average family. We estimate it at about
$1,800 a year. It is estimated that this bill will actually reduce the
pollution of greenhouse gases into the climate by 40 percent, in terms
of what the U.S. has emitted since 2005.
It goes very far toward achieving our goals as a Nation, toward
reducing the problem of greenhouse gas emissions.
{time}  1430
In addition to that, the Inflation Reduction Act is also one of the
most significant pieces of healthcare legislation moved through
Congress in over a decade. I want to stress this: It breaks Big
Pharma's monopoly on prescription drug prices.
The bill will lower prescription drug costs for seniors by finally
empowering Medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs. It
also caps the amount that seniors pay at $2,000 annually, caps the cost
of insulin at $35 a month, and penalizes companies that unfairly hike
prices by forcing them to pay a rebate to the Federal Government if
their prices rise more than inflation.
This legislation is necessary because, nearly 20 years ago,
Republicans prevented the Federal Government from negotiating prices
for seniors. So, today, we are finally leveling the playing field to
ensure seniors are no longer forced to choose between putting food on
their tables and their life savings.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.
Finally, I want to say that this legislation will also dramatically
lower the cost of healthcare for millions of Americans by extending
enhanced Affordable Care Act marketplace premium subsidies.
These enhanced subsidies are making a real difference for families,
delivering an average savings of $2,400 a year for a family of four.
They are set to expire at the end of the year, but this bill extends
them through the end of 2025.
Madam Speaker, this legislation lays the foundation for a cleaner,
more prosperous future for all Americans. I urge my colleagues to
support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5376, the
mislabeled Inflation Reduction Act.
This is another reckless tax and spending spree that is not being
accurately portrayed to the American people by Democrats.
Washington Democrats are trying to convince Americans that adding
more reckless government spending and raising taxes during a recession
will combat inflation. Even nonpartisan organizations say this bill
will have virtually no impact on inflation and at least half of the
expected tax revenue for next year is estimated to come from Americans
making less than $400,000 a year.
Americans will see more IRS audits because this bill gives the IRS
the ability to hire an army of new IRS agents. People should pay the
taxes they owe, but instead of an army of IRS agents focusing on
auditing low- to middle-income Americans, we need to put our resources
into hiring more Border Patrol officers to protect the border and stop
the flow of illicit drugs such as fentanyl.
More troubling parts of this bill are the healthcare provisions. I
strongly disagree with using Medicare money to pay for ObamaCare
subsidies for the wealthy. I introduced an amendment to keep Medicare
savings in Medicare, which is already at risk of insolvency in the very
near future. Unfortunately, House Democrats didn't even give this
amendment a chance to be considered.
While Democrats praise government price setting, or, as they call it,
negotiation, they fail to mention that such policies would lead to at
least 15 fewer drugs coming to market, according to the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office.
What are the 15 cures? Could it be the cure for Alzheimer's? Could it
be the cure for diabetes? It could be.
They also won't mention that the nonpartisan CBO said this bill will
lead to higher prices on new drugs.
Finally, Democrats are voting to give Secretary Becerra a $3 billion
slush fund to set drug prices, despite HHS botching the response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, including politicizing guidance that kept schools
closed and young children masked in Head Start programs.
How can anyone support giving billions of dollars in more
unrestricted authority to HHS that we know will lead to fewer cures for
our loved ones?
Let me be clear: We absolutely need to address the cost of
prescription
[[Page H7681]]
medication. In the Energy and Commerce Committee, there is a bipartisan
bill ready to go, H.R. 19, that could achieve this, but the Democrats
have repeatedly refused to bring the bill to the floor for a vote.
Our country is also facing an energy crisis created by President
Biden and Washington Democrats' war on American energy. Despite this,
the Democrats' solution is to double down on the nearly $400 billion to
be spent on far-left Green New Deal policies and impose billions of
dollars of tax increases on energy that will be passed to consumers.
Unbelievably, even as energy prices are at historically high levels,
they have included a new tax on natural gas and revived a tax on
petroleum products that will cost consumers tens of billions of
dollars.
I filed an amendment to exempt our defense bases from this natural
gas tax, but again, Democrats refused even to consider it.
Democrats want to create a $27 billion slush fund at the EPA for a
national climate bank to subsidize the solar energy that is heavily
dominated by the Chinese Communist Party and even spend $9 billion in
rebates for wealthy Americans to green up their homes with new
appliances and electric vehicles.
To conclude, this legislation not only crushes hope for patients and
their families living with devastating diseases that currently lack a
treatment or a cure, but it also significantly undermines our economic
and national security.
I cannot vote for the more appropriately named inflation expansion
act. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman
from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester), my neighbor from the State of
Delaware and a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of the
Inflation Reduction Act.
Oh, what a day in America. From lowering prescription drug prices for
seniors, to closing tax loopholes on the wealthiest corporations, to
making the largest investment in clean energy in history to tackle the
climate crisis, the Inflation Reduction Act will help improve the lives
of every single American. It will do it all while paying down the
deficit.
I am particularly proud that the bill includes my climate smart ports
provisions with my colleague, Ms. Barragan, which invests in ports
across the Nation, like the Port of Wilmington, allowing them to
upgrade their facilities, lower their carbon footprint, and create more
good-paying union jobs.
Madam Speaker, in a session of Congress that has already seen
remarkable landmark legislation passed, the Inflation Reduction Act is
the capstone of our efforts to deliver. With this bill, we continue to
put people over politics.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. Upton), the chair emeritus of the Committee on Energy and
Commerce, who is retiring. We are going to miss him.
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, does anyone actually believe this bill is
going to reduce inflation?
I didn't think so.
Those of you that know me know that I am not afraid to work across
the aisle on important legislation that helps Americans, whether it was
the 21st Century Cures Act, the CHIPS Act, the veterans' PACT Act, or
the infrastructure bill. Unfortunately, the bill that we are debating
right now was not created in that same bipartisan manner.
Our economy is in a fragile state as we emerge from this pandemic. We
have seen decades-high inflation that is crushing Main Street and
squeezing the middle class. Now is not the time to raise taxes to the
tune of over $16 billion on middle-income folks around the country.
The Inflation Reduction Act does nothing to fix the insidious
problems at the IRS. Instead, they are going to throw more than $80
billion to hire more agents who are going to be tasked with hounding
taxpayers who report passthrough business income through Schedule C and
Schedule E. These folks are, by and large, middle-income, family-owned
small business owners who busted their butts to keep their doors open
through the pandemic, and now we are sending the cavalry after them,
leading to higher compliance costs and time wasted that will increase
costs for all Americans.
The IRS needs to be focused on clearing the backlog of millions of
personal and business returns. I have literally helped hundreds of
constituents who have been waiting 1 to 2 years for their tax refunds.
With respect to inflation, a number of nonpartisan sources, including
some previously touted by supporters of this bill, have said that this
bill will cause inflation to increase over the first couple of years.
The energy sector has seen the brunt of this increase, with gas
prices climbing more than $2.30 a gallon and natural gas prices going
up close to double.
On Wednesday, I offered an amendment at the Committee on Rules that
would direct the bill not to go into effect until the Secretary of
Energy can certify that energy prices are below the costs of 2021.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.''
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Casten).
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, last November, our House delegation went
to Glasgow for the COP26 conference. We told the world that we were
back, that we had rejoined the Paris climate accord, and that we were
committed to building back better and committed to putting science over
politics. It felt pretty good.
But to be blunt, the world didn't believe us. As we sat at that press
conference, all of these reporters from Europe said: What about the
Senate? What about the filibuster? What if Republicans take over in the
midterms?
They had heard this song before. They admired our enthusiasm, but as
you know, Madam Speaker, they really didn't share it.
Today, we are going to prove them wrong. We are going to remind them
what the United States is capable of. We are about to pass the most
impactful climate bill ever. You all should be proud of that. You were
here to share this moment with us. We are on the path to reducing
CO
2
emissions by 40 percent by 2030. That is a really big
deal.
But it is only a start because 40 percent ain't enough. We have
reestablished U.S. credibility today, but we still have to establish
U.S. leadership. The measure of our success is not what we pass today;
it is whether the planet is cooler tomorrow.
Today, we remind the world and ourselves what we are capable of. I
hope we celebrate. But tomorrow, let's get back to work.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman
from California (Mr. Ruiz), a member of the Committee on Energy and
Commerce.
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, as a doctor, I have taken care of many
patients who put their lives and health at risk because they couldn't
afford their medication, patients who either ration their medicine or
didn't get a prescription filled at all.
I will never forget one woman who was so proud to tell me that she
was able to make her insulin last longer because she would only take
half a dose at a time in order to make it last. This is unacceptable.
No one should have to choose between whether to take their medicine
and put food on their table or between their health and not being able
to pay their bills.
That is why I support the Inflation Reduction Act, which will give
seniors the relief that they need from skyrocketing drug costs. It
ensures that people on Medicare with diabetes won't have to pay more
than $35 a month for their insulin. It requires the Secretary of HHS to
negotiate drug prices for expensive Medicare drugs, lowering costs for
seniors and people with disabilities, and it caps out-of-pocket
spending at $2,000 per year for Medicare part D.
These important steps will help ensure that all seniors have access
to lifesaving and health-saving medications, regardless of how much
money they have.
[[Page H7682]]
That is not all this bill does. This bill will make transformational
investments to combat climate change and reduce our carbon emissions.
It will push automakers to make their electric vehicle batteries with
domestic materials, like the lithium we are extracting at the southern
end of the Salton Sea in Imperial County.
With this bill and the lithium in my district, we can power our clean
energy future here in America with American materials.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. Burgess), my good friend on the Committee on Energy and
Commerce.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for
yielding.
Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter submitted by the
members of the House GOP Doctors Caucus.
Congress of the United States,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC, August 6, 2022.
Hon. Chuck Schumer,
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
Hon. Nancy Pelosi,
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Dear Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi: We write to express
our strong opposition to the government drug price control
policies in your reconciliation package. As medical providers
and Members of Congress, we are deeply concerned with the
harm these provisions will cause to patients across the
country.
The GOP Doctors Caucus has continuously worked to ensure
that physician practices can stay open to continue treating
patients. We have heard directly from providers that the cuts
proposed in this bill will jeopardize patient access to care.
According to Avalere, changes to the Medicare Part B
physician-administered drug reimbursement would lead to an
average cut of 39.8 percent for health care providers. The
confluence of these cuts, including the 0 percent payment
update, the reduction of the 4.5 percent Medicare conversion
factor, and the adoption of several changes to the Evaluation
and Management (E/M) Current Procedural Terminology codes,
threatens the sustainability of medical practices and will
lead to physicians closing their doors.
It is irresponsible to divert seniors' Medicare dollars to
pay subsidies to non-Medicare insurance companies, yet this
plan would do just that. The proposal will take ``savings''
from the drug price controls in the Medicare program to pay
for expanded health insurance subsidies under the Affordable
Care Act (ACA). This is money going to insurance companies
and their bottom line; this is not money going directly
towards care in any way. These expanded subsidies were
originally part of the inflation-creating American Rescue
Plan Act (ARPA). ARPA removed the income cap restricting
access to premium tax credits, opening the door to taxpayer-
funded subsidies for some of the wealthiest Americans. Some
families making more than $500,000 annually now have access
to expanded ACA subsidies, and they will continue to if this
proposal goes through. Robbing Medicare to enhance the profit
for insurance company shareholders and executives does
nothing to improve anyone's health. To us, this is
unconscionable.
If this plan is passed into law, millions of patients could
die waiting for new drugs and cures that will no longer be
developed in their lifetime. Government price controls have
consequences. The Congressional Budget Office has
conservatively estimated that 15 fewer drugs will be
developed over the next 30 years under this bill, Another
study found that only six out of 11 currently approved
therapies would have been brought to the market if this
framework were in place.
Any cure lost is one too many. As Members of Congress who
have been involved in patient care, we understand the real-
world impact that this will have on patients. Many of us have
treated patients with chronic and life-threatening diseases.
We've seen expensive surgeries and intensive inpatient care
be eliminated by the development of new therapies. This
development and innovation will all but go away, leaving
patients without hope for improved quality of life and long-
term savings.
We remain concerned that this proposal will also put the
government in control of Americans' medical decisions. This
is another clear example of a policy crafted by politicians
who have never seen a patient. The bill calls for a 95
percent excise tax if drug companies do not accept the price
government bureaucrats put in place. Top down, ``take it or
leave it'' government price negotiation isn't a negotiation
at all--it's government price fixing.
This reconciliation package under consideration applies
upward pressure on drug pricing. The bill subjects a company
to negotiation once its seven-year exclusivity expires. As a
result, companies could introduce drugs into the marketplace
with high list prices, causing premium increases for
healthier individuals enrolled in employer-sponsored plans.
In summary, this reconciliation package will have grave
consequences for patients and patient care:
This price setting scheme put forth in this bill will
endanger patient access to care by cutting provider
reimbursement on impacted Part B drugs by an average of forty
percent.
The bill does nothing to address other ongoing Medicare
provider payment cuts set to begin in 2023.
If this plan is passed into law, millions of patients could
die waiting for new drugs and cures that will no longer be
developed in their lifetime.
Government price controls have consequences, and one lost
cure is one too many.
This plan robs Medicare to pay subsidies to insurance
companies and other non-health related expenditures.
As medical providers in Congress, we urge you to recognize
the danger this proposal will have on patients. We can and
should work on a bipartisan basis to lower drug costs without
sacrificing the cures and treatments that will provide for a
healthier future.

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, this is a letter that explains how
healthcare policies included in the Inflation Reduction Act would
affect American patients. There are 21 healthcare professionals who
signed this letter.
It is remarkable that none of our concerns were considered--all were
ignored--not only as Members of the House and Senate but as healthcare
professionals, as well.
The point of the letter is that this legislation will do the exact
opposite of what the Democrats intend. Unfortunately, the legislation
will kill research and development, reduce quality of care, and
threaten patient access to lifesaving drugs.
Under this legislation, we are going to see changes to part B drug
reimbursements that will lead to an average of a 40 percent cut for
healthcare providers, doctors who provide care to Medicare patients in
their offices.
Currently, part B reimbursements for administering drugs in a
physician's office are a calculation based on the average sales price
plus 6 percent. Under this new system, part B payments to physicians
are going to be calculated off of the maximum fair price. It is an
attractive term, but no one knows what it means. It is yet to be
determined by whom? The Secretary of Health and Human Services. We have
all seen how trustworthy they have been over the past 2 years.
The current 6 percent average sales price add-on payments to
physicians, which is what doctors have come to rely on now to run their
practices, will be based on a significantly lower government-set price
versus the traditional market-priced ASP. This results in significantly
lower payments to physicians.
Now, Wednesday afternoon late, at the Committee on Rules, I offered
an amendment with Dr. Murphy to fix this problem. Unfortunately, that
was rejected on a party-line vote.
These payment cuts threaten the sustainability of medical practices
and will lead--let me say that again--will lead to physicians closing
their doors. When practices close, the patient need does not disappear.
Care will then shift to hospitals.
{time}  1445
This will ultimately lead to an increase in healthcare costs and a
decrease in the quality of care provided, and it will limit access to
treatments for patients across the country.
From experience working in private practice, I can attest that there
are significant consequences of consolidation. Here is the bottom line:
Democrats are using Medicare as a piggy bank to pay for other things.
What
[[Page H7683]]
other things? Oh, like subsidies to insurance companies. They want to
reward insurance companies and punish doctors. It makes no sense.
This legislation will do the exact opposite of what Democrats intend.
It is going to kill research and development. It is going to reduce the
quality of care. It is going to threaten patient access to lifesaving
drugs.
As the most senior doctor in Congress and someone who deeply cares
about the well-being of American patients, this bill is antidoctor and
antipatient. We will live to see the consequences of this after final
passage, I promise you that.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. Soto), another member of the Energy and Commerce
Committee.
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, we have been elected to Congress to solve
the greatest challenges of our time, and today, we are doing just that.
We are taking action to combat climate change.
We are taking action to lower drug prices for seniors with a $2,000
cap on out-of-pocket expenses.
We are taking action to keep ObamaCare affordable for millions of
Floridians.
We are taking action by increasing vaccine access with our HAPPY Act.
We are doing it all while reducing the deficit by over $300 billion
over the next 10 years.
We are lowering costs; we are fighting inflation; and we are saving
the planet. This is the largest investment to resolve the climate
crisis in our Nation's history. It will reduce carbon emissions by 40
percent by 2030.
When generations look back years from now, they will read that this
was a turning point. How many more category 5 hurricanes, how many more
massive wildfires, deadly floods, dried-up rivers, and record heat
waves do you need?
How many more seniors have to get sick or die because they can't
afford their medication?
How many more families have to be kicked off their health insurance?
How much longer before you all get it?
We are not waiting any longer. The Republicans' plan is to do
nothing. In contrast, we in the Democratic majority will lead. Today,
we will act. Today, we will do what is necessary to protect this
generation and the next.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an editorial from
The Wall Street Journal titled, ``Tilting at Climate Windmills,'' which
notes that the massive spending bill reduces global temperatures at the
most by 0.28 degrees.
[From the Wall Street Journal]
Tilting at Climate Windmills
Shumer-Manchin will have little effect on the world's temperature
(By Editorial Board)
Nearly all of Washington--Democrats, the press, lobbyists--
is taking a victory lap with Senate passage of the Schumer-
Manchin tax, climate and drug price control bill. The climate
lobby is especially thrilled, claiming a historic victory
that will reduce temperatures, hold back the rising sea, and
save the planet.
Or, maybe not. Our contributor Bjorn Lomborg looked at the
Rhodium Group estimate for CO2 emissions reductions from
Schumer-Manchin policies. He then plugged them into the
United Nations climate model to measure the impact on global
temperature by 2100. He finds the bill will reduce the
estimated global temperature rise at the end of this century
by all of 0.028 degrees Fahrenheit in the optimistic case. In
the pessimistic case, the temperature difference will be
0.0009 degrees Fahrenheit.
In other words, the climate provisions in this ballyhooed
legislation will have no notable impact on the climate.
This isn't surprising. No matter what the U.S. does to
reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, it will be dwarfed by what
the rest of the world does. China, India and Africa aren't
about to stop burning fossil fuels as they develop, and China
is sprinting ahead to build huge new coal capacity despite
its pledge to start reducing emissions after 2030.
Barring a breakthrough in battery or other technology,
carbon emissions will continue to increase. No one knows how
much the Earth's temperature will warm, though even the U.N.
model has modified its estimates from the apocalyptic
predictions of some years ago.
Schumer-Manchin won't reduce inflation, won't reduce the
budget deficit, and it won't reduce the world's temperature.
What it will do is transfer some $369 billion from taxpayers
and drug companies to the pockets of green energy businesses
and investors. It will tighten the hold that politicians have
on the allocation of capital, as they pick winners and losers
with their grants and tax credits. Everyone will get a nice
warm feeling as they pretend they are cooling the climate.
Mr. GUTHRIE. This bill will not do what those on the floor today have
said it will do.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.
Miller-Meeks).
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Guthrie for
yielding me time.
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act.
As a physician and former director of the Iowa Department of Public
Health, I am uniquely positioned to understand the true implications of
this bill and how this bill will affect both doctors and patients, and
rural Iowans are no exception.
Interestingly, I just heard my colleague talk about how families may
be kicked off their healthcare, and it doesn't seem to me that my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle cared about that when they
passed the Affordable Care Act and premiums rose dramatically.
Allowing the Federal Government to set limits on drug pricing will
limit competition and drastically reduce innovation within the
pharmaceutical industry. Innovation also comes even after FDA approval
to determine if drugs can be used for more than just their initial
purpose.
Additionally, narrowing the drug formulary by drug pricing through
Medicare and negotiations will end up taking medications that you may
already be prescribed and taking successfully, taking them off of the
formulary and not being covered.
Let me also illustrate, when Medicare part D went into effect, the
fact that there was not a negotiation by Medicare allowed generic drugs
as low as $4 a medication. That was tremendously helpful to millions of
seniors and continues to this day.
The United States is the leading developer of new drugs, but without
market competition, American companies will lose the incentive to
undergo cutting-edge research.
What does that mean to the average person? It means fewer cures for
rare diseases or debilitating diseases. Fewer cures, less treatment for
debilitating diseases.
Inevitably, the United States will become dependent on countries like
China for pharmaceutical research and development, and patients will be
limited in their options. Didn't we already see that through the
pandemic?
Additionally, this bill will extend ObamaCare subsidies enacted in
the American Rescue Plan, which do not have income restrictions. Rather
than helping those who are most in need, the wealthiest Americans will
continue to receive the largest average benefit.
This enormous spending package is bad for Iowans, bad for the
economy, bad for hardworking Americans, and bad for the future of
American innovation.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. Eshoo), who is the chair of our Health Subcommittee.
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I first thank the chairman of the Energy
and Commerce Committee, Mr. Pallone, for his leadership and all of my
colleagues on the committee who have worked so hard.
I think today is a hallelujah day, and I say this because two of the
greatest challenges facing our country are the following.
The climate crisis: This is the single largest investment to take on
the climate crisis head-on. I hear from children as young as first
graders in my district caring about this issue. Two years ago this
time, I had 77,000 evacuees from the wildfires in my congressional
district. Taking on the climate crisis is absolutely essential.
Seniors, the Medicare beneficiaries, we are changing their
prescription drug prices today because Medicare will be able to
directly negotiate and bring the prices down.
Cap insulin at $35 a month--Senate Republicans sabotaged that cap on
insulin for all Americans. I don't know how any politician can go home
and brag about that.
The out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries will not exceed
$2,000 a year.
We are investing in the IRS. My constituents have been waiting for
too
[[Page H7684]]
long for their refunds. Added staff is going to expedite the services
that the IRS and the American people need from the IRS.
Finally, deficit reduction--yes, America, this is paid for.
This is truly a hallelujah day. This is a red, white, and blue bill.
It is good for all Americans, and it will advance our collective future
of America.
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, our Nation has major challenges that have
kept me awake at night.
The clarion call from young climate activists concerned they won't
have a planet to grow old on. I've heard seniors describe their
inability to afford their prescription drugs.
Today, we change all this by the largest and boldest effort to
address climate change in American history. It honors our commitments
under the Paris Agreement by investing $369 billion in tax credits,
loans, and grants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by
2030.
For seniors, the Inflation Reduction Act reduces prescription drug
costs through policies developed by the Health Subcommittee I chair.
Over the past three years, we held six hearings focused on this
challenge.
The hearings brought forward the fact that our Nation has been held
back for 20 years by a law that prohibits Medicare from negotiating
directly with drug companies. Not anymore.
The bill also ensures Medicare beneficiaries won't pay more than
$2,000 annually for prescription drugs, and no more than $35 for
insulin every month.
This legislation also lowers health care premiums by strengthening
the Affordable Care Act to save an average of $800 per year for 13
million people.
Finally, the entire legislation is paid for by making billion-dollar
companies pay their fair share and lowers the federal deficit by more
than $300 billion.
Throughout my service in Congress, my top priorities have been to
grow our economy, make health care more affordable, and address climate
change. Today's transformative legislation meets these challenges, and
I urge my colleagues to vote for it.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. Castor), who chairs the Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, as chair of the Select
Committee on the Climate Crisis and as a mom, I am proud to say the
Inflation Reduction Act is a big climate deal.
This is the largest investment in clean energy and climate solutions
ever in U.S. history, and it comes at a crucial time.
We must urgently slash climate pollution to avoid the worst impacts
and to lower costs, create good-paying jobs, and build safer, more
resilient communities.
Today, I am optimistic that America will lead the world in solving
the climate crisis, and I thank the young people all across this
country who pushed us to take this historic step.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also good news for Floridians, as
Democrats will lower the costs of prescription drugs, empower Medicare
to negotiate drug prices, institute a $2,000 cap, and much more.
It is a big deal for the 2.8 million Floridians who purchase high-
quality health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. With these tax
credits, those policies will be more affordable.
Yes, this is good news indeed, a true people over politics moment for
all of our neighbors, their health, their pocketbooks, and the
obligation we have to our kids to provide a livable planet.
I thank Speaker Pelosi for her vision for the Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis, and I also thank Chairman Frank Pallone and my
colleagues for their inspiring work.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
This bill drives a massive build-out of unreliable wind and solar
power, not nuclear, not natural gas, and not baseload power.
I include in the Record a report from the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation, the authority on electric reliability, which
underscores the risk of blackouts from the oversupply of weather-
dependent energy.
[From North American Electric Reliability Corporation, May 2022]
2022 Summer Reliability Assessment
Key Findings
NERC's annual SRA covers the upcoming four-month (June-
September) summer period. This assessment provides an
evaluation of generation resource and transmission system
adequacy and energy sufficiency to meet projected summer peak
demands and operating reserves This assessment identifies
potential reliability issues of interest and regional topics
of concern. While the scope of this seasonal assessment is
focused on the upcoming summer, the key findings are
consistent with risks and issues that NERC has highlighted in
the 2021 Long-Term Reliability Assessment and other earlier
reliability assessments and reports.
The following findings are NERC and the ERO Enterprise's
independent evaluation of electricity generation and
transmission capacity and potential operational concerns that
may need to be addressed for the 2022 summer.
Summer Resource Adequacy Assessment and Energy Risk Analysis
Midcontinent ISO (MISO) faces a capacity shortfall in its
North and Central areas, resulting in high risk of energy
emergencies during peak summer conditions. Capacity shortfall
projections reported in the 2021 LTRA and as far back as the
2018 LTRA have continued Load serving entities in 4 of 11
zones entered the annual planning resource auction (PRA) in
April 2022 without enough owned or contracted capacity to
cover their requirements. Across MISO, peak demand
projections have increased by 1.7 percent since last summer
due in part to a return to normal demand patterns that have
been altered in prior years by the pandemic. However, more
impactful is the drop in capacity in the most recent PRA:
MISO will have 3,200 MW (2.3 percent) less generation
capacity than in the summer of 2021. System operators in MISO
are more likely to need operating mitigations, such as load
modifying resources or non-firm imports, to meet reserve
requirements under normal peak summer conditions. More
extreme temperatures, higher generation outages, or low wind
conditions expose the MISO North and Central areas to higher
risk of temporary operator-initiated load shedding to
maintain system reliability.
At the start of the summer, a key transmission line
connecting MISO's northern and southern areas will be out of
service. Restoration continues on a 4-mile section of 500 kV
transmission line that was damaged by a tornado during severe
storms on December 10, 2021. The transmission outage affects
1,000 MW of firm transfers between the Midwestern and
Southern MISO system that includes parts of Arkansas,
Louisiana, and Mississippi. The transmission line is expected
to be restored at the end of June 2022.
Anticipated resource capacity in Saskatchewan will be
strained to meet peak demand projections, which have risen by
over 7.5 percent since 2021. SaskPower is projected to remain
above their planning reserve margin threshold and have
sufficient operating reserves for normal peak conditions.
However, external assistance is expected to be needed in
extreme conditions that cause above-normal generator outages
or demand.
Drought conditions create heightened reliability risk for
the summer. Drought exists or threatens wide areas of North
America, resulting in unique challenges to area electricity
supplies and potential impacts on demand:
Energy output from hydro generators throughout most of the
Western United States is being affected by widespread drought
and below-normal snowpack. Dry hydrological conditions
threaten the availability of hydroelectricity for transfers
throughout the Western Interconnection. Some assessment
areas, including WECC's California-Mexico (CA/MX) and
Southwest Reserve Sharing Group (SRSG), depend on substantial
electricity imports to meet demand on hot summer evenings and
other times when variable energy resource (e.g., wind, solar)
output is diminishing. In the event of wide-area extreme heat
event, all U.S. assessment areas in the Western
Interconnection are at risk of energy emergencies due to the
limited supply of electricity available for transfer.
Extreme drought across much of Texas can produce weather
conditions that are favorable to prolonged, wide-area heat
events and extreme peak electricity demand. Resource
additions to the ERCOT system in recent years-predominantly
solar and some wind--have raised Anticipated Reserve Margins
above Reference Margin Levels and ease concerns of capacity
shortfalls for normal peak demand. However, extreme heat
increases peak demand and can be accompanied by weather
patterns that lead to increased forced outages or reduced
energy output from resources of all types. A combination of
extreme peak demand, low wind, and high outage rates from
thermal generators could require system operators to use
emergency procedures, up to and including temporary manual
load shedding.
As drought conditions continue over the Missouri River
Basin, output from thermal generators that use the Missouri
River for cooling in Southwest Power Pool (SPP) may be
affected in summer months. Low water levels in the river can
impact generators with once-through cooling and lead to
reduced output capacity. Energy output from hydro generators
on the river can also be affected by drought conservation
measures implemented in the reservoir system. Outages and
reduced output from thermal and hydro generation could lead
to energy shortfalls at peak demand. Periods of above normal
wind
[[Page H7685]]
generator output may give some relief, however, this energy
is not assured. System operators could require emergency
procedures to meet peak demand during periods of high
generator unavailability.
All other areas have sufficient resources to manage normal
summer peak demand and are at low risk of energy shortfalls
from more extreme demand or generation outage conditions.
Anticipated Reserve Margins meet or surpass the Reference
Margin Level, indicating that planned resources in these
areas are adequate to manage the risk of a capacity
deficiency under normal conditions. Furthermore, based on
risk scenario analysis in these areas, resources and energy
appear adequate.
Other Reliability Issues for Summer
Supply chain issues and commissioning challenges on new
resource and transmission projects are a concern in areas
where completion is needed for reliability during summer peak
periods. Assessment areas report that some generation and
transmission projects are being impacted by product
unavailability, shipping delays, and labor shortages. At the
time of this assessment publication, WECC-CA/MX, and WECC-
SRSG have sizeable amounts of generation capacity in
development and included in their resource projections for
summer. In Texas (ERCOT), transmission expansion projects are
underway to alleviate transmission constraints and maintain
system stability as the BPS is adapted to rapid growth in new
generation; delays or cancellations of transmission projects
can cause transmission system congestion during peak
conditions and affect the ability to serve load in localized
areas. Should project delays emerge, affected Generator
Owners (GOs) and Transmission Owners must communicate changes
to Balancing Authorities (BAs), Transmission Operators, and
Reliability Coordinators, so that impacts are understood and
steps are taken to reduce risks of capacity deficiencies or
energy shortfalls.
Coal-fired GOs are having difficulty obtaining fuel and
non-fuel consumables as supply chains are stressed. No
specific BPS reliability impacts are currently foreseen;
however, coal stockpiles at power plants are relatively low
compared to historical levels. Some owners and operators
report challenges in arranging replenishment due to mine
closures, rail shipping limitations, and increased coal
exports. Some GOs have implemented controls to maintain
sufficient stocks for peak months while BAs and Reliability
Coordinators are continuing to conduct fuel surveys and
monitoring the situation.
The electricity and other critical infrastructure sectors
face cyber security threats from Russia and other potential
actors amid heightened geopolitical tensions in addition to
ongoing cyber risks. Russian attackers may be planning or
attempting malicious cyber activity to gain access and
disrupt the electric grid in North America in retaliation for
support to Ukraine. The Electricity Infrastructure Sharing
and Analysis Center (E-ISAC) continues to exchange
information with its members and has posted communications
and guidance from government partners and other advisories on
its Portal. E-ISAC members are encouraged to check in
regularly to receive updates and to actively share
information regarding threats and other malicious activities
with the E-ISAC to enable broader communication with other
sector participants and government partners.
Unexpected tripping of solar photovoltaic
(PV) resources during grid disturbances continues to be a
reliability concern. In May and June 2021, the Texas
Interconnection experienced widespread solar PV loss events
like those previously observed in the California area.
Similarly, four additional solar PV loss events occurred
between June and August 2021 in California.
Mr. GUTHRIE. This bill does not do what Democrats say it will do.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
Scalise), the Republican whip.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Kentucky (Mr.
Guthrie) for yielding.
I rise in strong opposition to this bill that will absolutely
increase the deficit. It will absolutely increase inflation, and this
bill will absolutely increase energy costs. In fact, they have a
multibillion-dollar new tax on energy.
I haven't heard one person in America saying they want to pay more
money for gasoline, yet they are putting billions in new taxes on
energy, so you will not only be paying more for gasoline, but you will
be paying more for utility bills for your household, which are already
skyrocketing because of President Biden and Speaker Pelosi's radical,
far-left spending they have already done the last year and a half.
But it doesn't end there.
$250 billion in cuts to Medicare drugs--that is right. For seniors,
this bill cuts $250 billion out of Medicare drug spending to help
people in higher income brackets be eligible for more ObamaCare
subsidies, so a massive wealth transfer away from seniors to higher-
income people to get subsidies for ObamaCare.
Then let's talk about these 87,000 IRS agents. You think of just
about any NFL stadium in America filled completely with new IRS agents.
That is right, more than doubling the size of the IRS to go after
lower-income people. They love saying on the other side: Don't worry.
It is not going to touch them.
There is only one problem: It doesn't stand up to the facts.
There was an amendment in the Senate, right here, very simple, a one-
page amendment to protect people making under $400,000 from new audits
by the IRS. This amendment was voted down on a party-line vote because
they want that army of 87,000 IRS agents going after lower-income
people.
In fact, the smoking gun came out this morning. They don't have a
full CBO report on this bill. You heard the old adage that you have to
pass the bill to find out what is in it. That is what they are doing
today. That is why they are rushing this bill through today. It doesn't
even have a review from the Congressional Budget Office.
But just a few hours ago, we got this. It was a confirmation that the
IRS agents will be getting about $20 billion in new taxes from people
making less than $400,000. That is right. The CBO just confirmed it a
few hours ago.
President Biden made that promise multiple times: If you make under
$400,000, don't worry; your taxes don't go up. This bill breaks
President Biden's promise. It is confirmed by the CBO.
There was an amendment to stop it from happening, and every Democrat
voted against it. They wouldn't allow us to bring that amendment here
on the floor because they are ramming it through because they don't
want people to know what is inside of this bill.
$700-plus billion in new taxes--budget gimmicks that say, for the new
taxes over 10 years, they are only going to account for 3 years of
spending, which means if you account for the full 10 years, it
increases the deficit. Of course, during inflation times and this
crisis we are facing economically, this bill will increase inflation
and gas prices.
Let's reject the bill and go back to the drawing board.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. Clarke), a member of the Energy and Commerce
Committee.
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for
yielding. I rise today in support of H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction
Act of 2022.
This monumental generational investment in our Nation's future will
lower prescription drug prices and energy costs, extend healthcare
coverage for millions of Americans, and deliver a vital down payment of
resources in our stand against the climate crisis, all while creating
millions of well-paying jobs across America.
Moreover, it makes good on our promise to always fight for this
country's most vulnerable communities, now and forever.
The journey to today has been challenging, to say the least, but I am
at long last elated to know that the change Americans need and demand
is finally here.
Thanks to the hard work and ceaseless resolve of President Joe Biden,
my Democratic colleagues on the Senate side, and every individual who
took seriously their duty to fight tooth and nail to better the lives
of every American in our care, our pursuit of progress has never been
stronger.
For communities of color, our seniors, pregnant and postpartum
people, individuals and families living on low wages, and everyone else
who has long borne the brunt of too many hardships to list, this
legislation represents the initial steps they have long and desperately
awaited.
{time}  1500
The Inflation Reduction Act will prevent thousands of premature
deaths by improving air quality in densely populated communities with
high environmental justice needs.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. Latta), a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
[[Page H7686]]
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5367, a bill
the Democrats claim will reduce inflation when, in reality, it will do
the exact opposite.
American families are struggling to keep the lights on at home. Far
too many people in this country are worrying about the costs associated
with putting food on their table and gas in their tanks. And yet, the
majority has decided now is the time to double down on their tax-and-
spend policies with American taxpayers footing the bill.
It is also concerning that this bill promotes anti-American energy
policies. It will put aside $250 billion at the Department of Energy to
subsidize the rush to green energy. This is picking winners and losers
in the energy market and will scare away investments in baseload power
sources.
American small businesses need access to more reliable energy, not
less. If the grid becomes too reliant on intermittent green energy
sources, we will begin to see manufacturers shutter their operations.
Although it is hard to see how this bill could be salvaged, I did
offer an amendment to try to prevent this outcome. My amendment would
have required the Secretary of Energy to certify that the bill would
not negatively impact electric grid reliability before funding could be
used.
Considering the devastating consequences that would result for
American families and businesses, it makes perfect sense that the
government should do its due diligence in examining all possible
outcomes.
Unfortunately, the majority chose not to consider my amendment on the
House floor today.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this
legislation because it will increase taxes on American families,
institute price controls that will block innovation and medical cures,
promote irresponsible spending on Green New Deal carve-outs and provide
significant risks to the electric grid.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman
from Oregon (Mr. Schrader), a member of the Committee on Energy and
Commerce.
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in complete support of H.R.
5376, the Inflation Reduction Act.
During my time in Congress, I have dedicated my service to improving
our healthcare system and working to lower the cost of prescription
drugs. I am ecstatic that the bill before us today includes my and
Representative Peters drug price reduction framework that will finally
rein in the cost of prescription drugs for our seniors and protect
pharmaceutical innovation, contrary to what the other side will tell
you.
The Medicare drug cost reductions will be transformative. The bill
will allow Medicare to finally negotiate drug prices and the practice
of raising prices in the Medicare program beyond the rising inflation
and provide lasting financial relief to our most vulnerable seniors by
establishing a $2,000 out-of-pocket maximum for spending on
prescription drugs.
The prescription drug cost portions of this bill will also preserve
scientific creativity and the innovation ecosystem that has been
essential to the domestic job-preserving development of life changing
and lifesaving treatments and cures.
And the close to $300 billion in deficit reduction from this portion
of the bill will be huge for the overall viability of our troubled
Medicare system going forward. This will be the biggest improvement to
Medicare since the inception of part D almost 20 years ago. I am proud
to have been a leading advocate to deliver relief on the high cost of
prescription drugs.
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues in both Chambers who worked with
me directly to get this across the finish line.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my good friend.
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from the great
State of Kentucky as well.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the inflation,
recession, IRS army act.
As the American people struggle to put food on their tables and gas
in their cars, Democrats bring us here today to raise Americans' taxes
and destabilize our prescription drug market.
My colleagues across the aisle want everyone to believe that this
bill will drive down the cost of drugs, but they fail to mention that
this policy will severely stifle innovation, unfortunately.
As a proud advocate for individuals suffering with cancer, rare
diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, Alzheimer's, and
Parkinson's, I am committed to seeing cures come to market. But
policies like this one will heartlessly jeopardize the likelihood of
these breakthroughs.
I would like to see my Democratic colleagues work with us on the
productive policy solutions found in the Lower Costs, More Cures Act,
which would drive down the cost of drugs for the American people but
would not destroy the innovative research and development that is
uniquely American.
Sadly, it seems more thought was put into targeting average Americans
with an IRS army and over 1 million new audits than in helping them
find cures for their life-threatening ailments, unfortunately.
Floridians deserve better. And the American people deserve better
than this bogus piece of legislation that will raise taxes and reduce
the number of cures and treatments coming to market.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman
from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), a member from the Committee on Energy and
Commerce.
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the
Inflation Reduction Act. This landmark package is finally on the House
floor after over a year of hard work and rolling up our sleeves.
This bill will serve all Americans by bringing down energy and health
costs, reversing inflation, reducing the deficit, cleaning up our
environment, and sparking a new, clean energy economy. It is
responsibly paid for, and middle-class families will not see any
increased taxes.
This is a defining moment for tackling the climate crisis. This bold
legislation represents the single largest investment in clean energy,
environmental justice, and climate actions in American history,
including the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and increased investments
in both the ATVM loan program, and the Domestic Manufacturing
Conversion Grant program, based on legislation I helped write.
The automotive industry is fully committed to going electric. While
this legislation may pose some challenges in the short term, it will
strengthen the long-term trajectory of the automotive industry, our
domestic supply chains, and American manufacturing.
It is bringing jobs home, strengthening our supply chain, and
reducing our dependency on foreign manufacturing.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. Johnson), my good friend,
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight my
amendment that the minority refuses to even bring to a vote. My
amendment is simple. It would amend this so-called Inflation Reduction
Act by striking from the bill the Methane Emissions Reduction Program,
which is a fancy term for what could be more accurately described as
attacks on American natural gas.
In my district in eastern and southeastern Ohio, oil and gas workers
get up every day to produce our valuable natural resources that are
used to generate electricity, power manufacturing, heat and cool our
homes, cook our food, and more recently, to use our American natural
gas to rescue our European allies who now find themselves under
Vladimir Putin's tyrannical thumb.
This methane tax jeopardizes all of this, and it represents yet
another attack by the majority on American fossil fuels that have
brought more people out of poverty around the world than any other
energy source around the planet.
When I talk to producers in my district, I give them a lot of credit.
These companies, without being asked, are quite literally innovating
every day. They use state-of-the-art technology to capture as much of
their methane
[[Page H7687]]
emissions as possible, and they are proud to do it.
And what is their reward? Well, they get a new tax anyway. It is also
worth noting that the EPA is already working on rulemaking for
regulating methane emissions, and the authors of this bill knew that--
all to appease the radical environmentalist left.
Madam Speaker, I want to be clear that this isn't, ``a methane
reduction program.'' It is a massive tax on American producers,
American businesses, and American workers. It is a tax on job creators
in Ohio. It is a tax on hardworking Americans trying to heat and cool
our homes, and a tax on feeding our families, and a tax on the American
way of life.
We should strike this provision from the bill.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman
from Minnesota (Ms. Craig), a member of the Committee on Energy and
Commerce.
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, today is the day that we deliver on many of
our promises to the American people. We are going to lower the cost of
healthcare for millions of Americans. We are going to invest in
American energy independence and reduce carbon emissions. We are going
to do this in a responsible way, as we reduce the deficit in the
process.
The Inflation Reduction Act takes historic strides to make healthcare
more affordable by capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month for those
on Medicare. Capping out-of-pocket drug costs for our Nation's seniors
at $2,000 a year, and empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices for
our seniors.
We also extend the ACA tax credit, ensuring that we continue along
the path of these historic rates of uninsured in our Nation. We are
going to make the largest investment in clean energy in our Nation's
history, reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent this decade, and invest
in biofuels infrastructure for Minnesota's family farmers.
Madam Speaker, I say to my colleagues, today, the will of our
constituents will prevail over special interests--at least on this side
of the aisle.
Madam Speaker, this legislation will make a real difference in
reducing costs for working families. I am proud to support it, and I
encourage my colleagues to do the same.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman
from Washington State (Ms. Schrier).
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I am so excited to vote today for this
climate and healthcare bill, and here is why: This bill is the answer
to the questions that my constituents have been asking since day one.
Here is what I am hearing:
Dr. Schrier, you have diabetes, too. I can't afford my insulin. I am
having to ration at the end of the month. Won't you do something about
it?
Well, here is the answer: $35-a-month insulin.
Dr. Schrier, I am a senior. I have a fixed income. I can't afford
these high drug prices. Why can't Medicare negotiate them?
Well, here is your answer: Medicare getting the power to negotiate
the cost of prescription drugs.
Also: Dr. Schrier, I am a senior. There are too many out-of-pocket
costs for me.
This caps them at $2,000.
And finally, right now, we have fires burning in Washington State.
And I have farmers who have seen reduced crop yields because of extreme
heat.
They say: Dr. Schrier, can't you do something about climate?
And here is the answer: The biggest investment in climate solutions
that we have ever had.
This bill brings relief. It brings financial relief to families who
are feeling the high inflation in gas prices.
And you know how it does it? By finally making sure that the
wealthiest corporations pay their fair share of taxes, and it does it
without raising tax on middle-class families.
Madam Speaker, I am so excited about this bill because it answers the
requests of the people I represent, and that is why I am so excited to
vote for it today.
{time}  1515
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. Pfluger).
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak against this so-called
Inflation Reduction Act, a piece of legislation that weakens America,
weakens our businesses, increases the cost of energy for all Americans
and our families, and funds a new 87,000-person army of IRS agents that
are coming after low- and middle-income families.
Here is a pretty good rule of thumb for this legislation. If you are
one of Biden's chosen Green New Deal companies, you are probably going
to get a handout from American taxpayers. But for small, independent
American energy producers in districts like mine, the Permian Basin,
your reward for keeping the lights on is a new, poorly conceived
natural gas tax that will raise the cost of everything and give China
an edge on our American manufacturers.
In fact, I offered an amendment to strike this provision, but
Democrats voted it down in the Rules Committee, voting against U.S.
energy and voting for foreign energy.
The Democrat response is tax credits for the rich, a slush fund for
loans to their favorite green companies, and more regulatory red tape
to drive up energy costs for all of us.
Families have to decide whether to fill up their tanks or to pay for
everyday essentials at grocery stores because of high gas prices due to
President Biden's policies.
The crowning achievement of this legislation won't be inflation
reduction. It will be making America more dependent on our adversaries,
more dependent on our adversaries for energy, dependent on China for
medical manufacturing and supply chain issues, and dependent on China
for critical minerals.
If the Democrats' goal is to reduce baseload, reliable power sources
and increase our dependency on foreign nations, they are succeeding. If
their goal is to create regulatory red tape to drive up energy costs
for Main Street businesses and families, once again, they are
succeeding. If their goal is to help American families and small
businesses, this piece of legislation is a fail.
America asked for relief, and instead, Democrats will deliver new and
higher taxes that will be enforced by an 87,000-person IRS army.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for America and against
this bill.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Mrs. Fletcher), a member of the Energy and Commerce
Committee.
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, today is a historic day. Today, we will
vote on the question of whether to allow Medicare to negotiate the
price of prescription drugs and cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors;
lower the cost of healthcare; implement smart energy policy to reduce
emissions, fight climate change, and spur energy innovation; invest in
American manufacturing; and reduce our deficit spending by $300
billion.
We answer these questions ``yes'' by voting for the Inflation
Reduction Act.
As the representative of the energy capital of the world, where we
lead in energy technology and investment, I want to respond to some of
the things that we have just heard.
I am particularly proud of the work that we have done here to ensure
that the historic methane emissions reduction program will actually
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make it possible for energy companies
of all sizes to reduce their emissions through a grant program, and
ensure that the United States remains the global leader in energy
production and in energy innovation and technology.
We do this by voting together for this historic bill today.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. Garamendi).
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, the historic Inflation Reduction Act
lowers everyday costs Americans are struggling to afford by cutting the
price of prescription drugs, by making the largest-ever investment in
climate action, and by reducing inflation--all of this without raising
taxes on middle-class Americans and also paying down the national debt.
For too long, the price of lifesaving prescription drugs has
bankrupted
[[Page H7688]]
American families. No more. This bill caps out-of-pocket drug costs at
$2,000 and allows Medicare finally to directly negotiate the price of
drugs.
Similarly, we must address the increasing costs Americans are bearing
at the hands of climate change. This bill's $369 billion investment in
climate action will unleash a renaissance in clean energy technology,
creating millions of new, high-paying manufacturing jobs, and build the
next generation of American energy and transportation.
Madam Speaker, I support this legislation, and I call upon my
colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to pass this legislation.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Bloomberg News
story reporting how power costs are already forcing U.S. factories to
shut down, featuring an aluminum mill in my district, in Hawesville,
Kentucky.
This underscores the risk to our Nation's competitiveness that these
policies bring about, and this bill will not do what those on the floor
say that it will do.
[From Bloomberg News, July 7, 2022]
The US Industrial Complex Is Starting To Buckle From High Power Costs
(By Joe Deaux and Naureen S Malik)
It was only a matter of time, really.
Europe's fertilizer plants, steel mills, and chemical
manufacturers were the first to succumb. Massive paper mills,
soybean processors, and electronics factories in Asia went
dark.
Now soaring natural gas and electricity prices are starting
to hit the US industrial complex.
On June 22, 600 workers at the second-largest aluminum mill
in America, accounting for 20 percent of US supply, learned
they were losing their jobs because the plant can't afford an
electricity tab that's tripled in a matter of months. Century
Aluminum Co. says it'll idle the Hawesville, Kentucky, mill
for as long as a year, taking out the biggest of its three US
sites. A shutdown like this can take a month as workers
carefully swirl the molten metal into storage so it doesn't
solidify in pipes and vessels and turn the entire facility
into a useless brick. Restarting takes another six to nine
months. For this reason, owners don't halt operations unless
they've exhausted all other options.
It's the most poignant signal yet of what's to come-but not
the only one.
At least two steel mills have begun suspending some
operations to cut energy costs, according to one industry
executive, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn't public. In May, a group of factories across
the US Midwest warned federal energy regulators that some
were on the verge of closing for the summer or longer because
of what they described as ``unjust and unreasonable''
electricity costs. They asked to be wholly absolved of some
power fees-a request that, if granted, would be
unprecedented.
It's no wonder. By the beginning of June, natural gas
prices had tripled what they were a year earlier, threatening
households and businesses alike with some of the biggest
utility bills they've ever seen. This summer, electricity
rates for industrial customers are set to hit their highest
levels ever, based on US government forecasts. Because US
plants and factories depend on both electricity and gas, this
could very well be the moment the rug's pulled out from under
American industry.
Manufacturing overtime hours have already declined for
three straight months, the longest downward stretch since
2015, and a measure of US manufacturing activity weakened in
June to a two-year low as new orders contracted. A week after
Century's announcement, the nation's largest aluminum
producer Alcoa Corp. said it's closing a third of its
production at a mill in Indiana because of ``operational
challenges.''
These headwinds could eventually threaten what some see as
a longer-term boom in US manufacturing as corporations look
to reduce their dependence on China. Executives are
highlighting plans to relocate production at a greater clip
this year than they even did in the first six months of the
pandemic, but energy and labor costs will pose challenges for
any company looking to build a new operation in the US.
Manufacturing isn't the bellwether of the US economy it
once was. The plants that 70 years ago employed more than a
third of the nation's labor force now account for about 8
percent of nonfarm workers. An industrial downturn on its own
won't tip us into a recession, but it could if combined with
weakness in other sectors. While the might of American
industry has significantly weakened over the years, it still
accounts for more than a tenth of US gross domestic product-
and for that reason holds an outsize place in the hearts of
politicians whose factory visits are a perennial staple of
campaigns.
Plants will try to operate more efficiently to lower their
utility bills, but there are limits to how much they can
save. In a lot of regions, industrial users aren't just
paying for the power they use; they're also paying for what's
known as capacity, essentially an insurance policy that keeps
enough power on the grid for the most extreme of demand days.
(Think hot summer days when everyone's air conditioners are
blasting.) And with wholesale energy prices near the highest
levels since 2008 and aging power plants shutting, those
insurance premiums are growing exponentially, particularly in
the middle of the country where much of the country's
industrial operations lie.
One potential bright spot, or an indication of how
desperate industrial companies are becoming: Some are
partnering with startups to explore alternative energy
sources: Nature Energy says it expects to start building
facilities this year to collect and convert cow dung and crop
waste into renewable natural gas. Power Edison, which is
proposing to stack massive batteries on barges that can be
shipped around to customers in need, is attracting more
attention.
As Katie Coleman, an attorney for Texas Association of
Manufacturers, puts it, her members have three big cost
drivers: taxes, electricity, and labor. Those three vary in
proportion over time, she says, ``but right now, electricity
is an even larger factor than normal.'' Some companies with
multiple factories are trying to decide which plants to keep
running this summer based on how cheap they can get their
electricity, she says, and some may decide which to
permanently close. Such is the case for Century, which will
keep operations running in Iceland where power is incredibly
cheap because of local renewable energy resources.
There is a lot to blame for this year's surge in US energy
prices: Russia's invasion of Ukraine; the ensuing surge in US
natural gas exports to markets overseas; extreme weather
brought on by climate change; aging fossil-fuel-fired power
plants retiring at a record pace. They're all coinciding with
a sharp rebound in post-pandemic demand.
One group of manufacturers will say they told us so. The
Industrial Energy Consumers of America has been calling on
the Biden administration for months to limit the amount of
gas US energy suppliers send overseas, warning that exports
would eventually lead to supply shortages at home. But a
measure like that would set a dangerous precedent and
threaten the billions of dollar of investments in liquefied
natural gas terminals along US shores. Shipments overseas
have so far remained unfettered.
How severe of an industrial downturn we're heading into
depends on a lot of variables -chief among them being how
long energy prices remain high. Milder weather, fewer power
plant disruptions, and more solar and wind farm deployments
could shift the natural gas market back into an era of lower
prices and improve the fortunes of manufacturers. Today, we
are far from that.
Michael Harris, whose firm Unified Energy Services LLC buys
fuel for industrial clients, says costs have risen so high
that some are having to put millions of dollars of credit on
the line to secure power and gas contracts. ``That can be
devastating for a corporation,'' he says. ``I don't see any
scenario, absent explosions at US LNG facilities'' that trap
supplies at home, in which gas prices are headed lower in the
long term.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. Carter).
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong
opposition to the inflation expansion act, which includes deeply
troubling proposals that will kneecap medical innovation and harm
patients' access to cures.
Madam Speaker, for 40 years, I was behind the counter. I was the one
who had to tell the patient how much their prescription was going to
be. I was the one who witnessed the senior citizens trying to make a
decision between buying their medication or buying their groceries. I
was the one who had to tell the mother how much the antibiotic was
going to be and see her in tears trying to find the money to pay for
that antibiotic. I know all too well about prescription drug prices.
Today, I am behind the podium as my Democratic colleagues decide
whether to mortgage those same patients' health and well-being for a
political win. This is immoral, and it must be stopped.
The United States leads the world in medical innovation. I have
watched it, and I have seen it as terminal illnesses became treatable
with a simple pill. I have seen the relief on a patient's face when
they heard that a new treatment is available for their once incurable
disease. This bill eradicates hope.
Madam Speaker, we need to help lower drug prices and costs for
patients, but this legislation goes about it in all the wrong ways.
Pharmaceutical companies are the drivers of innovation that deliver
lifesaving cures to patients. However, this legislation will result in
dozens, possibly hundreds, of fewer cures over the next decade.
I tried to fix this self-imposed problem in the Rules Committee on
Wednesday, but it was rejected. I also introduced an amendment to block
the
[[Page H7689]]
Federal Government from funding radical green lobbying groups, but that
was rejected.
There is no excuse for the Federal Government to steal billions of
dollars from taxpayers, including $1.5 billion in funding for tree
equity, while inflation sits at a 40-year high.
Medical professionals are sworn to do no harm. It is time Congress
took the same oath and quit our assault on taxpayers and mostly on
patients.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. Mfume).
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, this is really about people over politics
today, and I am glad that people all over the country are watching and
listening to this debate.
It is not about the wealthy, the well-connected, and the well-off. It
is about people who believe, like many of us, that we have gone too far
without lowering the cost of medicine for everyday people by reducing
and capping costs where they are--the $35 cap on insulin--and finding a
way to close the real gap that exists in terms of affordable care and
extension of the subsidies and making sure that we are really tackling
the climate crisis by providing the things that will allow consumers
and homeowners to do what they need to find a way to take advantage of
the tax subsidies.
Most of all, it says to everyone else that this is completely paid
for. This is not a tax bill. It is paid for. It is paid for by making
sure that the wealthiest and corporations that really get out of paying
taxes don't get out of paying taxes anymore.
It is not about the wealthy, the well-connected, and the well-off. It
is about people all over this country, in Baltimore and elsewhere, who
want and need this legislation.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Indiana (Mr. Mrvan).
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Inflation
Reduction Act, the historic measure that takes action to lower costs
for individuals and families in northwest Indiana and throughout our
Nation.
Of particular importance to me are the provisions that finally
address the unfair disadvantage our seniors face when deciding between
missing a meal or missing a prescription drug.
As a local elected official, I sat at the table with individuals
making those choices, and we were able to find solutions. I appreciate
more than anything that, under this legislation, Medicare will
negotiate certain prescription drug prices, limit out-of-pocket costs
for insulin at $35 per month, and, for the first time ever, cap
Medicare part D out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000. It is to the
seniors' advantage to have this passed.
This is real progress that provides real relief to seniors, and I
urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical legislation.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. Balderson).
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5376.
Today, we are voting on a bill that achieves the exact opposite of what
its name implies.
Here is what is in their $745 billion inflation reduction plan.
It raises taxes on businesses in the midst of a recession. It forces
us into a socialist drug-pricing scheme, leading to fewer lifesaving
cures, higher costs, and less hope. It hires 87,000 more IRS agents to
spy on you. It makes it more expensive to heat your home with a new tax
on American natural gas. It wastes $27 billion on the EPA climate bank
charged with handing out all of your tax dollars to woke energy
corporations.
They are throwing your hard-earned money at their Green New Deal
dreams while carrying out their misguided threats to eliminate fossil
fuels. Just look at Europe's energy crisis to see the true cost of the
rush-to-green agenda.
Rather than unleashing America's abundant energy resources, this
legislation raises taxes on energy production and imposes restrictions
on local producers in my district and in Ohio. Instead of helping bring
down prices at the pump for hardworking Americans, this bill gives away
$7,500 tax credits for the wealthy to buy and upgrade their electric
vehicles.
What does all of this mean for Ohioans? Higher prices, energy
insecurity, and tax hikes.
Madam Speaker, this bill only makes matters worse. I urge a ``no''
vote on H.R. 5376.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. Kim).
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, in 2018, I was at a home in a
retirement community along the Jersey Shore. A gentleman pulled me
aside and, in a whispered voice, shared with me that he pays over $500
a month for prescription drugs and couldn't keep up. He resorted to
halving his pills.
He told me he was a proud man, but I could hear a quiver in his voice
because he felt bad that he couldn't provide for himself and his wife.
He said he worked hard for his entire life, but he can't do this on his
own.
I told him that it was not his fault, that prices had been
skyrocketing, that Medicare had not been able to negotiate prices, and
that here in the richest, most powerful Nation in the world, those who
worked hard over the course of their lives are left to fend for
themselves, halving their medication. How sad is that?
I come to the floor of the House today to say that this stops here.
Medicare will be able to negotiate, and because of that gentleman and
many others I heard from, I decided to help author the provision to cap
the out-of-pocket costs for seniors at $2,000 a year, which is about
$166 a month. Seniors have been waiting too long, and it is time now to
get this done.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining
on both sides.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Houlahan). The gentleman from New Jersey
has 5 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Kentucky has 4 minutes
remaining.
{time}  1530
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. Ryan).
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, this is an American bill--apple pie; mom;
baseball; and red, white, and blue. This is for the exhausted majority
of the people in this country: Democrats, Republicans, and Independents
versus the extremists.
Madam Speaker, if you think that this town has been spending too much
money and we need to reduce the deficit, we do that by hundreds of
billions of dollars. If you think seniors are taking it on the chin, we
help them with prescription drugs and $35 insulin payments. If you
think we need to increase the production of natural gas, that is in
this bill to create jobs here, lower costs here, and export to Europe
and the rest of the world to knock Putin's knees out from under him.
The most exciting thing in this bill is we double down on finally
having an industrial policy in this country to out-compete China. We
are going to build things. On top of the infrastructure bill and the
CHIPS Act, we are going to build electric vehicles, electric cars, and
electric tractors. With batteries, solar, and wind, we are going to
rebuild the middle class.
While the other side wants to defund the FBI, we want to fund our
kids' future here in the United States.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Madam Speaker, there is nothing in the bill that increases our
production of natural gas. The Methane Emissions Reduction Program is a
natural gas tax that will impact the entire economy. The natural gas
tax will make everything more expensive for American families. The
natural gas tax will increase the price of fuel, fertilizer, and food.
Madam Speaker, 180 million Americans use natural gas to heat homes
and run appliances. About 5\1/2\ million businesses use it to run their
workplaces and manufacturing facilities.
This bill will give EPA sweeping authority to expand the natural gas
tax to other sectors, including agriculture. There are no guardrails to
prevent the EPA from ratcheting up the natural gas tax in years ahead.
[[Page H7690]]
Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from the
State of Tennessee (Mrs. Harshbarger).
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the
far-left inflation expansion act.
This bill is detrimental to Americans' wallets and their ability just
to keep their heads above water. This bill is littered with economy-
crushing measures that cater to climate extremists and Socialists. This
tax will impact every single part of our lives. It will be more
expensive to heat our homes, to buy basic necessities, and it will even
de-incentivize manufacturing of thousands upon thousands of goods that
we use every day.
This bill is chock-full of Green New Deal slush funds with no
accountability and no transparency. We cannot afford to pour billions
that we don't have into programs that cut our gas and oil industry off
at the knees--an industry that is already suffering greatly under the
Biden administration.
This attack on our refineries could lead to even higher gas prices. I
know that is hard to believe, but it is true. It leaves us exposed and
more reliant on our enemies.
This bill is problematic from start to finish, but as a licensed
pharmacist for over 30 years, the most concerning part of this
Socialist scheme is that the government will now have authority to set
pricing on lifesaving medication. And when they set the price, it is
going to be out of the reach of the Americans who need it the most. The
tip of the day is you never want the government in control of pricing
anything.
This act will directly take away hope from seniors and as many as
100-plus cures will be in jeopardy. There will be no incentive for
companies to develop cures for rare and ultra-rare diseases. This bill
encourages drug companies to spend less on research and development and
more on navigating the politics of it all.
Americans are already being forced to choose between purchasing
groceries or purchasing their prescriptions, and the last thing anyone
needs is higher prices for prescriptions and rising insurance premiums.
Members on the other side of the aisle continue to push an agenda
that America does not want. This bill is horrendous. It is an
abomination that Democrats would go to such lengths--as far as risking
the health and the safety of the people they swore an oath to
represent--just to push their radical liberal agenda.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to consider the lives that will
be negatively impacted by this radical bill and hope to see all the
Members of the House of Representatives make the right decision for
America with a ``no'' vote on this far-left inflation expansion act.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.
Madam Speaker, I just want to take this opportunity to thank my
committee staff who worked so hard on this legislation for so many
years. This day would not be possible if it wasn't for their dedication
and constant perseverance: Tiffany Guarascio, Waverly Gordon, Rick
Kessler, Una Lee, Jacquelyn Bolen, Saha Khaterzai, Rick Van Buren,
Tuley Wright, Caitlin Haberman, Adam Fischer, Anthony Gutierrez, Tyler
O'Connor, Medha Surampudy, Jacqueline Cohen, Dustin Maghamfar, Timia
Crisp, and Brendan Larkin.
Let me just say, Madam Speaker, I am still waiting for a couple more
speakers. I just want to say that I cannot emphasize enough the
significance of this legislation in terms of reducing costs for seniors
through negotiated prices for Medicare, extending the Affordable Care
Act, which has made so many people have health insurance who didn't
have it before, and also addressing climate change, which is really the
greatest crisis of our time. There is nothing that could be more
significant in this legislation.
Madam Speaker, I would inquire how much time is remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 3 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Kentucky has 1 minute remaining.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. McCarthy), who is one of my good friends here in
Congress, a great leader, and the Republican leader in the House of
Representatives.
Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, today feels like a little deja vu.
It feels like we are sitting back--was it February of last year?
America is on a brink. The world is warning the majority party if
they follow through with more of their spending they could create
inflation in America.
It wasn't just on our side of the aisle that warned you. No. The
former Secretary of the Treasury warned you that if you went through
with that $2 trillion that inflation would rise and America would be
harmed. But nobody listened on the other side.
They were proud. They were going to cheer. They were going to get
elected. They were going to win based upon this. They went ahead and
they passed that bill with one-party control in the House and in the
Senate, and the President signed it.
If you listened to Steve Rattner, a Democratic adviser to Obama, he
called it the original sin of inflation.
Listen to the American public.
Madam Speaker, I hope every single Member asks their constituents:
Could they give 1 month's salary up?
Could they afford to give a month's salary up?
I would love it, Madam Speaker, if the Members would come back and
tell me anyone who says ``yes'' to that.
But the sad part about it, Madam Speaker, is everybody in America who
is paid on a salary just lost more than 1 month because it was deja vu
all over again. It was exactly that vote that took more than 1 month's
salary from every American that is paid monthly.
We have got a President, Madam Speaker, who thinks that inflation is
zero. I guess that is why we are back to where we are again.
Today the people's House should be working to answer our country's
call to address the rising prices of gas, groceries, and just about
anything else that Americans buy. I haven't heard one debate on this
floor today about how we are going to lower the gasoline price. I am
not sure, but I guess, Madam Speaker, on the Democratic side they think
if they raise taxes then somehow that will make the price go down and
not up. They have been proven to be wrong.
Instead, Madam Speaker, moments from now we will take up this
misguided, tone-deaf bill. I believe it is the largest tone-deaf bill I
have ever seen in this Chamber in 232 years.
Democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to
spending other people's money regardless of what we as a country can
afford.
Madam Speaker, I almost see glee in their eyes. I know there are not
a lot of them here because they can vote by proxy. It is the only
Chamber in the history of America that has ever allowed that--not even
on the Senate side, not even during war, and not even during plague,
but this body has, and this body continued it. They just extended it.
This bill wasn't debated here. It wasn't talked about. But a lot of
people are going to phone it in.
They started this Congress with trillions in wasteful spending that
caused runaway inflation.
Their answer was to blame everybody else.
Now, their answer is just to deny there is inflation and just say it
is zero. But today, now they are choosing to end the session by
spending half a trillion dollars more of your money, raising taxes on
the middle class, and giving hand-outs to their liberal allies.
Madam Speaker, unlike most of the Democrats, I have read this bill
past the title. The facts about this bill are just astonishing. It
sends $27 billion to a fraudulent national climate bank. Put that in
perspective: that is triple the size of the EPA's current annual
budget.
Madam Speaker, as I go across the country I look to the gas stations
and see people cry about how much it is costing them.
You chose to raise it higher but not to give relief to the American
public by lowering the gas price.
Along with that slush fund, it hands out tax credits like candy with
no accountability. But when it comes to natural gas, which heats our
homes and cooks our food, it raises taxes to fund their Socialist
scams.
Madam Speaker, your energy prices will now go through the roof.
[[Page H7691]]
Madam Speaker, I look forward to hearing how every Democrat who votes
for this bill--be it in person or how they phone it in by proxy--
explain it to their constituents this winter when they are making a
choice about whether they pay the energy to heat their homes or they
cut back on the gas to fill their tank or they no longer even buy the
food at the grocery store because it just comes too high, they have to
change.
Madam Speaker, as they continue to raise trillions after trillions,
when everybody warns them what they do is wrong, they don't care. They
just want to double down on the mistakes they have already made.
Don't expect drug prices to come down either. This bill would cut
treatments and hinder new cures by giving bureaucrats the power to
decide what drugs seniors can access. It reduces your options and
raises your costs.
That is okay because that is their philosophy. They know best. Just
like they knew best when they thought $2 trillion would help. They
called it the American Rescue Plan.
You now have time to see what you have done.
Explain to me in the American Rescue Plan when it raised inflation
and that took 1 month's salary from the American public, what did it
rescue?
{time}  1545
Who did it help?
Answer me this question: Is America better off today than they were 2
years ago? Is the price of gasoline lower? It is?
The price of gasoline is lower today than it was 2 years ago? I guess
you believe inflation is zero, too. I am not quite sure about your
math.
Is grocery lower than it was 2 years ago? Are the car prices lower
than it was 2 years ago? Are your food prices?
I would love a natural debate right here. Why don't we have that?
Because the American people are having a challenge.
You know, one of the most successful businesses in America is
Walmart. When Walmart wants to look at where the economy is in America,
they don't go hire economists. You know what they do? They just check
the data of Americans and what they buy. And for those who answered
yes, you ought to study it, too.
You know what? They just look at four products. They look at
hamburger buns, hotdog buns, whole wheat, and white bread. And you know
what? If the hamburger buns sales go down and the hot dog buns sales go
down and the whole wheat sales go down, but the white bread sales go
up, you are in an economic crisis. You know why? Because people no
longer can make the decision to have hamburgers with hamburger buns.
They have to put the white bread there.
For all of you who said yes, why don't you get out of Washington for
a moment and go ask your constituents if they are better off today than
they were 2 years ago; because no, gas is not lower. Gas is higher. And
no, the car prices are higher, and their food prices are higher, and
they are going up each and every day.
I can't believe you would say yes. You probably believe the American
Rescue Plan was a good bill. You probably believe it is Putin's fault,
too.
Passing this bill today means more expensive bills for Americans
tomorrow, and everyone who says otherwise isn't telling the truth.
But of all the bad parts of this 700-page bill, the massive expansion
of the IRS is the most chilling.
Madam Speaker, I wonder if we could ask the same question and, oh,
boy, I imagine America will ask that in just roughly 87 more days. They
won't just ask it, they will answer the question, even if it is not
asked; if they are better off than they were 2 years ago.
But they will probably ask the question: Is America better off with
87,000 more IRS agents?
Currently, the IRS has almost 80,000 employees. So you are going to
smile; you are going to vote for it. A lot of you are going to mail it
in because you are just going to vote by proxy. You are going to pass a
bill you never debated by people voting by proxy.
You are going to double the size of the IRS. They have 80,000
employees. You know what the IRS also has? 4,600 guns, 5 million rounds
of ammunition. Why?
Democrats want to double its already massive size. You are going to
spend $80 billion of hard-earned American taxpayer money to hire an
army of 87,000 new IRS agents.
Why would you even propose that? Because you say, oh, it pays for the
bill.
Madam Speaker, I have got plenty of time.
I think I will. I appreciate the encouragement because I think
America needs the encouragement, because you know what? America
actually needs a plan that works.
Why, if you passed an American Rescue Plan that caused inflation that
we haven't seen in 41 years--why, if you went after the fossil fuel of
America that raised the price of gasoline that Americans haven't seen
before--why do you keep harming the American public? And you think
doing the exact same thing is your answer to save it?
But while this bill doubles the number of IRS personnel, it does not
expand due process protections for the American people. Worse, it
includes no income floor for who can be audited.
Some of the same people on the other side of the aisle, Madam
Speaker, who say we are better off than we were 2 years ago, that
somehow--I don't know where they get their gas, but they said their gas
price is lower. Let me know, because I need to fill my tank up.
So when you say that you are not going to go after every American to
audit, you are not being honest, just like you are not being honest
about what you did to cause the pain to this country. And you have no
plan to solve it. You simply double down to the exact same thing you
did before.
Based upon the past numbers, we know this would mean 710,000 new
audits for people who make under $75,000. So someone who makes under
$75,000, you think they need to pay for this. So what you are going to
do is not trust them.
Madam Speaker, you say you don't trust the American public, but you
are not going to hire all these people for the IRS so they could be
there to help people fill out their tax returns. No, these people are
going to audit them. We are going to double the size, and they are
going to go after you.
You see, there is a philosophy here, Madam Speaker. One side of this
aisle believes in the American people. One side thinks they know best.
Even when the gas prices have risen, you think it is lower.
I am sorry to tell you, Madam Speaker, the President even admitted
the gas price is higher, but he thought it was a good thing. It was a
good thing. Because you think everybody can go out and buy a new car.
Well, we are going to audit you because we need to go after you
because we think you are not fair, you are not honest, and we are going
to make you pay for something else. Just pay for the things we care
most about.
It costs individuals thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees and
compliance costs just to be audited by the IRS.
Imagine what you would do with an extra $10,000 a year. Imagine how
much better you could have used it than the Federal Government.
And somehow you think it is best. You think it is best.
That is how Democrats pay for their pet projects. Your pocketbook is
their plan to fund more inflationary spending.
This is just a train wreck just waiting to happen. And with this new
power, the IRS will snoop around in your bank account, in your Venmo,
your small business, and then the government will shake you down for
every last cent.
You know, in light of this week's events, let me ask: Do you really
trust this administration, the IRS, to be fair, to not abuse their
power?
I hope that I am wrong, but history doesn't lie.
Madam Speaker, as I travel the country, a lot of people know
different names of people who work at the IRS, Lois Lerner, and others.
And even when it comes to light, government is powerful, government is
big, government can take, as you have proven. You have taken so much
from the American public. But now you want to intimidate them.
I have watched Democrats weaponize the government before, and I don't
trust them now.
Madam Speaker, mark my words. Long after the headlines of this week
[[Page H7692]]
fade, we will look back on this very day and on this bill as the one
that broke the camel's back.
I am sure, Madam Speaker, as the months progress, there will be new
blame, there will be new problems. It will be those who own the gas
station. You will probably blame the small families that had to buy the
natural gas for their price going higher.
Somehow you will blame Putin again, and somehow you will tell the
American public, no, your price isn't higher; you are actually better
off, there is zero inflation, even though you take home less and
everything costs more.
Let me tell you about the future the Democrats want for America, the
future that we can expect if this bill passes, much like the one
before.
When wealthy Americans are getting tax breaks to buy luxury cars but
you can't afford to even fill up your tank, blame this bill, blame the
Democrats.
When store shelves are empty because more American manufacturers have
gone under, blame this bill, blame the Democrats.
When government agents are knocking at your door and threatening your
business, blame this bill, blame the Democrats.
And when your loved ones are left without the cures they need to
fight a rare disease, blame this bill, and blame the Democrats.
My friends, that is the exact choice for us today. Now, I know a few
Democrats showed up. And, hopefully, all those who are voting by proxy
are watching on TV, because they must be home sick, because that is
what they said. I hope they spent the time to read it.
I don't know if they read the American Rescue Plan, but they know the
damage they have done. America feels it each and every day.
Madam Speaker, I guess the next question would be--it will be
interesting to hear the answer from the other side. If you think gas is
cheaper than it was 2 years ago, if you think the prices at the grocery
store are lower than it was 2 years ago, do you think the border is
more secure than it was 2 years ago?
Someone said yes.
Madam Speaker, I am going to introduce a bill to rename this place
fantasyland. I hope when you go home, I hope you take the smirks off,
and I hope you actually read your obituaries because fentanyl has now
become the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and
45. It is not something to smirk about.
I am sure you got power; you are in the majority. But you abuse the
power, Madam Speaker. When you abuse power like that, people die. Every
walk of life, we are seeing it day in and day out.
I remember the headline of six college kids down in Florida this
summer. They weren't in a fraternity. They weren't in a sorority. They
were in the military academy. Six of them OD'd. Four of them took the
drug; two did not. Two simply gave them mouth to mouth.
You think it is important to double the size of the IRS, but you are
not going to do one thing for the border?
I remember right after you took the power, you took over the House,
the Senate, and the White House, and you decided to change the
policies. We watched what has come across the border. I took a trip
down there.
I remember going, talking to the agents. They were telling me they
have never seen anything like this before. I said: What do you mean?
They said: We are catching people on the terrorist watch list. I
said: What? On the terrorist watch list? Really? I didn't know there
was that many people on the terrorist watch list just from the triangle
of Central America.
No, no, no, no, no. We are catching them from Yemen. People come from
160 different countries across this border now. They bring their
fentanyl from China.
I went and did a press conference, and I talked about that.
Madam Speaker, I thought people from both sides of the aisle would be
very concerned about hearing people on the terrorist watch list are
coming into America, knowing what has happened in this country before,
and we would want to keep it safe.
I was shocked. They didn't ask me for more information. They just
simply called me a liar.
{time}  1600
We provided the proof. Nobody apologized. That is okay. You don't
need to apologize, but I wish you would do something about it. They
continued to stay silent. Then they fought to even get more
information.
But I fear to tell you that that is happening each and every day.
There is not one new piece of money in here to secure that any more.
That will stop as colleges open back up and as college students on the
weekend go to their Snapchat, think they are buying a Xanax, and they
don't wake up the next morning. But that is okay because you just gave
a break to one of your big donors who makes a lot of money and is going
to buy an electric car. It is okay because you feel good about what you
are going to do. I guess that is why you don't show up to vote; you
just vote by proxy.
A vote for this bill is a vote to help the well-connected get further
and further ahead while leaving needs of hard-working American families
behind. Yet, you could be forgiven for not understanding the gravity of
today's vote. For such a supposedly historic occasion, few Democrats
even bothered to show up.
Look around this Chamber, Madam Speaker. The floor is nearly empty.
If Democrats really, truthfully want to raise taxes on Americans
during a recession, that is their choice. That is the power they have.
They have proven it time and again, and they will do it.
The very least you can do, Madam Speaker, is show up in person if you
are going to vote ``yes.'' Show up in person to the American public.
For those who chant: ``Yes, gasoline is lower than it was 2 years ago;
yes, the border is safer than it was 2 years ago,'' don't say it when
the cameras are off. Don't say it when people can't see who is saying
it. Go to the mikes. If you believe it, go to the mikes and say it.
Better yet, tell your district about it because they know
differently. America knows differently.
But if you want to vote ``yes,'' you should have the courage and the
decency to show up and do that in person. Yet, Madam Speaker, Speaker
Pelosi extended proxy voting again on Wednesday, allowing Democrats to
hide their faces and vote to take your money from the comfort of their
summer vacations.
``Absolute power corrupts absolutely,'' Madam Speaker. That is a
famous quote.
There are lots of lessons people learn. Normally, the lesson you
learn the most is when you cause the most pain. I guess creating
inflation you haven't had in 41 years, creating shortages where there
is no baby formula, gas prices that we haven't seen since Jimmy Carter
was in office, a border that is wide open, a government, Madam Speaker,
that had an Attorney General call parents terrorists because--what did
they do?
They went to a school board meeting.
Why would they go?
Why would parents go to a school board meeting?
Because they wanted to know what was happening in their kids'
education, the lost learning of the years of the pandemic.
If you question authority, you are going to be called a terrorist.
How far would we go to be able to have the rights to do that?
We are going to find an organization, a union, that will send us a
letter so we can do it. But when the public finds out why, the union
pulls their letter back. But the AG doesn't pull back their power
because they have power, they should use it.
Is that why you want to double the size of the IRS?
Is that why you want to double the size of the IRS, to go after
Americans, to use it?
Earlier today, we had 80 Democrats use a proxy vote. As we approach
this final vote on this bill, depending on how long I speak, I expect
that number might increase.
If you think about it, that is the story of this Democrat majority.
They will destroy our economy and mortgage your future but can't be
personally bothered to show up, to make the trip to D.C. to do their
jobs.
What a disgrace. What a disgrace.
I will promise the American public that that will all change. If you
run for
[[Page H7693]]
office, if you are going to ask them to lend their vote and to lend
their voice to go to Washington for 2 years to represent them, you are
going to show up.
And do you know what? The bills are going to be in committee. The
bills are going to be read. They are going to be debated on the floor,
and you are not going to hide in your vacation home and raise taxes on
the American public.
I will even go further. We will lower your gas prices. We will make
America energy independent. We won't punish natural gas. If you care
about the environment, American natural gas is 41 percent cleaner than
Russian natural gas. We will make an abundance of it.
So those people who are living on a $75,000 income who have watched
it get dwindled under your leadership, under your American Rescue Plan
that simply took a whole month's salary away from them, and where they
had no say, you celebrated it, you cheered it, and then you blamed
everybody else for what you created. We will tell you it will cost
less.
For the parent that wakes up that morning--maybe it is a phone call
or maybe their kid is home, who doesn't wake up because they went out
and purchased something that wasn't fentanyl but it was laced with
fentanyl, we will make sure that stops.
It is August. Right now is normally the time people have barbecues,
but now the price is high. Now people question whether to even get the
hotdog buns.
They are going to turn on the TV, they are going to watch an empty
Chamber, and they are going to read online that 80 Democrats took that
vacation and voted to raise more taxes, voted to spend more of their
money, and looked into the camera and smiled and said:
We know best. We want to take more of your money because we
have got to hire and double the size of the IRS because we
want them to knock on your door because we think you are not
honest and because we think you can pay more.
And if you don't, we have got an AG that will come after
you. If you go to that school board meeting, we will look in
your eyes, we will take your name down, and we will wonder
why you care about your kids' education.
Madam Speaker, that will end, too, because we are going to provide
the American public with a parents' bill of rights. We think that
parents should have a say in their kids' education. We think that
parents should know what is being taught at their children's schools.
Madam Speaker, I even watched, under this leadership, a Democrat who
voted by proxy who wasn't even in America.
So I wondered: Were they in another country to get healthcare? Were
they sick?
No, no, no. They were in France at a wedding when they phoned that
vote in. I wasn't quite sure.
Do you think at the wedding the Member was reading the bill on the
phone so that Member knew how to vote?
I am not sure it came through committee. I don't know how much debate
they had on this because the Senate did this bill. What a disgrace.
Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to reject this out-of-touch
bill, reject the crushing new taxes, reject the ballooning of
government, and reject the spending on things that we don't need with
money we don't have.
Madam Speaker, I can wait, if you need to continue.
But most of all, I urge my colleagues to remember this day. Remember
this day because it will be the last time the House will operate so
recklessly and irresponsibly.
A new day is coming with a new plan to put America back on the right
track. It will be a commitment to America that there will be fiscal
responsibility and there will be energy independence where your
gasoline price will be lower and plentiful, that your home heating
costs will lower and not rise; and that we won't pick one energy over
the other. It will be all of the above so America can be stronger. Your
border will be secure because fentanyl and terrorists will not be
coming across. This border is a national security issue.
We will focus on bringing the supply chain from China back to
America, which is not what this bill does. This bill takes American
taxpayer money and sends it to China. You triple the size of the EPA. I
imagine China is cheering, because they see their economy is going to
rise. Their government doesn't have to vote for a stimulus, because
that is exactly what you are doing here.
What is even greater, China will look and say: Well, can we make sure
America can send all that money here?
Don't worry, the Democrats doubled the size of the IRS. They will get
that money and make sure it comes.
In the commitment to America, we believe people show up to go to work
and that you earn your paycheck. You don't phone it in.
Madam Speaker, when I handed the gavel to Speaker Pelosi last year, I
said that a House distracted could not govern. Today, as this majority
jams through yet another partisan spending spree, it is clear to me
that an absent House cannot lead.
I trust the American people. I know it is the people who will render
the ultimate verdict on today's actions. When they do 87 days from now,
my Democratic colleagues will have only themselves to blame.
Madam Speaker, I am not sure what is happening on your side of the
aisle that Members actually believe gasoline is less than it was 2
years ago.
Madam Speaker, I am not sure what is happening on your side of the
aisle that your colleagues believe the border is more secure than it
was 2 years ago.
Madam Speaker, I am not sure what is happening on your side of the
aisle that your colleagues believe the price of groceries is less than
it was 2 years ago.
Madam Speaker, I am not sure what is happening on the other side of
the aisle that your colleagues believe doubling the size of the IRS is
a positive thing.
{time}  1615
Yes, I come from a different party, and yes, I have a different
philosophy, but we are all Americans. Madam Speaker, you are going
inflict this pain on every single American.
Madam Speaker, I am not sure if your side of the aisle thinks this is
going to do anything to lower the price of inflation. I do know, Madam
Speaker, one person on the other side of the aisle in the other
Chamber, Bernie Sanders, spoke the truth and said it won't.
I know on your side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, not everybody
believes the same. The former Secretary of the Treasury warned you
before you did the American Rescue Plan that it would bring inflation,
and he was right. Even the current Secretary of the Treasury finally
apologized and said they were wrong.
The President said it was going to be transitory. He said it had
peaked. He said it was everybody else's fault, but now he says it is
zero.
Madam Speaker, I guess I do understand why your side of the aisle now
believes all that. I just know America doesn't. Because every day
America goes to the grocery store, the price has increased. Every week
when they fill up their gas tank, the price is higher. Every month when
they cash their check, it doesn't go as far.
Madam Speaker, if the border was really more secure than it was 2
years ago, why is the D.C. mayor now asking for the National Guard when
she wouldn't even ask for it when there were riots in the streets?
Madam Speaker, my colleagues on the other side can lie to me, but
they can't lie to America. Eighty-seven days from now it doesn't matter
how you try to answer those questions. The American people will.
I remember when we were at this stage once before. We had somebody in
the White House that put a sweater on and told us to turn the heater
down, that the best days were behind us as Americans.
I watched another person walk to the podium and say no pastels, fly
the bold colors, and go to that shining city on the hill.
We know what America is. And we are more than a country. We are an
idea, an idea so powerful that we can overcome all the pain that you
have caused.
It won't be easy. And I will offer this invitation. For all the bad
votes you have taken, when the change comes, we will welcome you to
correct the mistakes you have made. Because you will be in committee.
Maybe you will learn that gas prices are higher. Maybe you will learn
that groceries cost more. You will be here to vote so you will
[[Page H7694]]
hear the debate. Maybe I can't blame you for thinking that if you don't
have to show up.
Madam Speaker, there are a lot of days on this floor that change the
course of history. In the last 2 years, that history has not been
bright. Inflation, a 41-year-history high. Do you understand what that
does to the American public? Do you understand the pain that it causes?
Do you understand the choices that people have to make?
I heard the story of a young family, their daughter has cancer. For
her treatment they have to drive a long way. She was crying one day
because she heard her parents talking about making the decision to take
out loans they cannot afford to pay for the gasoline that your side of
the aisle thinks costs them less but costs them more, the choices they
had to make because you titled a bill ``American Rescue Plan'' that
only inflicts pain, and you just doubled down.
Madam Speaker, I would respect the other side of the aisle much
greater if they would at least do exactly what Secretary Yellen did,
apologize for your mistake and change course.
Don't double down. Don't make the same mistake three, four times like
you are going to do today. At the very least--at the very least, if you
are going to vote ``yes,'' do it in person. Do it in person. Read the
bill. Put it through committee.
Madam Speaker, I have watched this body take on big issues. We have
got some of the biggest issues before us today. You continue to make it
just a partisan action, one that even your side of the aisle has warned
you against. But somehow you want to celebrate it.
Madam Speaker, in my office in a conference room, I have this
painting of Washington crossing the Delaware. You all know the famous
painting. It sits 8 feet by 16 feet. If you study history, you will
know that it happened Christmas 1776. The artist who painted that
famous painting wasn't even American. He wasn't there. He had no iPhone
that day to take a photo. The person who painted the painting is a
German immigrant who lived in America but went back to Germany. His
name is Emanuel Leutze.
Do you know why he painted that painting? Because he understood
America was more than a country, that America was an idea. He wanted
Germany to have a revolution based upon the values of America, of
freedom, of individual rights, of a stand against tyranny, that
government would be of the people, by the people, for the people.
His talent was art, so he thought he would paint this painting to
inspire the Germans to have this revolution. Now, historians will tell
you he gets it incorrect. He puts 13 people in a rowboat. Why would he
pick the number 13? Thirteen colonies. But he only shows you 12 faces.
If you look at the painting, he puts Washington in a rowboat, but
historians will tell you Washington probably crossed in a Durham boat.
If you look at the Delaware, it kind of looks like the Rhine. But he is
German. We will give him a break for that. He puts Washington in a
ceremonial uniform with his hand on his chest standing up in a rowboat
crossing the Delaware in the middle of winter. He looks so stoic.
If you look at Washington in that painting, you would almost say you
would follow this man anywhere. You would think he had never lost a
battle or a fight. But for the students of history, they understand at
that moment in time, Washington had never won a battle. We had never
won one fight as a country. But that was our first victory, as we
surprised the Hessians.
But what I would like you to see next time is who is in the boat. The
second person is wearing a beret. He is Scottish. The person directly
across from him in the green jacket, he is African American. You come
down the boat, and in the middle of the boat, the person who almost
looks the strongest, rowing in the red, is a woman. In the very back,
the very last person, is a Native American.
I cannot tell you from a historical point of view if they were in the
boat that night. But to this young immigrant who had lived in America,
that is who he believed would be in the boat.
Now, the second to last person in the boat, he has a hand across his
face. It is the hand of the 13th person nobody sees. What this artist
was saying--Emanuel, I believe--Here we are, not a country but an idea,
having lost every battle before but willing to create a Nation. Why? To
go against the tyranny of a government that will tax you with no say, a
government that became so big it can inflict pain upon you, tell you
what to do, that we would risk it on our holiest of night.
Here is a hand. Would you get in and join us?
That is as true today as it was then. The challenge that we face
right now is you are making that government big. You are doubling the
size of the IRS. You are going against every single reason people were
in that boat willing to risk their lives for a government of the
people, by the people, for the people, a government that was created in
a country that was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the
proposition that we are all equal, because you think you know what is
best.
I can only imagine what those individuals would think today, that you
would put a bill on the floor that didn't go through committee. You put
a bill on the floor that would double the size of the IRS, that could
go after the American public, that has no set on an income, that
710,000 people under the income of $75,000 are now going to be audited
because you want them to pay for what you think is best, that you're
going to tax, with no limit on income, some family that already lost a
month's salary based upon your past actions because of inflation.
You are going to make them choose how cold. You are going back to
Jimmy Carter. You are simply telling the American public to put that
sweater on, turn that heater down. But to your elite donors, you are
going to give them the tax credit from those IRS agents so they can go
buy a new Tesla. That is what you are doing in this bill.
But 4 to 6 months from now, you will blame somebody else for it. The
good news is, there will be a new Congress with a new ability to change
all that, that will provide the American public a commitment to
America, a new plan to put this country back in the right direction.
Madam Speaker, with whatever happens today--and I can only guess, if
you have all the votes in your pocket that people don't have to show
up, one or two people can determine the outcome. But, Madam Speaker, I
implore upon you--I don't know what happens in your conference--please
allow the American public to come in to simply tell you and explain to
you that, no, gas is not lower, groceries do not cost less, and the
money does not go as far as it did before.
Maybe that is why I can only understand, if you truly believe that,
that you would vote ``yes.'' For everybody else that is living in the
real America, they will vote ``no.'' And 87 days from now, I believe
most of America will have the answer to that question, too, with a new
Congress and a new plan.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Jacobs of California). The gentleman
from New Jersey has 3 minutes remaining. The time of the gentleman from
Kentucky has expired.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.
I will speak briefly before I introduce our two leaders who have done
so much on the Democratic side to make this bill a possibility today.
The Republican leader said that we should listen to our constituents.
Well, we have.
Yesterday, I was at a senior center in Woodbridge, and a woman came
up to me and said: You know, Congressman Pallone, I spend $1,500 a
month on prescription drugs. And I was able to say to her: I am going
to be in Washington tomorrow. I am going to vote on a bill that is
going to cap your expenditures at $2,000 a year.
Then I had another woman in a telehealth meeting earlier in the week
who told me that she was so hot, because in New Jersey we have had the
worst drought and the highest temperatures that we know in years, and
she said: I have to go to a cooling center because of the heat, because
of my health and the impact on my health.
{time}  1630
I was able to say to her: Look, it is going to take a while, but
tomorrow--this Friday--I am going to vote on a bill that is going to
address the climate change and the heating and the warming of this
planet.
[[Page H7695]]
Madam Speaker, I want to thank our two leaders for what they have
done to bring this about today.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
Hoyer).
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Today will be the culmination of the meeting of promises that
President Biden made to the American people resulting in some 7 to 8
million more people voting for President Biden than the incumbent
President.
My colleagues, we have just heard from the leader of the party of:
You are on your own.
The leader who just spoke voted against the American Rescue Plan that
put money in the pockets of American families, put American children
back to school, and resulted in our not wearing masks today by--with
some exceptions--putting vaccine in arms.
The leader who just spoke voted ``no,'' as did every one of his
colleagues. They said ``no'' to money to help families not fall through
the cracks, to help them afford their groceries, to help them afford to
pay their mortgage, and to send their kids to school.
They voted ``no'' to make sure those vaccines were in arms.
They voted ``no'' to help small businesses, restaurants, and others
be lifted up. The party of: You are on your own, America.
And yes, when they came to office, what did they try to do in 2017?
Repeal healthcare support for the American people.
We are doing the opposite. We plead guilty.
The leader of the Republican Party who just spoke voted ``no'' on the
infrastructure bill to respond to building roads and bridges and to
making sure they are maintained and safe; to respond to broadband to
make sure that rural areas are connected, and with airports to make
sure we had a grid that made us competitive.
The gentleman who just spoke voted ``no.''
As far as the CHIPS bill, the gentleman talked about China. China was
lobbying against the CHIPS bill. The minority leader voted ``no'' on
the CHIPS bill, which was a bill to make America competitive and create
hundreds of thousands of jobs. That was bipartisan in the House by a
small degree and in the Senate, as well. But the minority leader voted
``no.''
So I must say that I am not shocked that he is voting ``no'' on this
bill, which is aimed at helping Americans with their healthcare, which
is one of the greatest reasons for inflation.
I am not surprised that he mischaracterized the reaction on this side
of the aisle when he said gas prices were high and haven't come down.
In fact, in the last 40 days, they have come down 20 percent.
The gentleman is shaking his head, no, no, they haven't. I don't know
where he is buying gas, but they have come down from $5 to $4, and in
some cases less than $4.
Is that too high?
Yes, it is.
Should we be concerned about that?
Yes, we should be.
We passed two bills. One was a bill to make sure that we didn't have
price gouging. No American wants to see price gouging.
The minority leader voted ``no'' on that bill.
We offered another bill that dealt with food and fuel prices and to
try to make sure that we have delivery systems and supply chains that
worked.
The minority leader and his colleagues voted ``no''--not everyone.
We had a bill on this floor that tried to help and is going to help
millions of veterans who had been exposed to toxic burn pits--cancer,
heart disease, and lung disease. The minority leader, it will not shock
you, voted ``no'' to help veterans.
We had another bill on the floor to make sure that we could preclude
and try to help women who had violent acts committed against them. It
may not surprise you that the leader of the party of: You are on your
own voted ``no'' on the Violence Against Women Act.
It is time to say ``yes,'' yes to the people, to focus on people and
not on the politics of 87 days from now.
That is what this is about: politics pure--well, impure--and simple.
It is time for us to say ``yes'' to bringing prices down.
Now, I want to add just a couple of things, and I want to talk about
the four pieces of legislation that are changing America for the
better.
He wrings his hands about the awful situation that America is in.
In January of 2021, before Joe Biden became President of the United
States, unemployment was 6.4 percent. During the course of the Trump
administration, we had lost 2.8 million jobs; a net loss after 4
years--net loss.
Over the last 18 months, we have created 9.5 million jobs. That is
almost a 12 million-job turnaround, to the best, to the good, to the
appreciation of ability of Americans to get jobs.
And he mentioned something about gas prices.
Are they high?
They are.
Let me tell you when they were higher. In July of 2008 they were
higher.
Hear me. Go check the records. $4.14, which in real dollars today
would be $5.62 under George Bush.
Are prices too high?
They are.
Do we want to bring them down?
Yes, we do. That is why we fought price gouging on food and fuel,
both of which the minority leader voted against.
As I said, unemployment in January was 6.4 percent. It is now 3.5
percent; halved.
Is inflation too high?
It is.
We passed a bill. Some people said, Well, that is going to cause
inflation.
What it caused was people didn't fall through the cracks. They were
able to pay their bills. They were able to send their kids back to
school. That is what it did. That is what the American people are going
to remember, that the Democratic Party was there for them and the
Republican Party was not.
Then we talk about this money that we are going to give to IRS, which
has been reduced 20 percent under the Republican leadership when they
were in charge.
What did they reduce?
Enforcement.
Why?
Because they didn't want their big, fat cat people to be caught not
paying their fair share.
Yes, Mr. and Mrs. America, you are paying a higher price because some
people pay nothing. You don't think that is fair, and we don't think it
is fair. And, yes, we want to make sure the rules are followed.
In order to have the rules followed, you need referees. And when you
have 100-some-odd million taxpayers, you need a number of people to
find that out and make sure that you obey the law.
Yes, we support that. We believe in facts, and we believe in truth.
There is a Republican leader--no longer a leader--who believed in
facts and truth, and Liz Cheney was fired from her position because she
told the truth and confronted a former President who promotes lying.
Madam Speaker, when President Biden took office with a Democratic
Congress, we promised the American people results. We are delivering.
We promised we would make progress on the issues where progress has
been stalled for far too long. We promised, in short, responsible
government that gets things done ``for the people.'' People, not
politics. We promised responsible government that puts the needs of our
people over politics.
Over the past 18 months, many have questioned whether that would even
be possible. Our country is too divided, they said, to achieve big
goals and enact really consequential legislation that benefits the
American people and our economy.
Madam Speaker, 9.5 million new jobs in 18 months.
Over these same 18 months, however, our Democratic majorities and the
Biden-Harris administration have proven those doubters wrong.
The legislation we will pass today and send to the President's desk
is the fourth leg of a table of support and opportunity Democrats have
built for the American people.
The first leg was the American Rescue Plan. That law put more than
200 million shots in arms and made it safe again for workers to go back
to their jobs, for students and teachers to go back to school, and for
entrepreneurs
[[Page H7696]]
to take risks and invest in their businesses. It worked.
Since then, we have seen record job growth. As I have said, 9.5
million jobs have been created since last January. That is the largest
number of jobs created in 18 months in the history of our country and
the lowest rate of employment in half a century. Only Republicans could
call that failure, because it wasn't their success.
More Americans are working today than at any point in our history. We
also cut child poverty in half. Perhaps that is not seen as a success
by the other side of the aisle.
Next, we brought Democrats and Republicans together in a historic
effort to enact the bipartisan infrastructure plan, which is already
rebuilding roads, bridges, transit systems, seaports, and airports in
every corner of our country, after President Trump said in 2016 that he
was going to do a trillion dollars.
In 2017 it didn't happen. In 2018 it didn't happen. In 2019 it didn't
happen.
The Republicans were in charge of the House, Senate, and the
Presidency of the United States.
Inattention and disrepair. For years, we heard people talking about
``infrastructure weeks.''
Do you remember that?
The minority leader and others: We are going to have an
infrastructure week.
It never happened.
Last November, we put people over politics and got it done. That
decision was so successful that even many of the Republicans who voted
against it are cutting ribbons that will facilitate commerce and
improve the lives of their constituents, even though they didn't
support the bill.
One side effect of the pandemic was to magnify the cracks in our
economic system and our reliance on the unreliable in our supply
chains.
Any family trying to buy a new car or trying to budget for a new
appliance in the last year or two understands what that means.
And by the way, on inflation, Europe didn't have the rescue plan.
Asia didn't have the rescue plan. Other nations didn't have the rescue
plan.
Guess what, Madam Speaker?
All of them are experiencing inflation, half of them greater
inflation than is present in the United States of America.
Does that mean we have to stop our efforts to reduce it?
Of course not.
Is it hurting our people?
It is.
Are empty shelves on grocery stores troubling?
They are.
{time}  1645
Rather than blame one another, perhaps we ought to look at the real
villain, and that was the pandemic.
Earlier this week, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act,
the third leg of our table of support and opportunity, into law.
That bipartisan legislation will ease inflation by bringing
manufacturing and sources of critical components and products back to
the United States so that we make them in America, and our workers make
it in America.
It means that we won't cede the next century of innovation to China
or anybody else. China--let me repeat--lobbied against that bill, and
almost every Republican voted against that bill, just like China
wanted.
Instead, American labor and American innovation will continue to lead
the world in research, innovation, and advanced manufacturing and
continue to draw the brightest minds from around the world. That also
will mean lower costs for American families.
The CHIPS and Science Act was another significant piece of
legislation under the Make It In America agenda. It is hard to think
that somebody would vote against all four of these bills--a promise
made to America and a promise that they relied on and they voted for in
an election--not a poll, not a survey, and not a focus group--in an
election.
That is because it gets to the heart of what government is supposed
to do: help provide our workers, businesses, and people with the tools
and confidence to make it in America.
Today, we are going to send to President Biden the legislation that
represents the fourth leg of our table of support and opportunity: the
Inflation Reduction Act. As its name suggests, it will further help
lower costs for Americans.
First, it will lower healthcare costs by extending the cost-saving
premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that we included in
the American Rescue Plan, which has gotten us to 92 percent coverage in
America. And, very frankly, it would be higher if there weren't States
who had refused to provide the Medicaid opportunity for citizens who
fell in the middle of the income spectrum.
We included that, of course, but our Republican friends in the United
States Senate would not agree to it. This bill will provide for
quality, affordable healthcare to almost every person in the United
States, irrespective of their income.
The national uninsured rate has fallen, as I said, to an all-time low
of 8 percent, with 5.2 million Americans gaining coverage since the
start of the Biden-Harris administration--in large part due to having
made those cost-saving premium tax credits more widely available.
My understanding is our Republican friends are going to vote against
this bill. Millions of people will be unable to afford their insurance.
That is extended by 3 years.
Next, it brings down the cost of prescription drugs by allowing
Medicare for the first time ever--but not uniquely because the Veterans
Affairs does that, and it makes sense--to negotiate lower prices from
manufacturers.
Democrats have been working for decades to achieve this goal. As I
mentioned at the outset of my remarks, our majority is delivering on
that promise.
The bill also caps the cost of insulin at $35 a month. It would have
been extended to everybody, but our Republican friends refuse to
support that alternative, so it is only going to apply to Medicare at
the beginning. We are not going to stop. We also capped the cost at
$2,000 a year for seniors on Medicare. We want to extend that to the
private market as well, and we will work on that.
Madam Speaker, this is a historic achievement that will save lives
and allow more seniors to access life-saving and life-sustaining
medications.
Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act is the largest single
investment addressing the climate crisis that any nation has ever made.
I don't know how it was at your place, but with temperatures of 95, 96,
97, and 98 degrees and high humidity, we have a climate crisis. The
deniers have undermined our ability to respond. This bill responds. It
responds consistent with the desires of the American people.
It will bring down the cost of energy for Americans by investing in
developing and deploying cleaner, more sustainable energy technologies
like electric vehicles and solar panels.
At the same time, we are doing it without raising the deficit. In
fact, the legislation reduces the deficit by closing loopholes so the
largest corporations with profits over a billion dollars will pay a
minimum tax rate of just 15 percent. The rate is 21 percent on
corporations, but if they get over a billion dollars, they are going to
pay at least 15 percent. Why? Because we protect their shipping lanes
with our Navy. We protect their roads that they transport goods across.
They get a lot from their taxes, just as we all do. Maybe that is why
the Republicans don't like this bill.
That is well below the regular 21 percent tax, as I said. We do it
all while ensuring that individuals and families earning less than
$400,000 a year won't see a single tax increase. Let me repeat that.
Nobody making less than $400,000 a year will see a tax increase.
Those four legs: the rescue plan, the infrastructure bill, the CHIPS
bill, and now this reduction in inflation act will provide for growth,
opportunity, and competitiveness for our economy and for our people.
There is, however, another critical piece of legislation that helps
keep that table sturdy. Let us recap this list of major enactments:
Getting Americans back to work from the pandemic. That is what we
did.
Securing long-overdue infrastructure investments. That is what we
did.
Easing the inflation by helping American companies build more chips,
semiconductors, and other critical components here instead of importing
[[Page H7697]]
them from unreliable countries. Over 100,000 new jobs. That is what we
did.
Reducing inflation by lowering healthcare prescription drug and
energy costs while combating the climate crisis. That is what we did.
We will keep on doing it for the American people in the next Congress.
In addition to all these, the Democrat-led House has passed many,
many more important bills that have yet to be considered in the
Senate--blocked by Republicans.
Today, with the Inflation Reduction Act, we will answer any who still
doubt whether we can deliver on our promises.
Today, Democrats and this administration are showing that we can and
will continue to put people over politics and ensure that our people
can make it in America. Vote for America. Vote for the American people.
Vote for this bill.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, to close the debate, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House,
who has done so much to bring this bill to final passage today.
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I thank you for your tremendous leadership
and the other chairs for bringing this legislation to the floor.
The hour is growing late, and as a courtesy to my colleagues, I
intend to shorten my remarks. For those that I shorten the remarks, I
promise to put them in the Record if you promise to read them.
Let me also begin by saying that I associate myself with the remarks
of all of my Democratic colleagues, and that covers a lot of territory.
Madam Speaker, under the visionary leadership of President Biden,
Democrats have forged historic progress for America's families.
First, we enacted our life-saving American Rescue Plan: to propel us
out of the pandemic by putting money in pockets, vaccines in arms,
children safely in school, and people back to work.
Next, we secured the transformative bipartisan infrastructure package
to create good-paying union jobs rebuilding our Nation.
This week, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, which
declares our economic independence, strengthens our national security,
and enhances our families' financial future. We also honored the
valiant service of our men and women in uniform with the PACT Act.
Today, Madam Speaker, is a day of celebration, a day we take another
giant step in our momentous agenda. Our Inflation Reduction Act is a
robust, cost-cutting package that meets the moment: ensuring that our
families thrive and that our planet survives.
This is landmark legislation which we send to the President's desk,
and it is a resounding victory for America's families starting at their
kitchen table. What it means to you--to our constituents, to people out
there whom we serve in terms of healthcare--if you are one of
Medicare's 64 million enrollees, this bill brings down the out-of-
pocket costs in prescription drugs.
We do this by empowering the Secretary of HHS to negotiate lower
prices, at long last. We have been fighting for this for years. We do
so by capping out-of-pocket prescription drug costs. And you, our
constituents, will not pay one more cent for life-saving medication.
This includes a $35 cap on insulin copays.
We do this by banning drug manufacturers from raising prices faster
than inflation, protecting you against predatory price hikes. Make no
mistake: these measures are a big blow to Big Pharma, which has had a
stranglehold for decades, preventing us from making this move. Now we
have relaxed that stranglehold a bit--there is more to be done--but we
give more leverage and more breathing room to America's families.
At the same time, this bill locks in lower premiums that Democrats
secured first in the rescue package. Together, lowering the cost of
prescription drugs and healthcare premiums are vital strides in our
fight for economic justice. This is particularly important to low-
income communities, underserved communities, and communities of color.
In doing so, we honor the call of Dr. King, who said: ``Of all the
forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the
most inhumane because it often results in physical death.''
The inflation bill is a plan divided into three parts: Prescription
drugs and healthcare; second, the most consequential climate action in
the history of our Congress of our country. Doing these two things will
reduce the deficit. At the same time, this legislation advances
President Biden's and Democrats' relentless commitment to putting
justice first.
All of these crucial investments are fully paid for by making sure
the ultra-rich and biggest corporations pay their fair share.
The climate provisions will make a meaningful difference for
America's working families. I am going to put that in the Record, if
you promise to read it, but it is about clean air and clean water for
our children. It is about 9 million good-paying union jobs. It is about
preventing conflict over resources and habitat. It is about values--
values espoused by Pope Francis when he said earlier this summer that
our planet has reached a ``breaking point'' in the fight against
climate crisis. Extreme weather continues to wreak havoc across the
country and around the world, and it is clear the costs of inaction far
outweigh the costs of action.
The bill saves the planet while keeping more money in your pockets.
For working families, you will save an average of $1,000 a year and
lower energy bills. For underserved communities, this bill invests $60
billion in environmental justice initiatives to ensure that everyone
enjoys the benefits of a cleaner, green economy.
{time}  1700
Again, the bill pays down the deficit by $300 billion in the first
decade.
Here is what it means to you: it lowers the deficit and drives down
inflation in the long term.
These monumental investments for families and healthcare are fully
paid for ensuring the biggest corporations and wealthiest pay their
fair share. That is an estimate of about $160 billion a year of taxes
that are unlawfully not paid. Right now families are being harmed by
corporate profiteering.
But let me just say that I don't want you to take it from me. I want
you to take it from a large number of economists--126--including seven
Nobel Prize winners and three former chairs of the Council of Economic
Advisers in a letter urging passage of this bill.
I want you to hear this, my Republican friends, because clearly you
don't know this. But now that you do, perhaps you will change your
comments.
These investments will fight inflation and lower costs for American
families while setting the stage for strong, stable, and broadly-
shared, long-term economic growth.
Madam Speaker, I include in the Record their letter.
August 2, 2022.
Hon. Charles Schumer,
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
Hon. Mitch McConnell,
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. Kevin McCarthy, Minority Leader,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Dear Senate Majority Leader Schumer, Senate Minority Leader
McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, and House Minority Leader
McCarthy: We write to strongly urge you and your colleagues
in Congress to swiftly pass the Inflation Reduction Act of
2022. This historic legislation makes crucial investments in
energy, health care, and in shoring up the nation's tax
system. These investments will fight inflation and lower
costs for American families while setting the stage for
strong, stable, and broadly-shared long-term economic growth.
This legislation represents the single biggest step to date
in tackling the climate crisis. It makes key investments to
incentivize the transition to cleaner energy sources and
greater efficiency. It also invests in the current energy
distribution system to make it more resilient, lowers energy
costs for families, and helps protect U.S. family budgets
against future shocks.
This legislation will quickly and noticeably bring down
health care costs for families. It allows Medicare to
negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies, reduces
Medicare out-of-pocket costs for drugs, and reduces insurance
costs for 13 million Americans by building on provisions in
the Affordable Care Act.
[[Page H7698]]
These investments would be more than fully paid for. The
revenue raised to finance them would come exclusively from
wealthy individuals and corporations. Further, the revenue
stems from enhanced tax enforcement and closing some of the
most distortionary loopholes in the tax code.
This proposal addresses some of the country's biggest
challenges at a significant scale. And because it is deficit-
reducing, it does so while putting downward pressure on
inflation. We strongly recommend Congress act decisively to
build a stronger economy by passing the Inflation Reduction
Act as soon as possible.

Ms. PELOSI. Another point I want to make is I hear them saying that
this is going to be such a thing about the audits. Despite the
Republicans' desperate falsehoods, this bill does not increase IRS
audits on America's working families. The IRS commissioner himself, a
Republican appointed by Donald Trump, said these resources are
absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or
middle-income Americans.
So there you have it.
So I would just say at the end of all of this, I ask these questions:
When you hear about what this means to America's working families,
how can you vote against lowering healthcare costs and prescription
drugs costs for seniors and underserved communities as we continue to
fight inflation?
How can you vote with pharma at the cost of America's seniors and
America's working families?
How can you vote against protecting future generations from rising
sea levels, raging wildfires, and crippling drought?
How can you vote against reducing the deficit and asking
billionaires, companies, and wealthy avoiders of taxes to pay their
fair share?
I am not talking about people who work the system. I am talking about
people who illegally do not pay their taxes.
So, Madam Speaker, every Member of this body is confronted with a
choice. We either put people over politics or politics over people. For
centuries, Members of Congress have stood exactly where we stand facing
the exact same decision as they constructed the pillars of America's
economy and safety: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the
Affordable Care Act, things that the Republicans opposed all along the
way.
This bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, a package for the people,
increases the leverage of the public interest over special interests
and expands the promise of health and financial security now and for
generations to come.
Madam Speaker, I urge every Member to put aside their
misunderstanding of this and vote for the Inflation Reduction Act as we
send this historic legislation to President Biden's desk for signature
this evening for him to sign into law.
Madam Speaker, under the visionary leadership of President Biden,
Democrats have forged historic progress for America's families.
First, we enacted our life-saving American Rescue Plan: to propel us
out of the pandemic by putting money in pockets, vaccines in arms,
children safely back to school and people safely back to work.
Next, we secured a transformative Infrastructure package: to create
good-paying union jobs rebuilding our nation--in a way that strengthens
our middle class, advances justice and protects the environment.
This week, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, which
declares our economic independence, strengthens our national security
and enhances our families' financial future. We also honored the
valiant service of our heroic veterans with the PACT Act.
And today, we proudly take another giant step in our momentous
agenda.
Our Inflation Reduction Act is a robust cost-cutting package that
meets this moment: ensuring that our families thrive and that our
planet survives.
[[Page H7699]]
HEALTH CARE: PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
This landmark legislation, which we send to the President's desk
today, is a resounding victory for America's families--starting at the
kitchen table.
Here's what the Inflation Reduction Act means to you in terms of
health care.
If you are one of Medicare's 64 million enrollees, this bill will
bring down your out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs.
We do so by empowering the HHS Secretary to negotiate for lower drug
prices--a long-standing House Democratic priority.
We do so by capping your out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at
$2,000, so you will not pay one cent more for life-saving medication.
This includes a $35 per month cap on insulin co-pays.
And we do so by banning drug manufactures from raising prices faster
than inflation, protecting you against predatory price hikes.
Make no mistake: these provisions will strike a big blow to Big
Pharma, while giving families more breathing room in their budgets.
HEALTH CARE: ACA SUBSIDIES
At the same time, the Inflation Reduction Act also locks in lower
premiums that Democrats secured in our Rescue package.
If you are one of 13 million working Americans who has affordable
coverage under the ACA: you'll be able to keep your insurance--and
you'll continue to save $800 per year on your premium.
Together, lowering the costs of prescription drugs and health
premiums are vital strides in the fight for economic justice.
Indeed, these benefits will flow heavily to those most in need:
vulnerable seniors, underserved communities and communities of color.
And in doing so, we honor the call of Dr. King, who said: ``Of all
the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and
inhuman because it often results in physical death.''
IRA OVERVIEW
The Inflation Reduction Act is a plan divided into three parts:
first--as I just discussed--lowering the cost of prescription drugs
and health care premiums
second, delivering the most consequential climate action in history
and third, dramatically reducing the deficit.
At the same time, this legislation advances President Biden and
Democrats' relentless commitment to putting justice first.
And all of these crucial investments are fully paid-for by making
sure the ultra-rich and biggest corporations pay their fair share.
To my House Democratic colleagues, make no mistake: this important
progress rests on the foundation that we built--with the Build Back
Better Act last fall and in the last Congress.
So let us salute the tenacious and tireless leadership of our Chairs,
Members and staff, who helped make this joyous day possible.
CLIMATE ACTION
The climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act will also make
a meaningful difference for America's working families.
Our bill cuts carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030--and powers our
nation toward a clean energy future.
It's about health: clean air and clean water for our children
It's about jobs: 9 million good-paying union jobs
It's about security: preventing conflict over resources and habitat
And it's about values: passing on a healthy planet to future
generations
As Pope Francis said earlier this summer, our planet has reached a
``breaking point'' in the fight against the climate crisis. As extreme
weather continues to wreak havoc across our country and around the
world, it is clear the costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of
action.
This bill saves the planet, while keeping more money in your pockets.
For working families: you'll save an average of $1000 per year on
your energy bills by the end of the decade.
For our farmers: this bill supports you in cultivating a diverse,
climate-friendly agriculture system--which will help address food
inflation.
For underserved communities: this bill invests $60 billion in
environmental justice initiatives to ensure everyone will share in the
benefits of our transition to a cleaner, greener economy.
In doing so, we ensure we not only mitigate a far more catastrophic
future--but build a safe, sustainable planet for our children and
grandchildren.
DEFICIT REDUCTION
America's working families will also greatly benefit from the
Inflation Reduction Act's historic investment to get our fiscal house
in order.
This bill pays down the deficit by $300 billion over the first
decade.
And nonpartisan analysis shows that it will reduce the deficit by
nearly $2 trillion over two decades decade.
Here's what that means to you: slashing the deficit will drive down
inflation in the long-term.
This builds on the progress Democrats have already forged: with our
nation on track to slash the deficit by a record $1.5 trillion this
year alone.
Meanwhile, Democrats' record of fiscal responsibility stands in sharp
contrast to the Trump Tax Scam, which ballooned the deficit by nearly
$2 trillion and left working families behind.
PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE
These monumental investments for our families--in health care,
climate action and deficit reduction--are fully paid for by ensuring
the biggest corporations and the wealthiest few pay their fair share.
Right now, families are being harmed by corporate profiteering with
impunity: billion-dollar companies paying little-to-no taxes, while
jacking up prices and refusing to fairly pay their workers.
That's why we're closing loopholes by implementing: a 15 percent
corporate minimum tax only on billion-dolar companies; and a 1 percent
tax on stock buybacks, which enrich executives and shareholders.
We're also taking on ultra-rich tax cheats, ensuring they can't
continue to dodge what they owe to our nation: an estimated $160
billion each year.
Let me be clear: this bill does not raise taxes on anyone making less
than $400,000 a year, honoring the President's promise to America's
families.
And despite Republicans' desperate falsehoods, this bill does not
increase IRS audits on America's working families.
Treasury Secretary Yellen has directed the IRS Commissioner not to
increase the audit rate for households making under $400,000 a year.
And the IRS Commissioner himself--a Republican appointed by Trump--
said: ``These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit
scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income Americans.''
FIGHTING INFLATION
The provisions in this legislation are a powerful force to fight
inflation.
It is encouraging that prices at the pump have fallen for nearly
sixty days straight--and that the latest data shows 0 percent inflation
in July.
But Democrats know that higher prices still weigh heavy on America's
families. And now, we take another strong step to further drive down
kitchen table costs.
OUTSIDE SUPPORT
But don't take my word for it.
Take the word of 126 economists--including seven Nobel Prize winners,
three former chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers and two farmer
Treasury Secretaries.
In a letter urging passage of this bill, they wrote: ``These
investments will fight inflation and lower costs for American
families--while setting the stage for strong, stable, and broadly-
shared long-term economic growth.''
PUBLIC SUPPORT
And proudly, the American people are with us:
Three-quarters support our action to lower prescription drug costs,
Two-thirds support our clean energy provisions,
60 percent support billion-dollar companies paying their fair share.
GOP OPPOSITION
But sadly, our colleagues across the aisle clearly prefer to keep
costs for families sky-high.
Senate Republicans unanimously voted against this bill. And now,
House Republican Leaders are whipping against it.
Their opposition is unconscionable.
How could anyone vote against lowering health care costs on seniors
and underserved communities as we continue to fight inflation?
How could anyone vote against protecting future generations from
rising sea levels, raging wildfires and crippling droughts?
How could anyone vote against reducing the deficit or asking
billiondollar companies and wealthy tax cheats to pay their fair share?
CLOSE: PEOPLE OVER POLITICS
Madam Speaker, today, every Member of this body will be confronted
with a basic choice. Will you put People Over Politics--or Politics
Over People?
For centuries, Members of Congress have stood exactly where we stand
now, facing this exact same decision, as they constructed the pillars
of the American economy and society. Social
[[Page H7700]]
Security. Medicare and Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act.
Today, the Congress carries forward this all-American tradition.
The Inflation Reduction Act is a package For The People:
Increasing the leverage of the public interest over the special
interest,
And expanding the promise of health and financial security, now and
for generations to come.
So I urge every Member to put aside partisan difference--put People
Over Politics--and vote YES on the Inflation Reduction Act, as we send
this historic legislation to President Biden's desk for his signature.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, today, I rise in strong support of the
Inflation Reduction Act--landmark legislation that will have a lasting
impact on our planet and help lower costs for Americans in New York
City and across our country. From lowering prescription drug prices and
health care costs for working families to including the most
significant climate investment in our nation's history, the Inflation
Reduction Act includes policies I have long fought for.
With this legislation, our nation can finally rise to the seriousness
of the moment in our fight against climate change by making the large-
scale investments needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40
percent by 2030, lower energy costs for families, and create millions
of good-paying clean energy jobs across our country.
I am thrilled that with this legislation, our government will finally
be able to negotiate the prices of some of our nation's costliest
prescription drugs--drugs that have been on the market for years and
reap billions of dollars in sales from Medicare alone. I am proud that
the Inflation Reduction Act will bring down health care costs for over
3.7 million New Yorkers and will result in enormous savings for
taxpayers.
With the passage of this bill, Democrats are showing American
families that our federal government can deliver for the people, not
just special corporate interests.
I look forward to voting to pass this historic legislation.
Mr. DAVID Scott of Georgia. Madam Speaker, the Inflation Reduction
Act of 2022 before us today makes historic investments in climate
change mitigation, our critical forestry and conservation programs,
rural communities, and energy and biofuels infrastructure.
This package makes important investments in our oversubscribed farm
bill conservation programs. By expanding participation in these
programs and providing increased technical assistance funding, farmers
will more readily be able to employ proven conservation practices on
their land, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and sequester carbon. I
have always believed that agriculture should be the tip of the spear in
addressing the harmful effects of climate change. This legislation
helps make that a reality.
My colleagues may complain about the steps we had to take to ensure
this additional funding for our farm bill conservation programs, I
would note that our colleagues on the other side have similarly
extended the authorization of farm bill authorizations, but in those
cases, it was to cut funding from them. In this exercise, we are
including additional funding, which will be beneficial as we look to
writing the 2023 Farm Bill.
Major investments in forestry will also help to combat climate
change, reduce risk of catastrophic wildfire, and ensure that our
public and private lands have the tools they need to continue to serve
as our largest carbon sinks. In addition to the carbon benefits, this
bill helps restore forest ecosystems, improve watershed health, and
enhance wildlife habitat by providing much needed funding.
Additionally, the forestry provisions of the bill will help bring rural
prosperity to many parts of our Nation by ensuring that we are
developing new, innovative, wood products, and by making sure that
underserved communities can benefit from emerging climate mitigation
markets. This bill makes sure that urban communities have access to
forestry programs by providing needed funding for Urban and Community
Forestry. Expanding the tree canopy in urban areas is one of the
cheapest and most effective ways to address temperature impacts and air
quality issues, and I'm sorry some of my colleagues don't recognize
that.
The Inflation Reduction Act's investments in rural communities,
energy, and biofuels will help lower energy bills, increase the
efficiency of energy systems, and provide opportunities for farmers and
small business owners to employ emission reducing technology in their
operations. Increasing energy efficiency is good for their bottom lines
and good for the climate. This legislation also provides significant
support for rural electric cooperatives as they transition to renewable
and zero emission energy systems, and it also increases access to clean
biofuels across the nation.
This bill provides expedited relief to direct and guaranteed farm
loan borrowers at risk of losing their farming operations. It also
allows USDA to help farmers and ranchers who have suffered
discrimination in Farm Service Agency farm loan programs. It requires
USDA to use one or more nongovernmental entities to help provide this
assistance.
Lastly, it builds upon the American Rescue Plan efforts to increase
access to capital and land for our beginning and underserved producers
by expanding access to technical assistance, financial training,
cooperative development, and assistance to address heirs' property
issues. And part of this effort includes bolstering the capacity at our
1890 and 1994 Land Grant, Insular Area, and other Minority-Serving
Institutions in the areas of research, education and extension.
I want to thank the Members of the Agriculture Committee for their
hard work on this legislation. And I also want to thank the Agriculture
Committee staff who have dedicated many hours over the last year to
helping see this legislation through to its passage today.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I want to
highlight the long-overdue reforms contained in this legislation to
make lifesaving medicine affordable for the millions of Medicare
beneficiaries in this country.
First, it will cap copayments for insulin products at $35 per month.
My Committee's investigation found that, since the 1990s, insulin
manufacturers have been raising the price of this life-saving medicine,
despite no improvements to the drug, while making record profits. This
price gouging has harmed Americans, and capping out-of-pocket costs is
an important step to reducing insulin costs for seniors and people with
disabilities.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also an incredible step forward in our
efforts to protect Americans from being overburdened with high out-of-
pocket costs and healthcare-related expenses. For the first time, it
would limit a beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs
covered by Medicare Part D to $2,000 a year. My Committee's
investigation found that drug companies' price increases have imposed
thousands of dollars in annual out-of-pocket costs on patients,
especially for drugs that treat cancer or chronic conditions. This
annual cap will provide much-needed financial protection, especially
for the millions of beneficiaries who take high price drugs for cancer,
rare diseases, or chronic conditions.
Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act will make health insurance
coverage more affordable for millions of Americans by extending key
Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits through 2025, building on the
important progress made by the American Rescue Plan signed into law
last March. By providing tax credits for millions of consumers
purchasing coverage through an ACA marketplace, the American Rescue
Plan expanded access to health insurance and made it significantly more
affordable.
Since passage of the American Rescue Plan, four out of five consumers
were able to find an ACA marketplace plan for $10 or less per month.
These savings allowed nearly 6 million new consumers to sign up for
marketplace coverage during the first year of the Biden-Harris
Administration. This year, a record 14.5 million consumers have signed
up for marketplace coverage, and the national uninsured rate recently
reached a record low of 8.0 percent. The Inflation Reduction Act
extends these critical benefits for millions of Americans, and
continues our work to ensure that all people in this country have
access to health insurance coverage.
As Chairwoman, I was also proud to include $50 million dollars in the
Inflation Reduction Act to ensure that the economic and environmental
benefits of funding across the Inflation Reduction Act are spread
equitably. For decades, low-income communities and communities of color
have suffered from chronic underinvestment while being forced to suffer
the most severe health and economic impacts of pollution and climate
change.
We won't stand for that any longer. The Inflation Reduction Act will
lower costs, create better-paying jobs, and build healthier, more
sustainable communities. With my Committee's oversight funding
included, we can make sure these benefits are being spread fairly and
that clean energy investments support environmental justice communities
that need them the most.
Finally, my Committee worked to include almost a billion dollars to
support for the deployment of emerging sustainable technologies to
reduce emissions while also saving taxpayer dollars. This good
government provision will support innovation to drive down the cost of
clean energy solutions, which is better for consumers and better for
our children's future.
This is all accomplished alongside inflation-fighting measures that
will cut the nation's deficit by a historic $300 billion without
raising taxes on small businesses or on a single person or family in
the middle class. The Inflation Reduction Act closes loopholes that
have allowed billionaire corporations to avoid paying their minimum
fair share of income tax.
[[Page H7701]]
Thanks to this transformative legislation and today's historic vote,
those days are behind us, and better days of a more fair and prosperous
nation are ahead. It is an honor to send this legislation to the
President's desk.
Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.
5376, the Inflation Reduction Act. For years, Americans have faced
rising costs at grocery stores, pharmacies, and in recent months, at
the gas pump. Today, we will send this legislation to the President's
desk to be signed into law so we can provide necessary relief to
hardworking people across the country.
The Inflation Reduction Act takes historic steps to reduce the
deficit and fight inflation, invest in domestic energy production and
manufacturing, and tackle the climate crisis by reducing carbon
emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030. The bill will also lower
prescription drug and health care costs by finally allowing Medicare to
negotiate prescription drug prices and extending the expanded
Affordable Care Act program for three years.
Notably, this legislation makes sure that the biggest corporations
and billionaires pay taxes. It establishes a 15 percent corporate
minimum tax and invests in Internal Revenue Service tax enforcement to
ensure that the biggest corporations, the ultra-wealthy, and rich tax
cheats pay their fair share. Large corporations have been using
inflation as an excuse to abuse their market power, jacking up prices
for American consumers at the grocery store, the pharmacy, and at the
gas pump. This law puts taxpayer dollars back into the pockets of
working families.
My vote today comes with a promise to my constituents in Connecticut
and to the American people--I will continue the fight for common sense,
proven solutions like the Child Tax Credit in the days and weeks to
come. As I have said before, as American families face rising costs,
the expanded Child Tax Credit is one of our best tools to help them
face these challenges. We still have so much work to do to address the
problems being faced today by working families.
Today is an important step forward, and I am proud to cast my vote in
support of this critical legislation.
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition of what I call
the Inflation ``Production'' Act.
There are obvious problems of increasing taxes in a recession,
expanding Obamacare, innovation killing price controls on drugs, and
its attacks on American energy.
Hard working families, farmers, and small business owners in central
Arkansas are going to bear the brunt of citizens being audited at the
highest rates due to more than doubling the size of the IRS and it's
increase in funding.
What do we think the IRS is going to do with this increase in staff
and $45 billion in new enforcement funding?
No agency needs six times its current funding to answer phone calls
and improve customer service.
I have seen claims that as long as you don't cheat on your taxes then
you have nothing to worry about.
Clearly, they have never faced the harassment and excruciating
process of an IRS audit.
We must defeat this legislation.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I ran for Congress to
help people in Chicago, in Illinois, and across the country. The
Inflation Reduction Act represents a transformative investment in
families, workers, businesses, and the planet that will improve health
and well-being, advance economic and environmental justice,
meaningfully address climate change, and grow our economy while asking
the wealthiest and most secure to pay their fair share.
As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I am deeply honored to
have played an active role in advancing these policies that improve the
health of Americans, workers, our economy, and the environment. The
pandemic has harmed tens of millions of Americans--disproportionately
hurting African Americans and other communities of color, women,
seniors, and children. This bill meets immediate needs for lower costs
for health care, medications, and energy as well as long-term needs for
good-paying jobs, a healthy environment, a fairer tax system, and
deficit and inflation reduction.
As a former health care professional, I am proud to vote for this
bill that would achieve several important goals in healthcare. The
Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) would have the power to
negotiate certain high-cost prescription drugs for seniors and people
with disabilities that are Medicare beneficiaries. It would enhance
premium tax credits, subsidies for people who buy insurance on the
Affordable Care Act marketplaces, for three additional years. This is
to extend the enacted legislative measure by Congress and President
Biden last year to help people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medicare
recipients would not have to pay more than $35 per month of their out-
of-pocket costs for insulin. Drug companies will have to pay a rebate
to Medicare if their prices increase faster than inflation, and place
caps on Medicare Part D out-of-pocket drug purchases at $2,000 yearly.
There will be no copayments for vaccines in Medicare Part D, Medicaid
and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Each of these
health provisions directly helps people spend less of their money on
healthcare costs and slows the price increases of medicines, giving
Chicagoans, Illinoisans, and Americans extra money to meet their needs
and improve their well-being.
As the representative of communities harmed by high energy costs and
pollution, I am proud to vote for this bill that will save the average
American household hundreds in energy bills, reduce emissions by 40
percent by 2030, generate enormous public health benefits via reduced
air pollution, and grow our clean energy economy by spurring 9 million
jobs.
I am pleased that this legislation includes my bill, the Low-Income
Housing Renewable Energy Credit Act (LIHREC) of 2021, to provide a
larger tax credit for those businesses investing in new wind and solar
projects in low-to-moderate income (LMI) communities. I am confident
that this provision will help the tax code advance environmental and
economic justice by bringing the economic and environmental benefits of
solar energy to low-income individuals and communities, spreading the
benefits of clean and affordable energy to households like those that I
represent that have far too often been neglected by clean energy
providers. Current renewable tax benefits typically remain out of reach
for low-income communities, which also experience greater power-
generated pollution. The new provision would provide an enhanced
Investment Tax Credit to solar projects benefiting low-income
residents, including multifamily housing, community solar homes, and
individual low-income residential homeowners.
Some of the leading companies in this sector have raised the need for
additional guidance related to the use of the credit for projects
benefiting low-income homeowners to ensure that the program within the
reconciliation bill will provide environmental justice allocations in a
manner that provide businesses sufficient certainty to make the
necessary investments in LMI communities. The central concern is
clarity that businesses offering rooftop solar to LMI homeowners will
receive the credit allocation prior to engaging with potential
customers so that businesses can honestly convey the expected energy
costs. Critical to the success of this new program will be
participation by those businesses providing residential rooftop solar.
My intent in drafting the LIHREC Act, the basis for the provision
included in the reconciliation bill, was to ensure that residential
rooftop solar businesses would be in a position to leap into service of
LMI communities when the bill is signed into law. As such, the
legislation is designed to provide maximum flexibility to Treasury in
designing the application and allocation process for the bonus 10
percent credit. Specifically, the legislation is intended to allow
residential rooftop providers to identify potential customers in
qualifying census tracts and submit applications to serve these
customers up-front, before these businesses have engaged these
potential customers. My understanding is that these businesses will
need to know if they have received a credit allocation before they can
offer the benefits of rooftop solar to new customers in LMI areas to
provide accurate pricing information to low-income customers. Without
certainty in the availability of the credit allocation, low-income
homeowners are at risk of entering deals with shifting costs or of not
having the opportunities at all given the uncertainty for businesses.
So today, I make clear my understanding that the negotiated text gives
Treasury the necessary flexibility to award allocations up-front so
that businesses can make new investments in LMI communities knowing
that they will be in a position to claim the bonus credit.
I also received questions from an insurance company in Illinois about
whether companies that only prepare what is known as statutory
accounting statements would be required to produce GAAP statements or a
hybrid of GAAP. It is my understanding that the legislation provides
that applicable financial statements required to be filed with state
insurance regulators will be recognized as applicable financial
statements for purposes of the new book minimum tax. State insurance
regulators already are subject to a robust regulatory financial
statement requirement to ensure the continued protection of insurance
consumers. After enactment, I will work to convey this understanding to
the executive branch.
I am honored to vote for this once-in-a-generation legislation. I
came to Congress to make this type of momentous change. I urge my
colleagues to pass it.
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I would like to clarify for any of my
colleagues who might be concerned that these three offshore
[[Page H7702]]
lease sales provided through the Inflation Reduction Act are somehow
being rushed through or will be conducted with insufficient
administrative process. That is simply not the case.
These sales were scheduled under the Obama Administration under the
2017-2022 five-year plan. That Interior department subjected the plan
to a large programmatic environmental impact statement. They then
underwent a multi-sale EIS. These sales then also went through a
supplemental EIS. Thus, the idea that any further process should be
required is just not credible and that is why the bill requires them to
occur by a date certain.
It is in our national interest to do so as quickly as possible so
that the energy crisis does not become even worse and so that the fuel
and revenue these sales will generate can find their way into our
economy sooner than later.
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the
Inflation Reduction Act we are considering today and would like to
speak specifically to the inclusion of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction
Fund, which is based on important legislation I authored to address the
climate crisis.
The Inflation Reduction Act appropriates $27 billion to the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finance climate specific
projects that will reduce carbon emissions, which will be dispensed
through the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reduction Fund. The GHG Reduction Fund
is the product of more than 13 years of legislative effort by numerous
members of the House and Senate and provides resources to fulfill the
vision and mission of this legislative effort to capitalize a national
climate bank that will support a swift transition to an equitable,
clean-energy economy,
In the House, the GHG Reduction Fund is based on H.R. 806, the Clean
Energy and Sustainability Accelerator Act. I introduced this important
legislation to provide the maximum funding possible to and capitalize a
single independent, non-profit national financing institution
(``NNFI'')--the first ever national green bank--that would in turn make
its financial and technical resources available to communities across
the country. It is our hope, as the administration implements the GHG
Reduction Fund, it will consider the benefits and structure of the
Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator Act.
It is our hope the Environmental Protection Agency would make awards
through the GHG Reduction Fund to capitalize a single NNFI, as intended
under the Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator Act, and for that
NNFI to use that capitalization funding to leverage private investment
in amounts several times greater than the initial public investment.
Once capitalized, the bill requires the entity to make direct
investments into qualified projects at the national, regional, state,
and local levels and, importantly, to make indirect investments into
such projects by providing financial and technical assistance to an
open, inclusive, and ever-expanding network of state and local
nonprofit financial institutions--including existing and newly
established green banks and community development finance
institutions--that are committed to making investments in the products
that will compose the clean power platform on which the economy must
run.
The GHG Reduction Fund makes an historic investment into low income
and disadvantaged communities as well, mandating that at least 40
percent of the over $20 billion be used to benefit qualified projects
and the financing entities that support qualified projects within these
communities, but we expect that the full investment in these
communities will be far larger through leverage and investments from
the remainder of the Fund.
The GHG Reduction Fund, and the American people, would benefit most
and achieve its purpose most effectively through the capitalization of
a single independent NNFI, as originally intended in the Clean Energy
and Sustainability Accelerator Act. A single independent NNFI will not
be limited by any jurisdictional boundary--no community is beyond its
reach. Therefore, the NNFI approach could directly invest in qualified
projects anywhere in the United States that would otherwise lack
funding. In addition, the NNFI approach can indirectly invest in any
community by providing the funding and technical assistance necessary
to establish new financial institutions and further capitalize and
strengthen existing ones. The NNFI would grow a diverse, open, and
inclusive network of state and local green banks and other mission
driven financing entities.
Capitalizing a single independent NNFI at scale, through the GHG
Reduction Fund, would also enable public investment to be leveraged
more efficiently which, in turn, drives much greater private capital
investment in qualified projects, whether at the national, regional,
state, or local level. And the Inflation Reduction Act requires the
entity to ``retain, manage, recycle, and monetize all repayments and
other revenue'' generated using the capitalization grant. We count on
EPA to assure that the NNFI will be subject to the appropriate
regulations and requirements that would apply to similar non-profit
institutions that have been capitalized with federal or nonfederal
dollars. At the same time, the relationship between EPA and the single
independent nonprofit national financing institution should be designed
to preserve its operational flexibility and ability to respond quickly
to market conditions to execute with the speed that the climate crisis
demands.
Finally, the Inflation Reduction Act sets a 180-day period for EPA to
complete all these steps: establish the GHG Reduction Fund, issue a
grant solicitation, award capitalization grants, and disburse the
funds. These aggressive deadlines were established because the GHG
Reduction Fund cannot achieve its purpose unless the full amount of
funds appropriated to this program are put into use through a NNFI
approach immediately. Disbursing all the funds within 180 days though a
single independent NNFI, as originally intended under the Clean Energy
and Sustainability Accelerator Act will ensure that we can
expeditiously address the urgent threat of catastrophic climate change,
in an equitable manner, on day 181. A swift disbursement of the maximum
funding amount possible will allow the climate bank to leverage more
private financing--thereby ensuring our public investment has a far
reaching impact.
The impacts of climate change have created an emergency situation
that poses a substantial danger to the health and safety of the
American public, and the award and disbursement of the maximum amount
of funds appropriated to the GHG Reduction Fund cannot be delayed. We
recognize that the timeline will require EPA, at every step in the
grant process, to evaluate approaches that can reduce the amount of
time that it would otherwise take to complete that step--and it is our
intention that EPA will utilize all legally-authorized strategies that
are necessary to ensure the full amount of the funding is disbursed on
time.
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam Speaker, I strongly support H.R.
5376, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
I am particularly pleased that the legislation before the House
includes major provisions of my GREEN Act, including incentives for a
vast array of clean and renewable energy sources.
This legislation represents the most sweeping and ambitious climate
policy ever to pass the Congress.
It reduces our dependence on fossil fuels while accelerating the
development of solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources.
And it incentivizes individuals to limit greenhouse gas emissions
from their homes, their businesses, and their vehicles.
I am also extremely supportive of the health care provisions in this
bill.
Allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs has
been a priority for Democrats in Congress for decades--and this bill
not only ensures that seniors don't go broke paying for their
medicines, but also saves taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.
Given the negotiations of the past 18 months, this bill could not
accommodate every single priority or proposal.
And I am hopeful that my colleagues will work with me moving forward
to ensure that the corporate minimum tax--a policy I support--does not
inadvertently burden companies, like some in my district, who suffered
severe net operating losses in previous years due to natural disaster.
This bill is a tremendous step forward for our country. It pays down
our deficit, reduces the cost of prescription drugs, extends health
insurance subsidies for low-income Americans and invests hundreds of
billions of dollars in clean and renewable energy.
I am proud to have helped author this legislation, and I strongly
support its passage.
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, as many of my colleagues know, I have
worked for years to protect patient access to pharmacies across this
nation. It is the intent of the United States House that this
legislation, and in particular, Section 1860D-14C(c). MANUFACTURER
DISCOUNT PROGRAM shall operate in the same manner as the Medicare Part
D Coverage Gap Discount Program found under 42 USC 1395w-114a. CMS
shall implement this provision to operate in the same manner with
respect to a pharmacy. In that way, this section shall not result in
any reduction in pharmacy reimbursement or require or permit price
concessions or other remuneration from the pharmacy. We will convey
this intent to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as they
develop the rules that will govern this discount program. I will
continue to look for additional ways to help patients and to preserve
and protect our pharmacies that are so essential to communities across
Vermont and our country.
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of a
transformational piece of legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act.
The Inflation Reduction Act's historic investments will reduce costs
for families and individuals, expand access to affordable health
[[Page H7703]]
care, strengthen domestic energy production and manufacturing, and
reduce the federal deficit. This plan will also reduce carbon emissions
to address the climate crisis and move us toward a better, healthier,
and more secure future for Oregonians and people across the country.
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic exacerbated longstanding economic
inequities, and working families have been facing the consequences.
Economic inflation caused by increased consumer demand, global supply
chain disruptions, and Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine have
shifted global markets, affecting everyday costs. Higher prices are
straining household budgets and depriving workers of the full benefits
of our growing economy. The Inflation Reduction Act will lower costs
for health care, prescription drugs, and consumer energy, and make
robust investments in energy security and climate solutions, including
for disadvantaged and rural communities.
In the Pacific Northwest, climate change is not a distant threat;
it's our current reality. The Inflation Reduction Act acknowledges the
scale of the climate crisis by investing nearly $375 billion in a clean
energy future. It will lower consumer energy costs with clean energy
tax credits, and decarbonize every sector of the economy to reduce 40
percent of U.S. carbon emissions by 2030. Importantly, the Inflation
Reduction Act will invest $60 billion in environmental justice and
climate resilient solutions through sustainable agriculture, coastal,
home energy, and transportation priorities to bolster rural communities
and individuals disproportionately affected by climate change. Through
economy-wide investments in agriculture, coastal restoration, energy,
manufacturing, and transportation, this pivotal legislation will help
the U.S. combat climate change while creating new, good paying jobs and
mitigating climate inequities.
Everyone in the United States should have access to quality,
affordable health care. To make health care more affordable, the
Inflation Reduction Act will extend important health policies passed in
the American Rescue Plan for an additional three years. These policies
include eliminating the cap on subsidies for health insurance coverage
under the Affordable Care Act, which will benefit up to four million
Americans. Additionally, rising prescription drug costs are a burden
for many Americans, particularly seniors. Too often, excessive drug
prices force families to choose between their health and other
necessities, like food and housing. That's unacceptable. The Inflation
Reduction Act will reduce the price of prescription drugs by allowing
Medicare to negotiate drug prices for certain medications, and will cap
seniors' out-of-pocket costs to $2,000 a year. The bill also caps
insulin costs at $35 per month for Medicare beneficiaries. The
Inflation Reduction Act will stabilize Medicare Part D by holding
annual premium growth to current levels, which will incentivize drug
manufacturers and insurers to keep drug prices low.
These historic investments will be paid for by making our tax code
more progressive, rather than regressive. With the tax provisions in
this bill, the very largest corporations, currently contributing as
little as one percent in taxes, will pay a minimum rate rather than
take advantage of loopholes. After the Republicans' 2017 tax bill was
signed into law, corporations spent more than $1 trillion on stock
buybacks in 2018. The Inflation Reduction Act will help correct the
missed opportunities of the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by
establishing a tax on stock buybacks. It will also strengthen the
Internal Revenue Service to enforce existing tax laws, improve customer
service, speed access to tax refunds, and reduce abuse of the tax code.
Improving tax fairness will bolster domestic investments in our economy
while also reducing the deficit.
The Inflation Reduction Act makes tremendous progress, but it does
not address all of the important priorities of the people of NW Oregon
and across the country, including needed investments in workforce
development and child care. I will continue working on those important
priorities, but in the meantime, I look forward to making significant
progress by working with my colleagues in Congress and partners in the
Biden-Harris Administration to pass the Inflation Reduction Act.
