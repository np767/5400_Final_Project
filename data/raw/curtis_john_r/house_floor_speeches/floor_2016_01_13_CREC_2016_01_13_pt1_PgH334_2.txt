RECOGNIZING GABRIELLA MELENDEZ, TORIANA CORNWELL, AND SHANIYLAH WELCH
(Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, three students from the
Hamlin Park Academy--Gabriella Melendez, Toriana Cornwell, and
Shaniylah Welch--will participate in the Fourth Annual State of
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Address hosted by the White
House.
After months of planning, fundraising, and research, these three
bright women partnered with Western New York STEM Hub to develop and
fine-tune their experiment, ``Tumor Growth in Microgravity,'' which
earned them the nickname ``Spud Launchers.''
Through collaborative efforts with NASA, these spud launchers will
test the ability of potatoes to grow in microgravity, toward the goal
of learning about how plants might grow on other planets.
Their experiment won the national competition held by the Student
Spaceflight Experiments Program and will be conducted abroad at the
International Space Station this year.
These three young women are role models to all of the bright young
minds in our community. Their success is a result of their curiosity
and their hard work. It is a testament to their families, the Buffalo
Public Schools system, Western New York STEM Hub, and, most
importantly, their teachers.
