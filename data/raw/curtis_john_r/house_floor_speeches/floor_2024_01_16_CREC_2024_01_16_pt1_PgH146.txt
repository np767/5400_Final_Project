HONORING GOLD MEDAL RECIPIENT AND GREAT AMERICAN LANCE CORPORAL JOSEPH
BARNA
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I was reminded recently by my very good
friend and great American, Tiffany Cloud, of another great American
from my district, an avid writer and Marine Corps veteran, Lance
Corporal Joseph Barna, whom I was pleased to meet several years ago.
Joe recently won a national gold medal for his essay ``Our Life Is
About Memories'' in the prestigious 2023 Veterans Administration
creative arts contest. This impressive feat marks his fourth national
gold medal in this highly competitive veteran writing contest.
Joe Barna served our country with honor during the Korean war with
the 1st Marine Division, 1st Regiment, 1st Battalion, Baker Company,
Anti-Assault Platoon.
He writes essays, and he wrote a book, ``God Makes Angels and Navy
Corpsmen: A Korean War Veteran's Memories of the War and Life.''
Joe also uses his writing talents to actively promote veteran causes
throughout our community. He is all about America, and he is all about
veterans.
Mr. Speaker, today on the House floor, I am not only honored to
recognize Lance Corporal Joseph Barna, but I strongly encourage all
Americans to read the essay ``Our Life Is About Memories.'' It is sad,
heartwarming, patriotic, and written by a great American.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Barna for his service.
