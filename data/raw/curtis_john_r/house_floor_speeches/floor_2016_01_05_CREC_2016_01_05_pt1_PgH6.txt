HONORING KEVIN KLINE AND THE SNOWDROP FOUNDATION
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, in the movie ``Forrest Gump,'' Tom Hanks runs
for over 3 years.
A good friend of mine is like Forrest Gump. His name is Kevin Kline.
He is a DJ on the 93Q morning radio show. His partners, Erica Rico and
Tim Tuttle, call him Kevin Gump or Forrest Kline. Why? Because for 55
hours over New Year's, Kevin and others ran, walked, or crawled to save
kids with cancer.
With his wife, Trish, Kevin started the Snowdrop Foundation because
cancer touched a 16-year-old, who lost her life, named Chelsey
Campbell. Snowdrop has raised over $1 million in just 9 short years.
They did this to ensure no child or parent hears those three awful
words, ``You have cancer.''
All Texans are proud of Kevin and Trish and Snowdrop. To quote
Kevin's idol: ``That's all I have to say about that.''
