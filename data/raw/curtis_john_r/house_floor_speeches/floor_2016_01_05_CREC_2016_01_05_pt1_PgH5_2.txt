BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR GUN OWNERSHIP
(Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of President Obama's
announcement today to fight the growing epidemic of gun violence in
America and make our families more secure and communities safer.
It is just common sense that background checks should be required
before an individual is allowed to buy a firearm, yet Congress refuses
to pass legislation to close loopholes that allow gun sales to proceed
before background checks are completed.
Under the so-called Charleston loophole that contributed to the mass
murder of nine of my constituents, sales can proceed after 3 days, even
when the background check is not complete. That is just wrong. My bill,
the Background Check Completion Act, will ensure that background checks
are completed before sales take place.
I thank the President for his leadership today, and I call on my
colleagues, many of whom seem to default to ``no,'' no matter how
reasonable the proposed legislation may be, when all else fails, employ
common sense.
