ALBERTSONS-KROGER MERGER
(Mrs. PELTOLA asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Mrs. PELTOLA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend Alaska's rights to
affordable groceries, which are under threat from a corporate mega-
merger.
The Albertsons-Kroger merger would combine Alaska's two largest
grocery stores. Many of our communities just have two grocers, a Carrs-
Safeway and a Fred Meyer, often across the street, whether it is
Airport Way in Fairbanks or the Sterling Highway in Soldotna.
If they merge, 14 of these stores will be sold to a company that has
never operated in Alaska. That matters.
Alaska is a remote State with one-of-a-kind logistical challenges. We
know what happened in the 1999 Carrs-Safeway merger, when a new
operator had to close its stores after barely a year. Alaskans got
higher prices and fewer choices.
We won't be ignored this time. We are asking the Federal Trade
Commission to listen to our voices, stop this merger, and protect our
access to food and jobs.
As the FTC meets this week, Alaskans will be speaking up, asking them
to do the right thing and listen to those who have the most to lose.
