PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ACTION ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Bost) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week the President took aim at
our Second Amendment rights.
We know his purpose was to restrict the constitutional right of law-
abiding citizens. It will undermine our personal privacy rights. It
will make it to where due process is taken away from many of our
citizens, but it won't stop criminals from carrying firearms. As a
father and as a grandfather, my heart is broken over the many tragedies
and attacks that have occurred around this Nation, but this won't cure
the problem.
In this Congress, we must fight for the rights of our Constitution.
We must also use the courts to fight for those rights. We must do more.
Mr. Speaker, not only I, but you and every Member of this Congress,
took an oath of office when we took these positions. We took that oath,
and it was to uphold and to defend the Constitution, all of the
Constitution, not just the First Amendment, but the Second Amendment as
well and every part thereof.
When I took that oath, I took it very, very seriously. I am doing my
part. I am upholding the oath that I took. I believe the President
should uphold his.
