VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION IS NOT THE ANSWER
(Mr. MULLIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the Constitution is
under attack by a President who has never respected the Second
Amendment.
Gun ownership is a fundamental right of law-abiding Americans. The
Supreme Court affirmed this right in 2010, and yet this week the
President issued new executive actions that are unconstitutional and a
clear abuse of power.
There is no question that we must stop senseless acts of violence,
but violating the Constitution is not the answer. Criminals are
criminals because they break the law. More laws won't keep guns out of
criminals' hands.
Let's let law enforcement do their job and enforce the laws that we
already have. Let's let law enforcement address the root cause of the
violence. Let's look at what is causing it, like radicalism and mental
illness.
I have no doubt that the President's latest actions will be
challenged in court.
I will do everything in my power to protect Oklahoma's rights and the
rights of all Americans.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The Chair
will remind Members to refrain from engaging in personalities toward
the President.
While Members may criticize the President's policies or official
actions, they may not engage in personal attacks.
