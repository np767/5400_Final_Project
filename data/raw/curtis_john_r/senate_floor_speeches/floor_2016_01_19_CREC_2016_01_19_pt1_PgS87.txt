TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST INDIA
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I condemn the recent terrorist attack on
the Indian Pathankot Air Force Station, which took the lives of seven
Indian security force personnel, as well as the attack on the Indian
Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan. These deplorable acts of
aggression threaten to undermine India's security and also its peaceful
activities in Afghanistan, which are in the interests of both nations,
as well as the United States.
It is my understanding that a Pakistan-based terrorist group is
likely responsible for the attack, and it is imperative that these
terrorists be brought to justice. The United States must stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with India in facing this common security threat.
As violent, Islamic extremism emanating from Pakistan continues to
threaten the long-term stability of the region, it is increasingly
important that Pakistan reject such aggression and do everything in its
power to root out and eliminate these terrorists.
