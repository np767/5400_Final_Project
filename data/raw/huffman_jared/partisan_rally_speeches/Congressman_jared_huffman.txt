 Good morning and welcome to the Nature Conservancy's California Determining Decade Town Hall. We're very fortunate today to have Congressman Jared Huffman joining us for a Town Hall discussion to take your questions and thinking about our environment and climate change amid this COVID crisis. And I want to take a moment to thank all of you for taking time out of your schedule to participate in this discussion with us. We know this is a very challenging time. All of us are learning new ways of communicating, new ways of working, trying to figure out how we deal with our day-to-day lives in a very unprecedented moment. And Congressman Huffman, thank you for taking time to join us. I want to just say a couple words about the Nature Conservancy here. Nature Conservancy was founded in 1952. The Nature Conservancy is now in 79 countries around the world. We are making a big difference in conserving more than 120 million acres of lands around the world and 173 million acres of critical ocean habitat. In California, we have been on the scene for more than 60 years. Our work here encompasses the conservation of more than a million and a half acres directly in our work and 1.8 million acres of ocean habitat out there. And we are very fortunate today to welcome our California Board of Trustees, our California Leadership Council, our Conservation Professionals, and strategy leads. Many of whom have worked directly with Congressman Huffman over the years in his tenure in the legislature as well as now in the Congress. And this is an exciting moment for us. We have a lot moving forward. The reason we are calling this the determining decade is that we really have just 10 years to turn the trajectory of the planet and really begin to get on a much more sustainable track in managing natural resources and addressing the challenges of climate change both for people and for nature. We're going to begin with some introductions. My colleague Liz Borsberg will be handling a number of your questions. You will see a little bar down in the bottom right of your screen to formulate questions and send those on to Liz and we will be putting those in the queue. So do push that Q&A feature button and Liz will be able to do that in plugging all your questions in today as best we can. And I appreciate the energy of our guest and I will try to be as succinct as possible to get through as much as we can today because we really do have a full slate with Congressman Huffman who represents the second district in California. That district extends from Marin County through Mendocino, Del Norte, Humble, Trinity and Lake counties. I believe are also in there and we have been active on the ground in Congressman Huffman's district from his time in the legislature and began in 2006 through 2012 to his tenure in Congress which began in 2013 and he is just a fantastic member of Congress from the Nature Conservancy's perspective and we really kind of refer to him as the Congressman for Nature. He sits on the Senate or the House Natural Resources Committee, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the Select Committee on Climate Crisis and he also shares the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water Oceans and Wildlife and this committee has the best the best tag is the WOW committee from our perspective and getting things done and it has jurisdiction over federal water projects, fisheries management, coastal oceans policy and wildlife management and endangered species. So it is really really a pleasure to welcome Congressman Huffman to our determining decade town hall today. Congressman Huffman how are you doing all of this COVID adjustments out there? Well I'm hanging in there Jay and it's great to be with you and with members of the Nature Conservancy team. Thanks for being a keeper of the flame really for TNC and the good work that you do. This COVID crisis has really forced a lot of workarounds on all of us and so we're all adapting our work and our daily routines to this unusual situation but I'm hanging in there and just really trying to get my subcommittee and the Congress back on the field so we can continue our work. That's been a real challenge for these last couple of months and I'm really glad to see you doing the same thing for TNC and let me just take a moment to thank all of you for the many years of collaboration and good work. I've just really enjoyed working with you as partners for nature and when you describe my district you describe in an awful lot of good work the TNC has done and continues to do right now in Northern California so thanks for that. Yeah well I know this COVID crisis has also had a personal impact as well that I know that your mother-in-law was diagnosed with COVID-19 and how is she doing now? She's doing just fine she's in a nursing home in Texas and you know you've heard about how congregate living facilities are often hot beds so yeah she did get COVID-19 has recovered and a lot of people have it worse. Yeah yeah we've lost a friend at one of the pleasant hill facilities in the East Bay so it's yeah it's just one of those moments where every moment is precious and we have to recognize that in our moving forward. You talked a bit about some of our early work together one of the most exciting things we did sitting down was why can't we do these fisheries restoration projects a lot faster and let's just let's develop a new track for the Department of Fish and Wildlife and working together on that assembly bell 1961 some years ago to accelerate a stream bed permitting for restoration and can you talk a little bit about your passion for fisheries and this? Well I like to fish and I really love rivers and streams and those environments and so there's a personal connection to that work and I happen to represent some places that are just really spectacular resources so all kinds of reasons why I have enjoyed diving in and doing that work with you and yes we not only did some important streamlining for restoration work in northern California but we renamed the Department the the venerable department of fish and game and I still have some old timers that curse me for that but I think we did the right thing. Absolutely I think that it reflects the wider public trust resources the department has to manage in a state with 40 million people and I think that reality just in you know changing the brand has a big impact and you're right about that I think we've got a deeper consciousness for the full spectrum of work that the department does beyond just the the fishing and the game part of it so appreciate your leadership to get that moving. Turning to an issue that we've worked on pretty actively with you and your staff and again there's the water oceans of wildlife subcommittees probably the focal point for TNC's work in the Congress I mean we we almost I feel guilty sometimes we probably wear our welcome out in your office but you're in such a hub of critical activity across it really are full portfolio and as you know one of the areas that's been a challenge to build a broad consensus in is management of forests and I think you've been helpful at getting us to help other environmental groups and other folks to understand and need to actively manage nature and the forest to bring back and protect the natural wildlife habitat and reduce the risk of these mega fires can you talk about where you think we are in political consensus on the approach that we've been working on together on forests well I think we're definitely making some progress and if I could I'll come right back to that but you mentioned my subcommittee water oceans and wildlife I need to thank the Nature Conservancy for helping me create the water oceans and wildlife subcommittee because when the Democrats took the majority after the 2018 election there was an effort but mainly led by committee staff at natural resources to kind of parse allow some of these jurisdictions and to force me as one of the likely subcommittee chairs to choose between oceans and wildlife and not to combine them into this one you know really super subcommittee that has so much of what we care about in the environmental community we had a lobby for that and it was it was a bit of a fight but we prevailed and I put my foot down and I said I want water oceans and wildlife together and I think it's a great success that we've combined those jurisdictions and now we can do all of that good work in that way so thank you I know that you were part of that effort behind the scene to try to overcome the resistance to that but on forest management one of the reasons I do think we're making progress is that groups like TNC are out there doing this work on the ground with some unlikely coalition partners and demonstrating that you can have these working landscapes they can they can operate for multiple benefits including fire resiliency and improved watershed yield and all of these other things that we talk about and and I think that demystifies it a little bit we're always going to have some friends you know in the environmental community that don't ever want to cut trees and I appreciate the fact that you all have have worked in that space where you understand that working landscapes if they're done really right to high standards are really good for the environment and that that's the way we need to move our forest management and range land management and other working landscapes now as we scale this up we'll have some challenges too we'll be using more fire on the landscape which creates some smoke and nuisance claims there we'll probably end up also using herbicides to do some of this work and you know we're trying to carefully manage all of that but can you help us I mean how do we get that next step how do we make people feel confident a safe barge and how do we you know how do we bring this everybody together that this is the right this is the right path forward well it's not going to be easy and I think our best chance of doing that frankly is the credibility the science-based approach and the brand that TNC brings to these endeavors I think most environmentalists understand that you aren't in love with pesticides and herbicides but you know if you're suggesting we need to use them in very specific applications in very careful ways that goes a long way toward assuring people that this isn't a bad thing so you know I'm really grateful that you're in that coalition and that it's it's not you know some industry-led effort where we wouldn't have that comfort level with how the herbicides would be used I'm using that as an example but I think the TNC brand is a powerful part of making all of this succeed because you bring along a lot of folks who would otherwise be skeptics of some of these efforts within the environmental community yep well that's helpful thank you I do feel like your leadership also inspires water agencies to get more active in this space you know we've got this great partnership with the Placer County Water Agency we're making some headway with you the county water agency and hopefully to continue to move up those watersheds will you know yield more partners and bringing this to scale and and thinking about what are the other tools that help us prevent these horrific mega fires and just the reality that our forests aren't going to come back like they are now unless we really kind of undo a lot of the clear-cut practices that created sort of these even-age management challenges out there across the landscape so hey as we're on the context of thinking about scaling up and resources you've been working hard on thinking about environmental stimulus ideas as an element getting around the corner on COVID-19 how are you feeling about I know it's not the next bill but how are you feeling about our prospects for getting an environmental stimulus to invest in forest health and green infrastructure and some of the other critical areas that need support and funding well I think if we can get a genuine stimulus on the table and you know we've called some of the things we've done so far stimulus and I think we've misused that term what we've really been doing is triage all of the congressional responses so far have been about trying to staunch the bleeding of both the public health crisis on the front line for health care workers and hospitals and clinics and state and local governments that are bearing a lot of those costs watching their revenues go off a cliff so I think so far there's been very little stimulus and an awful lot of just lifelines for all of those needs but very soon I think we're going to have to change the conversation to how we revive basically an economy that's gone into a coma and that's where infrastructure comes in immediately and if we're going to be doing infrastructure and if we're going to make sure that we're doing it in a smart forward-looking way that's climate resilient and green we got to look at our natural infrastructure too so that's our opening I feel confident that we're going to be able to do some things certainly at a minimum some of the backlog on parks and public lands maintenance that's something Republicans have even expressed a willingness to support you've seen what the Senate has done on a big public land funding initiative that we could fold into that effort I hope we can go even further though and you know I'm selfishly looking at my Northwest California wilderness recreation and working forest act which I know that you have helped push along so far and we passed that out of the House of Representatives now you talked about the kind of creative forest management you know we're setting aside a special restoration area in the South Fork Trinity and the Mad River watershed that will provide about 600,000 acres that are exactly what you described places that were clear cut replanted in these plantation even age very unhealthy very fire susceptible manners and we need to restore those areas and they'll create jobs and they'll make us more fire resilient and we will improve coho salmon habitat and other environmental values along the way so we've got some opportunities I'm excited and it'll be between now and you know the end of the summer I think that'll determine whether we can make this happen yeah that's great well we're in a hundred percent so whatever we can do to help move this you know we we want to be an appended ship to provide a catalyst for this so we look forward to continuing to work with you and your staff and that I I'd like to turn also to kind of think about how we you know a lot of the success that you've had has been in a sense that pivot on one of the last great Republican environmentalists who represented your part of the world state senator Peter bear when environmental issues really were bipartisan and one of the things that you have said to me that's really resonated is you want to bring back Republicans to support these issues and can you just talk a little bit about your efforts in the fisheries caucus and then other forums to really grab a mantle of bipartisanship around environmental issues again well I am certainly trying to do that Jay and I appreciate the question and I know that TNC has a long history of just ignoring partisan politics and doing good work for nature and that that's really what it should be all about but that the difficult reality is that there aren't too many Peter bear Republicans left in fact there's almost none left and the Republican party itself has has essentially ostracized any Republicans that continue to think that way so they're not welcome within their own party the way they used to be and you know we've just become so tribal and so polarized but I think you never stop trying and so a couple of ways in which I've done that you mentioned marine fisheries I am determined to reauthorize the Magnuson Act which is the Keystone Federal Law for managing marine fisheries and you know this is an area that was never partisan historically it's always been strongly bipartisan and really non-partisan and yet in recent years like just about everything else it's gotten hijacked with all these other agendas to go after the antiquities actor to go after marine sanctuaries or the ESA and so efforts to reauthorize it have stalled because of those that infusion of politics into it so when I became chair of this subcommittee with jurisdiction over marine fisheries I wanted to try to reset the conversation and I thought a good way to do that is it's not just the the substance we put forward is the process and so I have undertaken this national listening tour where I go around to every region in the country that has a marine fisheries management council and I have these listening sessions I invite Republicans I invite people of all persuasions and so you've you've certainly got some provocative voices that come to the table but I want everyone to be heard and I want to bring science to the conversation and I I've invited Republican colleagues and some of them have shown up for these listening sessions and my my working assumption here is that that we can reset the conversation and take some of the politics out of it and I think it's working so when I get that draft bill and reintroduce it I think it's going to be really hard for my Republican colleagues who constantly want to fulmet this polarization to say that I'm playing politics or to say that I'm being partisan and so I think by sticking out that high ground we do our part to make it better I'm doing the same thing right now in response to the COVID-19 crisis I had a virtual hearing yesterday and I went out of my way to invite Republicans and and bear in mind my ranking member is one of the most bombastic partisans you will find in the universe Tom McLean talk and I went out of my way to reach out to Tom and to say I want you to join me in this we're going to pick a non-partisan subject how the pandemic is affecting fishing communities I'm going to give you full participation and help pick the panelists and participate like we would in an official hearing there's nothing partisan about this and a bunch of his members RSVP that they wanted to join me because you know they represent working waterfronts that are getting hammered so this was shaping up pretty good and then the Republican leadership put out a fatwa and said no you cannot cooperate with Democrats and you must stand down and not participate and no officiaries who had initially said they wanted to join us pulled out all the Republicans who at RSVP pulled out and Tom McLean talk wrote a fire breathing letter to me that said that if our if our founders back in 1789 had intended Congress to meet virtually using video technology they would have said so so that's where we are Jay it's not a it's not a happy report but I'm going to keep trying yeah well we thank you for this I think candidly as we've discussed in the past the fishermen really are ahead of the curve on this as you know our efforts have really been focused on data modernization focusing on certain parts of the industry and trying to expand adoption of data sharing real-time fisheries management on the water to stay away from sensitive over fish species and focus on those that aren't and so we really we appreciate your driving this to a modernization of the Magnuson Act if you will and really thinking about how we use better how we use technology more effectively on the water with fishermen buying into it and really driving their market and and and I think that that's the corner that we we really do need to get around yeah I was gonna open it up this point Liz is flagging me that we're getting quite a few questions in I do want to thank our Board of Trustees the Leadership Council our Nature Conservancy staff team that's providing again a lot of the intellectual work that we're trying to bring to the Water Rishings Wildlife Committee staff and Congressman Huffman and for those of you that haven't found it yet it's a question tab down in the lower right hand corner and with that Congressman let me turn it over to another familiar face for you my colleague Liz Forsberg to help manage some of the question flow we're getting in here thank you hi Liz. Hi good morning Congressman we have a couple of questions on climate change so I'll start with a broader one and then we'll get into a more specific question so the first one is California has been a leader in addressing the global challenges of climate change do you see the COVID-19 crisis having an effect on how people think about air pollution and climate change potentially you know I think all of these cross cutting impacts of the COVID-19 crisis I'm not sure whether this will settle out as something that really helps our climate efforts or something that sets us back because of what it's doing to the economy basically but there will be some opportunities and you know the fact that folks in Southern California can actually see mountains and snow and that we have clean air and you know we have some at least anecdotal and very interesting evidence of wildlife resilience those are positive things our fishing communities right now are you know largely staying in the ports because there's no demand for their product they can't sell through restaurants right now and so you know any any over fished or threatened fisheries are going to get a little bit of relief just by virtue of this economic downturn now that's not a great thing for for people and for the economy but maybe there's a way in which it it inspires people to do more to protect nature I think the one way in which it could be beneficial is that this pandemic really exposed how important science is and how we really just have to step up collectively and respond using science and actual facts if we're going to save ourselves from situations like this and I think the climate crisis lends itself to a really similar argument that I hope will will be apparent to people going forward Congressman can you talk a little bit about the work of the select committee on the climate crisis we didn't really touch on that and I know that's an important area of work for you sure yeah so the select committee chaired by Kathy Castor of Florida spent a year and a half holding all kinds of hearings and meetings and the culmination of our efforts according to our our charge from speaker Pelosi was to be a report that was supposed to be issued at the end of March now obviously the the pandemic hit just about everything in congress was shelved and so our report well it was substantially finished I mean I have a huge three-ring binder that is the draft report from the select committee it was held back and there's a couple reasons for that one is that doing anything not directly related to the pandemic right now politically strike some people as a little tone deaf so the timing needed to be reconsidered but the second is that I think we want to step back and rethink at least some of the framing if not you know many of the provisions in our report in the face of this pandemic and and so we're taking that opportunity to do that and I can't tell you exactly when the report will come out we're going to work closely with speaker Pelosi and figure out a time that makes sense but you know we're not we're not abandoning it by any measure we're just thinking trying to think strategically about when it comes out and I think you'll be pleased by a lot of what you see because you know as good as something like the Waxman Markey bill was a decade ago which was the high water mark for you know climate policy making in Congress it it was not an economy-wide look at the climate crisis in fact it wasn't really even looked at as a crisis at that time we are we're responding you talk about it this next decade is being so pivotal that's exactly how we're approaching it in the climate report and we're looking economy-wide at everything including natural systems so I think you'll be pleased certainly by the scope of what we put out there we won't presume to very prescriptively say how we're going to tackle every single issue for example there will be a recommendation that we embrace carbon pricing but we're not going to articulate exactly what kind of carbon pricing where that price should be set etc so just want to manage your expectations but I think you'll like a lot of what's in that report when we finally push it out well you've long been a champion for the role of conserving natural and working lands and EO Wilson gave us kind of a new target in his recently published book to conserve 50% of the lands that are out there and leave them untouched is that a topic that will be addressed in the report well probably not as ambitiously as EO Wilson puts it forward I love I love his work and I love the way he stretches our imagination and I think he's probably right you know spot on with the science and everything else we're going to talk about the need for biodiversity and for resiliency for wildlife and natural systems and also how they can be part of the climate solution but I doubt that you're going to see anything as as prescriptive as what EO Wilson challenges us to do plus he's he's looking globally and and we're looking primarily at the United States yeah well that's great we look forward to that report well let me turn this back to you I just got the way they're in climate building on the climate theme can you share your thoughts on HR 763 from the citizens climate lobby which include the fee on and dividend on oil extraction oil extraction yeah so this is one of several carbon pricing models that is being advanced out there and there is a bill that is bipartisan in the Congress that's a good thing to have any Republicans and a whole bunch of moderate Democrats and some progressive Democrats supporting this fee and dividend carbon pricing models the real elegant model it would be revenue neutral and kind of like the Alaska permanent fund for oil this would create a bit of a constituency for climate change by turning those carbon revenues right back to the American people so it's a really interesting and innovative idea here's why I'm not co-sponsoring the bill to be very candid it also calls for a freeze on EPA regulation under the Clean Air Act and I can't go there I cannot suspend any of our rulemaking tools as a price for doing carbon pricing and I think that reflects a continuing notion that some people bring to this issue that if you just do carbon pricing everything takes care of itself that it's sort of like the silver bullet and the more I look at this and look at what's been done historically in another countries that the less I am convinced that carbon pricing really is a silver bullet I think it's it's a bunch of buckshot really and carbon pricing has to work in tandem with standard setting and with in some cases just bands on things and with some policies that are command and control keep it in the ground restrictions on fossil fuel development I really don't want to give up any of those tools because my analysis convinces me that betting everything on carbon pricing is not what's going to get this done in the next 10 years in fact it takes a long time for markets to mature and to function properly and even when they do they often don't don't work so I'm not there for a market mechanism only response to climate change I am there for carbon pricing and conjunction with all these other tools and that's why I respectfully think that bill needs some more work. Got it thanks thanks for that. Liz what else do you have to get there? Some more questions on legislation the Great American Outdoors Act funds the land and water conservation fund as well as provides funding to address the maintenance backlog international parks. What do you think the prospects are for moving a companion bill through the house and what is the likely path forward could this be done in the context of economic stimulus? I short answer yes I think there's a great opportunity to do this and it's really strange to have some Republican senators and even President Trump you know extolling the land and water conservation fund and calling for its permanent funding we all know that Donald Trump doesn't even know what the LWCF is. One of his pollsters has definitely told him that Cory Gardner knows what it is and that his his political life may depend on delivering some of this stuff so yeah we've got a real opportunity and I think there is certainly a lot of desire in the house to to get that done. Yeah well I think it's important also a lot of these programs and we've just been doing some work with Bay Area Council to identify the link between these investments and jobs and future economic resiliency. I mean FEMA has already told us that addressing climate risk pays out a six to one dividend on communities to address flood risks, sea level rise, fire risk and so I hope that people are understanding that and I think you're I think you're getting folks to think more broadly in that realm so you know I guess we just have to keep filtering in here. Yeah you know our part of our challenge in the house will be Rob Bishop. He is no fan of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. You know that he has tried to hijack it and reinvent it and you know even take some of those royalties and put them back into a fossil fuel internship program and training program for the fossil fuel industry which is just a grotesque idea for the LWCF but what he gets out of this is you know sort of what he would like to see is his crowning achievement as he leaves Congress his own Parks Maintenance Backlog funding bill would be part of the mix presumably so we should be able to to thread that needle and get it done. Right. Curious are you hearing anything from the Interior Department about their plans or strategy for reopening national parks as we're thinking about are we reopening California? No although you know I sort of shudder to think about where they might take us and messages that are probably inherent in whatever they would try to do with Donald Trump looking on. I'm grateful that at least here in California and in my district our local park superintendents have been deferential to the state public health standards and to our local public health directors so you know I've got I'm national park rich in my district and they are shoulder to shoulder with our local public health directors in terms of you know how they're going to restrict access and then eventually how they're going to gradually reopen and do it in a way that's safe so we're in good hands at least here in California. Great. All right let's let me turn back to you here. Great so moving on to our oceans does your subcommittee also deal with plastics and micro-micro-pastics in the environment? Why can't we plan plastics and replace them by a better alternative? Gosh I would love to do that. That that sounds great. My subcommittee does have that jurisdiction and we are going to when we can get back on the field we are going to do some ocean plastics hearings. Senator Allen, sorry Congressman Allen Lowenthal has really been leading on this on the House Natural Resources Committee and he has a bill to address this but I think we've got to do a lot more you know maybe one of the ways in which this break from the fossil fuel industry that we know we have to have to do for climate purposes maybe one of the the co-benefits can be that plastics are you know sort of another arm of the fossil fuel economy and the less fossil fuels we use the less push for plastics everywhere you know I hope but we we should tackle plastics head on as well. Yeah so we were involved in an effort to qualify an initiative out here to reduce plastics waste across all categories by at least 25% by 2030 and additionally to put processes in place to drive toward renewable plastic products and overall waste production and I'm disappointed to report to you that when the COVID crisis hit our ability to get any signatures on the street for initiatives also went out the door and so we're hoping that if things open up a bit in the month of June that the plastics waste reduction initiative we're just a hundred thousand or so signatures short that we can get that qualified for the November 2022 ballot and I think Californians are really ready to embrace this challenge of moving toward a more renewable more waste conscious and approach to packaging materials so I think there is good news out there but it's maybe on hold for a bit. Liz? Great so keeping on the theme of oceans what are the biggest issues facing management of our ocean and fisheries resources? Well I think making sure that the pillars of the Magnusen Act which has been so successful in rebuilding you know badly depleted fisheries here in the United States and putting us on a path of science-based management and increasingly ecosystem-based management we're going to make sure that the the rigor of the Magnusen Act isn't undermined by folks who they want to err on the side of fishing when there's uncertainty and I think the science would have us err on the side of caution when there's uncertainty you're never going to have perfect science on exactly how many fish you have and exactly what's going on out there but you know those strict rebuilding timeframes those strict catch limits and encodas and the the rigor that has been part of the success the really key to the success in Magnusen they're under fire from a lot of folks who want to go back to the battle days of just fishing stuff to total depletion and then moving on to the next fishery so that's really our challenge I think climate change brings some opportunities because we've got fish stocks shifting all over the place and it has forced a lot of people to understand that we really need to address shifting stocks and other aspects of climate change and that's going to require a lot of science and research and you know that that science is also critical to these other management pieces so I think I think we can do it I really do and these these listening sessions have given me a lot of confidence that there's tremendous support for holding the rigor in the Magnusen act but we will be invited to create you know broad off ramps to science base management at every turn and and Don Young unfortunately has has kind of gone over to the dark side on some of these things so we're going to need to pull him back he used to be you know really good at supporting those key pillars of the Magnusen act and we've got some work to do there yeah we're really hopeful that we can get to your earlier point about getting to science base management and getting some matching federal investment out there to to really help capitalize fishermen to have online technology to really share data on daily catch basis more open lace and and transparently because as we've discussed before these records just sort of sit around in wildlife agencies in paper and metal file boxes and don't really add value and we can really use technology to do so much better here yeah technology really help us in the way you just mentioned Jay but also on the recreational side I mean in a number of places that there's been just a lot more recreational pressure on fisheries and you know growing popularity of recreational fishing greater ability of recreational fishers to just catch an awful lot of fish using the boats and the technology that they now have access to and and so we've got to figure out given that this is an increasing part of of what we're doing out there how do you manage that how do you even get data from recreational fishers it's a totally different situation than all of these commercial operators that you know have to follow all these strict reporting requirements and you know it's kind of easier to regulate them than it is that this this diffused and and unruly situation with with recreational folks but technology can be part of it smart phone apps and other types of reporting and figure out a way to get them into the mix they can help us keep better fish counts as well yeah that's great that's great let's uh what let me let me get you have a rally here all right next question what do you think of carbon offsets is the money currently being raised from offsets being used well or could it be used better well carbon offsets I think are definitely part of the toolbox and I I would never categorically disparage them at the same time if you rely entirely on offsets you're just going to have businesses usual continuing and a lot of places and people buying their way into never really changing anything this is one of the reasons why I think you know just setting a carbon price and counting on it to deliver us from the climate crisis doesn't work because what you'll simply see is you know a lot of fossil fuel entities just pass along a higher price and keep doing exactly what they're doing if you allow offsets in the form of carbon capture and sequestration which I think is a total myth I don't think it it even exists in a in a climate friendly way out there you're going to see similarly business as usual just continue and it's going to be harder to make that that break from fossil fuel that to me I have concluded the key to getting this done is a really hard break from fossil fuel and I think all of these elaborate mechanisms that sort of pretend that we can still have an economy built on fossil fuel we've just really got to confront that and reject it otherwise we're not going to get this done great so moving on to water water some of the biggest challenges in water management in California how can we help develop more resilient water infrastructure and finally do you think there is a prospect for an agreement on federal water legislation this year yeah good question we're going to we're going to try I've got a California water bill that will be introducing here in the days ahead it's a forward-looking bill that instead of inviting us to always fight the last water war over the delta or over a couple of big controversial dams that are unlikely to ever happen it looks at the kinds of things California water managers are doing on the ground and the kind that a whole bunch of them want to do water recycling and and dealing with some of these contaminated aquifers that can be remediated and brought back online through advanced treatment obviously cutting edge water use efficiency you know across all sectors there's so much more that we can be doing desalination I believe is part of the portfolio that has to be in our future because it's going to take pressure off hammered estuaries like the delta and like some of our northern California rivers so I fundamentally believe that our estuaries and our rivers have to stop being the backstop to water demand in the future in California and these other tools can do the job now the nice thing about them is they'll also be more reliable when you think about climate change going forward you don't want to be you know 2030 million southern Californians relying on this far flung water import scheme that is very vulnerable to disruption and to volatility with climate change far better to have your own resources you can manage locally through storm water capture and building up your aquifers and doing some smart desalination in places where it makes sense the kind of water recycling we're seeing in orange county and other places pushing the envelope of reuse that's the future and it makes sense for reliability it makes sense for climate resiliency and it makes sense for those of us that care about rivers and fisheries and natural systems that just have to stop being the backstop for the next increment of water in a growing state like California. I would be pretty remiss if I didn't talk about a potter valley here too I think I don't know that I should call it a depth for nature element of PG&E's bankruptcy but it's certainly and it's been operated as a hydro asset by PG&E I think that the nature conservancy and then north coast salmon partnership if identified this is a real opportunity to decommission that facility and really move forward and get around the corner you've been a champion of this effort can you talk a little bit about your vision of and maybe a timeline on how we actually make progress on potter valley here and keep other stakeholders on board. Yeah this is an exciting opportunity here Jane I'm really glad that TNC has gotten more and more engaged and is working as part of this coalition with CalTRAOD and Trout Unlimited and the Civic Coast Federation of Fishermen and several Native American tribes that see this opportunity to do something big for the eel river you know this was one of California's great salmon rivers and there've been all kinds of things that have hurt the eel river over the last 50 years or so but taking out this dam on the main stem will open up hundreds of miles of really prime spawning habitat and you know we'll work on those other impacts we've made a lot of progress on mitigating the impacts of forest management on restoring some impacts from legacy forest practices obviously the marijuana industry has hammered the eel river watershed but we're making progress addressing that as well so this one the fish passage piece on the main stem eel is big and the great thing about it is this dam has outlived its usefulness put in place a hundred years ago not for water supply but for hydropower to help regulate the flow to a downstream diversion at Van Arsdale you know it has provided that hydropower but came to be a major water supply project in the Russian river basin because that diversion over into the Russian basin kind of helps places like Potter Valley and the Ukaia Valley and the Alexander Valley thrive and become you know major agricultural hubs so a hundred years later we don't need that upstream dam anymore for hydro because PG&E wants out of this project but you've got a lot of folks in the Russian river basin that have come to depend on the water from that diversion now the good news is we've figured out that we can maintain a run of the river diversion to meet those needs in the Russian river basin and we can take out that major dam one of the tallest dams in California as a matter of fact and we can open up all that habitat but it's going to be expensive it's going to require building trust between these interest groups and between these two basins and probably doing things together you know we'll need to make investments for the water supply reliability on the Russian river side as we take steps to to to take that dam down but that coalition's holding together I've got water users in the Russian tribes and fishermen and environmentalists in the eel river basin and they are working together saying we want to go take out that dam and do this project and take over the the furclicens so so far so good it's exciting yeah yeah I think that's very exciting and appreciate your leadership in this a couple of your colleagues I guess this is this project actually borders four congressional districts is it's we've had a lot of interest in this and it's it's just it is I think one of those things that as you point out it's a it's a relic that has outlived its usefulness and we can do something inspiring and restoring the eel river salmon run to and so thank you for your continued shouldering into this and keeping the work moving forward on it so let me why don't we get a couple more questions in if we can and go forward yeah I think we have time for two more questions so here's a big question on what issues would you like TNC to lean in more on hmm well that's fun to think about um let's start with the one we just left off on with the the Pottery Valley project in the eel river restoration opportunity you're already there you know helping with the technical work and other things um we really need to develop the constituency for dam removal in Lake County that's where this dam uh the Scott dam and Lake Pillsbury are and it's one of the main points of opposition and resistance to this two basin solution because there are some folks who have leases on on property these these rentals basically on Forest Service land and they like their Lake Pillsbury recreation they're not a large group but they're really vocal and they've gotten the Lake County Board of Supervisors and Chamber Commerce and others in Lake County to believe that this is really a terrible thing for Lake County it's not it's actually a really good thing for Lake County um there's going to be a lot of jobs that go along with the dam removal and with the restoration work there's going to be a live free flowing river uh that continues to course through that area so anyone who's lucky enough to have a cabin lease or anything else is still going to be in a beautiful place with lots of recreation it's just going to be a little different but we need to um address the potential political backlash within Lake County and I think the naturopon servency it has the relationships and the credibility to really help with that uh that is uh one example and then help me stop oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge uh that is a here and now threat you it's just amazing with $20 a barrel barrel oil and uh with every major lender in the United States saying we won't finance drilling in the Arctic that the Trump administration is pressing ahead with a lease sale that will get pennies on the dollar it'll be some bottom feeder that comes along and uh you know snatches up property rights that will complicate our efforts to protect that place that that really amazing place uh going forward we'll have to buy them out in some future date and we need to just stop this we need to figure out a way to get the Trump administration to stand down and I would appreciate uh your efforts in that regard right right if you have one more you do so crisis is like COVID-19 can be catalyst for change how can we increase the odds that some positive change occurs as we rebuild our economy um thank you for that question I I need to spend more time thinking about positive change because frankly all of the carnage that I see from the Trump administration can be a little overwhelming and all of us uh you know are invited into the pit of despair uh these days whether it's the the malaise from the COVID-19 crisis or just the endless environmental assault that we see from the Trump administration so um the the best I can do is uh look to the way most of us have responded to this imperative of a public health crisis and saving lives and changing our behavior it's really been remarkable uh you know I I go out to when I need to go out to a store or to take a walk on the trail and I just see people stepping up and protecting themselves and others and honoring uh what the public health experts are telling them they need to do and um that's happening all over the country you know blue state red state for the most part vast majorities in the american people have stepped up and accepted the facts and are being part of this collective response um we've got to figure out a way to tap into that same thing because it's really quite hopeful I think and can be part of how we succeed uh in the face of the climate challenge Congressman Hoffman thank you so much for taking this time with uh the California trustees our leadership council uh our strategy teams are uh our folks doing the work on the ground and making things happen and uh you are in inspiration to us your your work and from the top of the upper watersheds to uh getting to science based flows and our rivers and all the way out to a more effective more balanced um more integrated more uh more involved management in our oceans uh really making uh fishermen full partners in that are just such critical ways to change natural resources management and we thank you for everything you're doing for your staff's accessibility your interest in new ideas um you know it's always it's always a pleasure to talk to you and thank you for taking this time today and just i'm hoping that you and Susan are doing well with your children at home i know that we're all juggling these things and you have school-aged children and uh you know going through all of this as well so uh take good care um we appreciate uh you're taking time today um and any last words of inspiration for us well just back at you on all of the the nice compliments Jay i really appreciate it and it has just been an honor to work closely with TNC for a long time i'm excited about the work we have to do together going forward and i just really thank you for uh for basically embracing excellence when it comes to environmental advocacy uh and fighting for nature um you are the best of the best and we couldn't do it without you so thank you well thank you thanks for all your work all the energy you bring to it every day uh and your spirit just it's it's uh you're like one of those fire fishermen the mentality it might not be a good day catching fish but it's always the best day you can possibly uh be having when you're out there on the water and uh maybe we can get back to those moments soon enough as well so uh thank you again for for taking this time with us and thanks the work you're doing thanks good and i want to thank our audience out there i want to thank all of the nature conservancy california trustees our leadership council our strategy teams our conservation professionals that provide the the inspiration to do this work every day in the field and we value your work we take this determining decade um as really our charter um we our our our overall charter of course is to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends but we don't have much time to get to sustainable resource management california we welcome these moments of dialogue with you and our determining decade series and we'll look forward to having deeper conversations with you across these issues uh across these challenging issues of climate change and how we make uh the planet more resilient for people in nature and thank you all for all the work that you do on behalf of the nature conservancy in california be safe be healthy out there and take good care and uh we appreciate your work with us every day thank you you
