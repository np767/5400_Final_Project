the majority leader today I want to touch on a topic that as I announced recently I'm going to continue to speak about in the coming weeks and months on the Senate floor and that's the right of free speech the fundamental right is one of our most cherished it forms the beating heart of our democracy it says to the core of our civic identity yet these days it seems to be coming under increasing threat all across our country the challenge it faces are different from what we've seen in the recent past but we want to confront these two if we are to preserve the right for future generations that's certainly what I intend to do and I know others share that commitment and I hope more colleagues will join in this effort as well our colleagues know this is a topic that I've devoted a large part of my career to throughout the Obama years I warned that our ability to freely engage in civic life and organized in defense of our beliefs was under coordinated assault from the administration that appeared determined to shut up anyone anyone who challenged these efforts to suppress speech were well documented they extended throughout the federal government and they were often aided by the Obama administration's allies here in Congress there were threats before then as well I know because I took up the fight against many of them sometimes it was a lonely battle often it was an unpopular one but in my view was necessary because whether the threats to free speech came from the IRS or the Obama administration's SEC they shared a similar goal to shut down or scare off the stage those who chose to think differently today however the threat to speech to free speech is evolving the speech suppression crowd made on longer control the levels the levels of federal power but it hasn't given up its commitment to silencing those with an opposing view yesterday in the Judiciary Committee chairman Grassley held a hearing to explore the worsening problem of a lack of tolerance on college campuses imagine that college campuses of all places for the views of others lack of tolerance and college campuses for the views of others one of the witnesses at the hearing was Floyd Abrams our former colleague Senator Moynihan rightly described as the most significant First Amendment lawyer of our age mr. Abrams noted that we're witnessing an extraordinarily perilous moment with respect to free speech on campuses where too many students seem to want to see and hear only views they already hold and to prevent others from hearing views and with which they differ so what could account for this a profound lack of information is one answer for example whatever incites a study where quote nearly a third of college students could not even identify the First Amendment as the one that deals with freedom of speech the day before across the street the Supreme Court reminded us of the importance of a vibrant right of free speech where its exercise does not depend upon the sufferance of the government in striking down the disparagement clause of federal trademark law the court reminded us of what too many of those on college campuses appear not to have learned and to many others seem to have forgotten speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend the foundation for individual rights and education estimates there were 43 reported instances of revoked speaking invitations or similar efforts to block speakers on campus just last year that's double the number recorded the previous year it's more than 700 percent higher than the six students recorded back in 2000 and the trend is getting worse not simply in terms of the overall number of incidents but more worryingly in terms of the growing aggressiveness of those efforts this year alone there have been multiple multiple instances of intimidation violence and rioting at universities across the country there's been nasty and thuggish behavior aimed at suppressing speech sadly it is often succeeded as USA Today put it in a recent editorial in just the place where the clash of ideas is most valuable students are shutting themselves off two points of view they don't agree with at the moment when young minds are supposed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of arguments they're answering challenges to their beliefs with anger with violence instead of facts and reason that you're worried all of us regardless of party regardless of ideology hearing criticism of one's beliefs and learning the benefits of others learning the beliefs of others is simply training for life in a democratic society it doesn't mean one has to agree with those opinions but no one is served by trapping oneself and others in cocoons of ignorance that's hardly the recipe for free and informed society to quote Frederick Douglass to suppress free speech is a double wrong because it violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker just as it was not right during the Obama years for Americans to endure harassment or incur crippling expenses because the government didn't like what they believed it certainly is not right today for Americans to live in the shadow of fear simply because they dare to speak up or think differently or support a candidate or a cause that the speech suppression crowd may disagree with it really doesn't matter who you are or whether what you're saying is popular these rights do not exist to protect what's popular they exist precisely to protect what isn't that's one reason I've long opposed ideas like the flag-burning constitutional amendment doesn't mean I agree that the flag should be burned of course I don't disagree strongly but it's the principle that matters because the moment we allow ourselves to believe that some people stand outside the free speech protections of the First Amendment then we're all in trouble all of us the growing trend of intolerance we're seeing has taken many forms lately but the underlying hostility to free speech has not changed as I noted earlier in recent years the threat had often come from the federal government these days the threat tends to come from different quarters there have been many high profile incidences of speech suppression and violence at universities across the country in particular but it would be a mistake to think that this problem is isolated to college campuses the bottom line for me is this we simply cannot allow this trend of violence and intimidation to become the new normal in our country this is a really serious problem it deserves serious attention solutions will not come simply they will not be found in a single piece of legislation as President Reagan famously put it freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didn't pass it on to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on to them to do the same and that mr. president is what we're called upon to do again now to inform to engage to empower in the end to inspire a new generation to defend a fundamental right for future generations just as past generations did for us that's what I aim to do by continuing this dialogue here on the Senate floor from this platform I'll continue to raise the importance of free speech outline the threats it faces and do what I can to inform and encourage Americans to rally in its defence others are using their platforms to advance similar goals as chairman Grassley did yesterday I hope more will join as this discussion continues because free speech is crucial to who we are as Americans regardless of party and we owe it to few to future generations to do what we can today to defend
