U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) released the following statement today regarding the passing of retired judge Walt Maguire:
“I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my good friend, Walt Maguire. Walt and I attended law school together at the University of Kentucky, and his impressive judicial career spanning 29 years is a testament to his public service. His devotion to others was evident by his extensive involvement in the community—teaching classes at UK and Somerset Community College, as well as serving on several state judicial councils. Walt’s friendship meant a lot to me, and I always enjoyed seeing him when I was in Somerset. Elaine and I are thinking of his family and friends during this difficult time.”
