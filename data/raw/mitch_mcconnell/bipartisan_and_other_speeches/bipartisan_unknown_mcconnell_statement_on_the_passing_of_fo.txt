U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) released the following statement today regarding the passing of former Warren County Sheriff Jerry “Peanuts” Gaines:
“I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Warren County Sheriff Jerry 'Peanuts' Gaines. Sheriff Gaines devoted nearly four decades to serving the public—making him the longest serving sheriff in Kentucky history. An accomplished leader, Sheriff Gaines served as President of the National Sheriffs’ Association and President of the Kentucky Sheriffs’ Association. His work in founding the Kentucky Sheriffs’ Boys & Girls Ranch leaves an enduring legacy that should be celebrated. The impact Sheriff Gaines made on his community touched the lives of many, and I am grateful for his lifetime of service and dedication. Elaine and I are thinking of his family during this difficult time.”
