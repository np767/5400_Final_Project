“For nearly 30 years, Bobbie’s effective leadership made local government accessible, reliable, and responsible for all Jefferson County residents. Bobbie’s drive for excellence touched everything she did, and we all greatly benefited from her nationally-recognized service. Time and again, Bobbie earned the trust of her constituents, and she upheld the integrity and dignity of her office each and every day. The qualities that made her an exceptional public servant also made her a remarkable friend.
