WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) released the following statement regarding the announcement by State Senator Jimmy Higdon to not seek reelection:
“Jimmy Higdon is a legislative titan of the Kentucky General Assembly. His devotion to making the Commonwealth a better place through his work on transportation and infrastructure issues leaves behind an enduring legacy for generations to come. I am proud to have worked together with Jimmy on several important transportation projects like the Brent Spence Bridge, the Mountain Parkway in Eastern Kentucky, and the I-69 bridge in Henderson, Kentucky. While I am sad Jimmy is retiring, I’m confident he will continue to have a deep impact for the remainder of his term. I’m grateful for his more than 20 years of service to Kentucky, and for his several decades of friendship. Elaine and I wish him, Jane, and his entire family well in the next chapter of their lives.”
