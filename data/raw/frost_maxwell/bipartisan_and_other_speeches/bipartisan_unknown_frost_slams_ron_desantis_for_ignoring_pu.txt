Frost Slams Ron DeSantis for Ignoring Public Health and Announcing Plans to End Vaccine Mandates in the State
FL’s Surgeon General, a Known COVID Truther and Peddler of Anti-Vax Conspiracies, Will Oversee the Undoing of Floridians’ Health
WASHINGTON, D.C.
— Today,
Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost (FL-10)
released a statement following a press conference hosted by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, where he and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo made the reckless announcement that the state will be the first to end all vaccine mandates that curb the spread of infectious diseases.
Rep. Frost issued the following statement:
“Ron DeSantis and his fraud of a surgeon general want Floridians to die of diseases that have been widely eradicated for decades, all to score points with conspiracy theorists like RFK Jr.
“The decision to eliminate the state’s vaccine mandate is not based in truth or science but on unhinged, unproven conspiracy theories about medicines that have literally saved millions of lives.
“This will not only jeopardize individuals, but it will endanger entire communities. Florida will become a hotbed for diseases like measles, tuberculosis, RSV, and the flu – diseases that vaccines have proven to prevent and that threaten children, seniors, and vulnerable Floridians the most. In our schools, workplaces, and public spaces, no one will be safe. People will die. Kids will die.
“This is a disgusting move to undermine the health of Floridians. We need to do everything in our power to make sure this reversal never sees the light of day.”
