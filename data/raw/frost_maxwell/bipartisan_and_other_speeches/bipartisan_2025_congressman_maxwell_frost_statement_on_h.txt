Congressman Maxwell Frost Statement on House Passage of Stopgap Funding Bill
WASHINGTON, D.C.
— Today, Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost (FL-10) released a statement following House passage of a stopgap funding bill to temporarily keep the government funded through the end of January and reopen the government.
In a statement, Rep. Frost says:
“In this funding bill Congressional Republicans and the White House are cruelly choosing to let health care premiums soar for 20 million working Americans families. It’s a choice they’ve made clear that they are comfortable with.
“Republican inaction tonight on health care subsidies for working people will force more families to make the tough decision to go without any coverage at all.
“While Republicans have spent the last 43 days on a paid vacation, I’ve been hearing from constituents who will pay the price for their inaction: a woman battling breast cancer who won’t be able to afford her medication, a family of four now relying on food banks to put meals on the table in order to afford health care, a veteran currently in school one surprise medical bill away from being unable to pay their rent.
“Americans deserve better. And I will do everything I can to fight back against the Republicans trying to strip away health coverage from hard working Americans. Health care should not be a privilege only for those who can afford it, it’s a basic necessity in order to thrive, and it should be treated as a human right.”
