Congressman Maxwell Frost Statement on House Passage of Stopgap Funding Bill
WASHINGTON, D.C.
— Today, Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost (FL-10) released a statement following House passage of a stopgap funding bill to temporarily keep the government funded through November 21 and potentially avoid a government shutdown.
In a statement, Rep. Frost says:
“Healthcare costs are crushing working families and forcing them to make an impossible choice between food, rent, groceries, and medicine. In the richest country in the world, no one should have to live like that.
“Instead of working to ease that burden, House Republicans are making it worse. In July, they passed Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill for billionaires and mega corporations that strips 15 million people of their healthcare, cuts over half a trillion dollars from Medicare, and pushes hospitals to close. And today, House Republicans have doubled down on their recklessness by passing a temporary spending bill that ignores the expiring ACA tax credits that have helped working families afford their health insurance premiums. And when premiums go up, everyone pays the price.
“Time and time again, House Republicans have shown where their loyalties lie: not with working families or the people they serve, but with billionaires, corporations, and Donald Trump. Families deserve better.
“Republicans control the House, Senate, and Presidency. If the government shuts down, Republicans own it.
“Every single person deserves quality, affordable healthcare. House Democrats and I are going to fight like hell to make sure families get the care they need and deserve.”
