Frost Statement on Federal Judge Ruling Halting Operations at Horrific Everglades Immigration Detention Center
ORLANDO, FL
— Today,
Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost
(FL-10) released a statement following a federal judge’s decision ordering the State of Florida and the Trump Administration to halt construction and wind down operations at the Everglades Immigrant Detention Center, also known as “Alligator Alcatraz.”
In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams cited the extensive environmental damage caused to the Florida Everglades as a result of the detention center. Under the order, the facility must stop receiving new detainees immediately and fully cease operations within 60 days.
Rep. Frost issued the following statement:
“The Everglades Immigrant Detention Center is nothing more than a state-sponsored, government-funded internment camp designed to keep Black and Brown immigrants in hellish conditions while Donald Trump pretends it makes our country safer. Thanks to the tireless work of Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, this inhumane facility has been ordered to halt operations. This is a major victory for justice, civil rights, and our environment.
“But our fight doesn’t end here. I remain committed to holding this Administration accountable, and I will continue to show up unannounced to this and any other facility like it in Florida and across the country to protect innocent immigrants who are being racially targeted. This ruling is a step forward, but the struggle for justice continues. I won’t stop fighting.”
