Congressman Maxwell Frost Statement on the Passing of the Honorable Mable Butler
ORLANDO, FL
— Today, Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost (FL-10) released a statement following the death of former commissioner and councilwoman, Mable Butler.
In a statement, Rep. Frost says:
"I am deeply saddened by the news of the Honorable Mable Butler’s passing. This is a profound loss for our Central Florida community.
“The honorable Mable Butler made history for Central Florida as the first African American woman to serve on Orlando City’s Council and afterwards as the first African American member of the Orange County commission. She led with love, courage, and grit—always championing the people of Central Florida, especially our Black and Brown communities that are too often left behind.
“Even after retiring from public office after 20-plus years of service, she remained a force to be reckoned with in our community and a voice for progress. And I would not be serving in Congress today if it weren’t for leaders like her who blazed the trail for me. She leaves behind a legacy, not just as the matriarch of African American politics, but one that will continue to make Central Florida a better place for all and inspire the next generation of future leaders.
"May Mable Butler rest in power. Her love for Central Florida and her fearless advocacy will live on in all of us.”
