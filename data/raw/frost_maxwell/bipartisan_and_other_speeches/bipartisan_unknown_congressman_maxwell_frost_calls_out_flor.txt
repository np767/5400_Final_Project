Congressman Maxwell Frost Calls Out Florida GOP’s Effort to Cheat Voters with Partisan Redistricting
ORLANDO, FL
— Today,
Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost (FL-10)
issued a statement slamming the Florida House Speaker for
convening a Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting
to redraw and gerrymander Florida’s congressional map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The move comes as a wave of Republican-controlled states – led by Texas and Governor Greg Abbott – rush to suppress Democratic voters in a desperate attempt to cling to their majority in the House of Representatives.
In a statement, Rep. Frost says:
“Trump and Congressional Republicans know they’re on track to lose the House in 2026. They just voted to strip food and health care from working families to bankroll tax cuts for their billionaire donors – and they know they can’t defend that at the ballot box.
“But instead of facing the consequences of their shameful policies, Florida is now the latest state where Republicans are admitting they can’t win without cheating. From voter suppression to gerrymandering, Republican leaders have spent years trying to rig our democracy in their favor and now they want to draw maps that make sure to keep them in power. We will be coordinating closely with House and Senate Democrats in Tallahassee to fight this power grab.
“While GOP-led states take their orders from Trump, every Democratic-led state needs to follow California’s lead and redraw their own maps. At the federal level, we need to act now to end partisan gerrymandering once and for all. If Republicans refuse to work in good faith to protect democracy, Democrats cannot hesitate to fight back and use every tool at our disposal.”
