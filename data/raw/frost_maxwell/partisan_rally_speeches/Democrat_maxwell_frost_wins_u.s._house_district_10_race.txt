 Oh How's everybody doing How's everybody doing Central Florida my name is Maxwell a hundred of frost and I'm gonna be the first generation member of the United States Right now We made this three You know I got involved with spite 10 years ago because of the Sandy book studio when I was 15 years old A few weeks ago I was on social media and somebody actually conjured to one of my posts and they were mocking me They said this kid is a liar. He says that he became a warden eyes when he was 15 I see we have a lot of young people around here And I just want to know raise your hand if you start a organizing for a better world before you turn 18 years old The reason I bring this up is for a simple fact I started organizing at 15 because I didn't want to get shot in my school And the fact of the matter is there are so many people in this world so many families of a lost loved ones like man Who don't get that privilege And the fact the matter is we lose a hundred people in the gun violence The housing housing prices is out of control and people are yearning for bold champions who believe in the bold Transformational change that we need that every single person in central Florida across this whole state and across this nation Deserved by virtue of being a human You know I've had a lot of ups and downs over the past 10 years I know a lot of times it can feel like things are impossible or there's no Like I mean I've worked in gun violence for 10 years I thought that there's no like the other time for a while I've worked on many campaigns when I can't It lost but like there was no like the other time I remember sleeping in jail cell here in Orlando I feel like they're feeling like there was no like a The end of the tunnel because I was arrested for protest and when I look back at all those moments I always try to grab myself in the work that people have done that have come before me and someone that I always think about is a mother a mother who a long time ago in the 1950s lost her son because of racism Because of bigotry because of hate her name is making so her son emmit because he was black Was bludgeon being in and shopping ahead at 14 years old? And she wanted to do an open-casted ceremony so the public could see And what people came up to her when the press came up to her they said maybe maybe why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? She said I want the whole world to see what they said. What's next? She said I don't have a second to aim. I will pursue justice for the rest of my life And if she can say that in that moment we no matter where we're at no matter how things might seem if we don't see the life We must pursue justice for the rest of our life We must not give up We must not give up on the future that we believe because I'm here and people watching at the moment I want social floated to know that a better world is possible A better world is possible and we all deserve it because we are here right now You know we're against the movement right now that is using a false sense of patriotism and freedom to confuse people and divide us And this is about democratic versus Republican, left versus right This is about the people versus the problem, say that, the people versus the problem That's what this is about Because if you really want freedom you believe in the freedom to make decisions about your own body If you believe in patriotism, patriotism is about love in your country But it's more than that it's about loving the people in your country No matter who they love, no matter where they came from That's true patriotism See true freedom, true freedom is when you say no matter who you are you deserve to be healthy No matter what job you have, no matter where you come from That's true freedom And I want the people in this district to know that I love you I love you And I've said this comment time and again when you love somebody you want them to have these things Because you want them to be able to live their life That's for a business because when people start their small businesses That's for life and ours because you want people to be able to pursue the things that they want to do in life But you can't do that if you don't have the money to pay for your basic necessities That means a friable wage That means ensuring everybody has health care That means ensuring freedom from gun violence you can go to church and school And we're everyone in that world without being fucked up I love you too And at the end of the day it's about loving the oppressed more than you hate the oppressor And that's the message for tonight That is the message for tonight Love above all else No matter what And if you don't have a campaign you know this It's because it's about the fight for everything Every day Every day Every day That is what this is about So whether you're a Democrat Republican left or right in the people versus the problem Know that your Congressman loves you And will fight day in and day out Even if you're dead and hopefully even if you disagree with me Because this is more than just red or blue This is about humanity This is about my success being your success Your success being my success I'm honored to be the Congressman of Life for Florida's District Court of Guest for the President And I love you So let's get to work, thank you so much! I'm honored to be the President
