NEWS: Sanders: Mr. President, the Ball is in Your Court
November 7, 2025
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 – On the 38th day of the government shutdown and as congressional Republicans refuse to come to the negotiating table, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement:
The American people understand that the Republicans control the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives. And, as a result, poll after poll shows that they correctly hold the Republicans accountable for the shutdown.
But it’s not just polls. Tuesday’s elections, from Maine to California, showed growing opposition to Trumpism and his efforts to decimate the already-broken American health care system.
Very few Americans believe that it makes sense to give $1 trillion in tax breaks to the 1%, while throwing 15 million off of Medicaid and doubling premiums for more than 20 million.
Trump claims to be a dealmaker. Well, let’s make a deal. Let’s protect health care for tens of millions of Americans and end this shutdown immediately.
Mr. President: The ball is in your court.
