Washington, D.C.
— U.S. Senator Ted Budd (R-N.C.) and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) introduced the bipartisan
China Military Powers Transparency Act
to extend and update the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Annual Report on Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China (“China Military Power Report”) to monitor China’s military strength and strategic influence. Under this legislation, the requirement to submit the report to Congress would be extended from 2027 to 2030 and expand the required analysis.
“The People’s Republic of China has proven time and time again that its communist government cannot be trusted. As China continues to expand its influence abroad, the national security of the homeland must remain a top priority to counter its strategic influence. I am glad to join Senator Cortez Masto to introduce legislation that will ensure the U.S. monitors potential threats by closely tracking and assessing China’s military posture,”
said Senator Budd.
“In this critical moment, the United States must stay informed on Communist China’s potential future capabilities – military and otherwise,”
said Senator Cortez Masto.
“By expanding this report to include the CCP’s potential expansion into new and emerging technologies like cyber and biotech, we are making sure that we are ready for whatever comes next.”
