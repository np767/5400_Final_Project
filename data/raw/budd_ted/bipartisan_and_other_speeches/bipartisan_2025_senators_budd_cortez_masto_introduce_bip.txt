Washington, D.C.
— U.S. Senators Ted Budd (R-N.C.) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) introduced the bipartisan
Cybersecurity in Agriculture Act
today to enhance the cyberattack readiness, response, and recovery of American agricultural infrastructure. The legislation would prioritize cybersecurity preparedness by establishing a network of five Regional Agriculture Cybersecurity Centers to strengthen national security measures and protect the United States’ food supply.
“America’s adversaries are seeking to exploit agricultural technologies and jeopardize our national security. As North Carolina’s top industry, I have seen the benefits that precision technology has on increasing agricultural output and boosting exports, but i
t takes just one bad actor to stop our producers from feeding America. I teamed up with Senator Cortez Masto to mitigate cyber vulnerabilities by developing defense technologies and training our workforce to eliminate threats targeting American agriculture
,”
said Senator Budd.
“Innovative farmers and ranchers in Nevada and across the country should be able to use new technology without fear of being targeted by a bad actor,”
said Senator Cortez Masto.
“This bipartisan legislation will defend our agricultural sector from cyberattacks, promoting American national security and food security.”
“Agriculture and food systems are critical to the well-being of families, communities, and the nation,”
said North Carolina A&T Chancellor James R. Martin II.
“Having centers of excellence that focus on cybersecurity and agriculture would be a tremendous addition to the research, development, and collaborative efforts in which our land-grant university is already involved to protect the U.S. agricultural industry and advance American interests.”
