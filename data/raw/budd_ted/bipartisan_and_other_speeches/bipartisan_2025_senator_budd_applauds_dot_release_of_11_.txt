Washington, D.C.
— U.S. Senator Ted Budd (R-N.C.) today applauded Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy and Federal Highway Administrator Sean McMaster’s announcement of over $1.1 billion in federal relief grants to fund natural disaster recovery projects in North Carolina following Hurricane Helene and other storms dating back to 2020. These funds will support projects to repair roads, bridges, and drainage structures that have suffered significant damage due to flash flooding, landslides, heavy rainfall, tornadoes, rockfall, washouts, pipe blowouts, bridge collapses, and downed trees.
“I am grateful to Secretary Duffy and Administrator McMaster for their leadership in getting needed federal aid out the door and back to the state of North Carolina as we work to repair our damaged infrastructure as a result of Hurricane Helene and other severe storms from the past several years. President Trump’s Department of Transportation is following through on its promises and unlocking vital emergency relief to the Old North State, including aid that has been tied up dating back to the Biden administration,”
said Senator Budd.
