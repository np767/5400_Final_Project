Washington, D.C.
— Senator Ted Budd (R-NC) has joined a letter to major shipping companies regarding their policies discriminating against legal firearms and ammunition.
Recently, several large freight and shipping companies have implemented policies that discriminate against the firearm and ammunition industries, including prohibitions on shipments containing certain firearm parts to total bans on firearms and ammunition.
The letter was led by Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID) and co-signed by a total of 14 Senators.
Letter excerpts:
“[DHL/XPO Logistics/Saia’s] policy is an affront to the Second Amendment and discriminates against the millions of law-abiding citizens, including many of our constituents, who utilize and value their constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Your policy also discriminates against businesses engaged in the lawful commerce in firearms, ammunition and related products, including federal firearm licensees, who utilize your services to ship their products.”
“When . . . freight carriers engage in policy making from the boardroom and implement discriminatory practices, they are interfering in the lawful commerce of firearms, limiting distribution and market access, resulting in fewer options and higher costs for businesses and consumers. But even more importantly, they are infringing on the constitutional right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms enshrined in the Second Amendment.”
