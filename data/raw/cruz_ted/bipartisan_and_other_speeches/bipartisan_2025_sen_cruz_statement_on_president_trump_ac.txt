Sen. Cruz Statement on President Trump Action Against Nigeria for Christian Persecution
WASHINGTON, D.C. –
Today, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released the following statement after President Donald Trump’s announcement to designate Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern.
Sen. Cruz said,
“I am deeply gratified to President Trump for making this determination. I have fought for years to counter the slaughter and persecution of Christians in Nigeria, and this year introduced legislation that will lock in the designation made today. Today’s designation is a critical step in holding accountable and changing the behavior of Nigerian officials who have facilitated and created an environment conducive to the outrages in Nigeria. My legislation implements additional steps, including targeting those who implement blasphemy and sharia laws in Nigeria, and I am committed to working with the administration and my colleagues to advance my bill and implement these necessary measures. Today’s decision by President Trump is a great one, and I thank him for his strong leadership.”
