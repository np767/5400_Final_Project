Takano Signs onto Bipartisan Epstein Bill
WASHINGTON, D.C.
—
Rep. Mark Takano
signed onto H.Res.581, bipartisan legislation that would ensure the American public can know the truth about convicted child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
“I cosponsored this bipartisan legislation because the American people deserve the truth. Jeffrey Epstein committed horrific crimes andfor years, powerful people helped him, enabled him, or looked the other way. The public deserves to know who was involved.
But instead of helping us shine a light, House Republicans are doing everything they can to keep the truth hidden. They are shutting down the House to avoid a vote on this bill. They promised transparency. What they are delivering is a cover-up.”
