Takano Slams House GOP’s Huge Cuts to Basic Needs Programs to Fund Tax Break for Billionaires
WASHINGTON, D.C. -
Representative Mark Takano released the following statement after the House passed a budget bill which would cut people's basic needs while funding a tax break for billionaires:
"In dead of night, Republicans rammed through a budget bill that will strip health insurance from nearly 14 million Americans, put 11 million people on food assistance at risk of hunger, and increase the deficit by $2.3 trillion. Why make all these heartless cuts? To fund a tax break for billionaires. The independent data crunchers at the Congressional Budget Office found that the richest 10% of Americans will see their incomes go
up
, while the poorest 10% will see theirs go
down
.
"The truth is that this is not some routine budget bill. This is a reverse Robin Hood: stealing from the poor to give to the rich. It will go down as one of the most shameful bills the so-called ‘Grand Old Party’ has ever passed."
