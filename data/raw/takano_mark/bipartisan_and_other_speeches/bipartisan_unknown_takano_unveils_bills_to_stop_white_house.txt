Takano Unveils Bills to Stop White House Ballroom Renovations During Shutdown, Curtail Private Donor Naming Rights
WASHINGTON, D.C. —
Today,
Rep. Mark Takano (CA-39)
introduced two bills to rein in Donald Trump’s construction of the White House Ballroom during a government shutdown and bring oversight to recognizing of private donors on White House property.
White House Building Activities Locked-out in Lapse (BALL) Act:
prohibit use of federal funds for construction or renovation during the course of a shutdown except when related to health and safety.
White House National Official Trust: Forbidding Official Recognition, Sponsorships, Ads, Logos, and Endorsements (NOT FOR SALE) Act:
prohibit the permanent or semipermanent display or engraving of names of individuals or corporations on WH grounds without approval from the Speaker, Minority Leader, and White House Curator.
“While Americans across the nation are going without pay because Republicans have chosen to shut down the government instead of fixing their healthcare crisis, President Trump is full steam ahead on the construction of his $200 million-dollar White House ballroom funded by big corporate donors,”
said Rep. Takano
. “I will not stand by while we put the name of the highest bidder on one of the most iconic symbols of the United States. The White House belongs to the people, and the solemn honor of having your name has been reserved for historic public servants – not to billion-dollar donors.”
