Rep. Takano Denounces Cancelation of Minority Serving Institution Grants
WASHINGTON, D.C. —
Today,
Rep. Mark Takano (CA-39)
released the following statement after the Department of Education moved to cancel over $350 million in discretionary funds intended to support Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). MSI designations offer targeted federal funding to support underrepresented student populations pursuing higher education.
“UC Riverside was the first school in the UC system to be recognized as a Hispanic Serving Institution; and in 2018, UCR was recognized as an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution. These grants have allowed those schools to expand their recruitment, retention, mentorship, and opportunities for students underrepresented in higher education. This money has opened doors for thousands of students over the years and bettered life for everyone on campus, not just a select few.
“Secretary Linda McMahon and the Trump Administration are systemically hacking away at the pathways to a college degree on this country. Secretary McMahon is in the process of taking opportunities out of students’ hands to score points with the President, with no regard to the immediate or long-term impacts this will have on Americans’ economic opportunity or social mobility.
“At a moment when young Americans feel that the American dream is out of reach, this action only adds to feeling that the deck is stacked against them.”
