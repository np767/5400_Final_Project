Statement on the Passing of Representative Gerry Connolly
WASHINGTON, D.C.
-- Congressman Mark Takano released the following statement on the passing of Rep. Gerry Connolly:
"My heart breaks for Gerry’s friends and family.
"While he was a passionate advocate for his Virginia constituency, his childhood Massachusetts accent would shine through on the House floor as he exclaimed, “Mister Speaker.” I would always tease him for it.
"A witty, pugnacious, and principled fighter for our democracy and good government—we lost someone which great intelligence and deep experience. He will be missed."
