Library of Congress Erases Parts of Constitution from Website, Rep. Takano Demands Answers
WASHINGTON, D.C.
—
Rep. Mark Takano (CA-39)
sent a letter to Acting Librarian of Congress, Robert Newlen, demanding answers on the deletion of portions of the Constitution from an official government site run by the Library of Congress. Sections from Article 1 of the Constitution, including sections that implement the powers of Congress, provide checks against the President, Congressional oversight of DC, and govern the military were removed.
“Seeing the Library of Congress erase whole sections of the Constitution was deeply alarming,”
said Rep. Takano.
“Trump and his allies have mused about suspending Habeas Corpus, which made the deletion of this, and other articles in the Constitution even more distressing. The public deserves answers on how this happened, and I intend to get them.”
