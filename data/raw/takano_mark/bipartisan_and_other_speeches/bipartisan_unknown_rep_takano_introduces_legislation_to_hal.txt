Rep. Takano Introduces Legislation to Halt Funding to El Salvador Mega-Prison
WASHINGTON, D.C. –
Today,
Rep. Mark Takano (CA-39)
introduced a bill to halt and prohibit both current and future funding to the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) maximum security prison. This comes after reports that the White House initiated a $6 million payment to the notorious prison to detain immigrants deported to El Salvador.
Credible reporting has revealed CECOT engages in
human rights abuses
to include beatings, electric shocks, and cruel living conditions. This bill would make perilously clear that CECOT should receive no financial support from the U.S. government in order to facilitate torture.
“The United States should not be in the business of funding torture. CECOT is a mega-prison with a well-documented record of human rights abuses—electric shocks, beatings, and degrading conditions,”
said Representative Mark Takano
. “Yet the Trump Admin made a deal to send millions of taxpayer dollars to fund it. That is unacceptable. At a time when Republicans are trying to cut billions of dollars foreign assistance in the rescissions package, we cannot allow our tax dollars to bankroll a foreign facility that violates the very values we claim to stand for.”
