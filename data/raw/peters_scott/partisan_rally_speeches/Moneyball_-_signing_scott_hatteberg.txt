 race We need the planning for the big event tonight. But it was well worth it. The weather was ideal, and you can see people are still having great time out here. I'm happy to be here after a while. We're in a nice weekend for the tonight of all the big event. We're taking place down the street. Hello? Scott. Yes? It's Billy Bean of the Oakland days. Yes? Can we talk? Yeah. You want to let us in? Appart me? We're out front. What? On the curb. Oh, yeah, yeah. Howdy. Well, well, thank you. Thank you, Mal. Very kind. How's your boss, Scott? You know what's good? It's really good. It's great. I can't throw the ball. Yeah. You throw a new last ball from behind home plate. That's what I'd say. Good news is, we want you at first. We want you to play first space for the Oakland days. OK, well, I've only ever played catcher. Scott. You're not a catcher anymore. If you were, our call wouldn't have been the only one you got when you're contracting, Spire. Yeah, hey, listen, no, I appreciate it. You're welcome. But the thing is, you don't know how to play first space. Scott? That's right. It's not that hard, Scott. Tell him what. It's incredibly hard. Hey, anything we're doing is, and we're going to teach you. Wait a minute, here. I mean, what about Jason Skawne, Scott? John, you want me to take John to be spotted first base? Yeah. What about the fans? Yeah, maybe I can teach one of them. The fans to win. Good one. Fans to run my ball club. Honey, what are you doing awake? Sweetheart, can you? It's my daughter. You got kids? Yeah, I don't. Scott? This is a contract to play ball for the cleanities. Cop, he's been sent over to your agent. Discuss with your wife. Let us know. Thank you. My boy. Oh, Scott. Yeah. Don't tell him what about the first base thing. You're, sir. Happy holidays. All right.
