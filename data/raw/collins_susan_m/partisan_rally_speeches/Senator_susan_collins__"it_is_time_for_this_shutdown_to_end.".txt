 Senator from Mayan. Mr. President, today marks the fifth day of the government shutdown. With each passing day, the consequences grow more severe. More people are affected and the implications grow far more serious. Those civilian employees working to support our National Guard, overhaul our nuclear submarines, and analyze the latest terrorist threat are being furloughed, leaving us less safe as the country. Now I understand that this afternoon, Secretary Hegel in response to a letter that the presiding officer and I signed, along with many of our colleagues, is recalling some of those civilian workers. But there are still other implications. Disabled veterans who have sacrificed so much for this country are facing delays in the handling of their claims. Pregnant women and little children who depend on the foods provided by the WIC program are at risk. And vital biomedical research is being disrupted such that even the sickest children cannot enroll in clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health. And the impact goes beyond these services provided by essential federal programs. Jobs in the private sector are affected as well. In main hour gem of a National Park, Acadia National Park, is shuttered during the peak of the foliage season. It's not only disappoints tourists, it hurts in keepers, owners of bed and breakfast, organizations, servers at restaurants and small gift shop entrepreneurs who depend on these tourists during this time of year. The list of harm goes on and on and on and worsens with each passing day. It is time, Mr. President, for this shutdown to end. Mr. President, from the start of this debate, I've urged our House colleagues not to adopt a policy that linked Obamacare with the funding of government. I've been outspoken in my own opposition to Obamacare and have cast many of vote consistent with that position. I've co-sponsored and introduced Bill's reformed the law so that we can better rein in healthcare costs and truly help the uninsured without jeopardizing their jobs and without imposing billions of dollars of new taxes, fees and penalties that discourage job creation and drive up costs. But the fact is, Mr. President, the Democratic Senate is never going to pass nor is President Obama ever going to sign a bill that repeals his signature accomplishment. So now that we have all made crystal clear where we stand on Obamacare, it is past time that we reasoned together on how to bring this impasse to an end. In that regard, I must express my own disappointment and the lack of results from the President's meeting with congressional leaders and what I understand to be the President's refusal to enter into negotiations with Congress. So let me present to my colleagues and to the President for their consideration a proposal to bring an end to the shutdown. The proposal is based on concepts that have been discussed by Senator Pat Toomey and Congressman Charlie Dent. And they also reflect my own personal discussions with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Mr. President, even the staunchest advocates of Obamacare, including the President himself, recognize that the law is not perfect. Not 2,000 plus page law dealing with extremely complex issues could be. The President himself has delayed implementation of the employer mandate and certain consumer protections. I have, therefore, searched for common ground on reforming Obamacare, seeking a proposal that has widespread bipartisan support in order to attract the necessary votes of our house colleagues on both sides of the aisle. And that is the repeal of the 2.3 percent tax on the sales of medical equipment. And such an amendment repealing this tax was considered by the Senate during the budget resolution. It passed by a resounding vote of 79 to 20. Clearly it has strong bipartisan support. This $30 billion tax on medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators will cause the loss of as many as 43,000 domestic jobs according to industry estimates. It will reduce investment in research to produce new medical devices. And ironically, it will increase health care costs because the manufacturers will simply pass on the cost to consumers. Now the administration has protested the idea of repealing this tax because it would lose $30 billion in revenue over the next 10 years. Fair enough. Let's make up for the loss revenue by providing an offset. It's a complicated one, but it works. It's called pension smoothing. It would smooth out the amount of payments that businesses make into pension plans. This is not an unusual concept. New York State has adopted it to allow local school systems to reduce their annual pension contribution somewhat next year in exchange for higher payments in future years. The result of allowing private businesses to smooth out their pension contributions would produce tax revenue by lowering their deductions. And that could be used to offset the cost of repealing the tax on medical equipment. Second, I would propose that the continuing resolution funding government include a bipartisan bill that Senator Mark Udall and I introduced earlier this year to give agencies flexibility to deal with sequestration. It makes no sense at all for federal managers not to be able to set priorities and then submit their plans to the appropriations committees as they do now with reprogramming requests. Sequestration is a flawed policy. It does not discriminate between absolutely essential programs and those that are duplicative, wasteful or simply less important. Now it is Congress that should be making these decisions. But if across the board meet acts of sequestration stay in effect. The least we can do is let federal managers set priorities and manage their budgets subject to congressional oversight. Mr. President, it is my hope that if repeal of the medical equipment tax offsetfully by the pension-smoothing proposal plus the college Udall flexibility bill were combined with the continuing resolution of fund government, we might well have the combination necessary to secure the votes in reopen government. Surely it is worth a try. So on this late Saturday afternoon, I offered this proposal and I urged my House colleagues to send us such a bill which I would then urge the Senate Majority Leader to schedule for an immediate vote. Mr. President, we have a lot to do to restore the public's confidence in our ability to govern. We can start by offering and voting on specific proposals such as this one. It is time that both sides come out from their partisan corners, stop fighting and start legislating in good faith. The shutdown represents a failure to govern and must be brought to an end. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President. Senator from Louisiana.
