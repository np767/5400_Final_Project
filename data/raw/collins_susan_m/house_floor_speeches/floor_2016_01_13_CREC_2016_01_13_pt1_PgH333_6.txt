MORE EMPTY WORDS AT STATE OF THE UNION
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, for the past 7 years, President Obama has
given us 47,625 words of meaningless rhetoric. Last night's State of
the Union address was more of the same empty words.
President Obama has never adequately focused on what really matters
in this country: keeping America safe and defending our cherished
freedoms.
Instead, he wants to maintain the status quo and continues to promote
top-down, one-size-fits-all Federal dictates that stymie economic
growth. It is clear he doesn't understand the solutions that will get
our Nation back on track with the American people, not Washington
bureaucrats.
President Obama promised hope and change, but his failed agenda has
brought the wrong kind of change, and many North Carolinians are losing
hope.
Fortunately, Republicans are committed to restoring confidence in
America and empowering her people to make their own decisions and
pursue their own dreams.
