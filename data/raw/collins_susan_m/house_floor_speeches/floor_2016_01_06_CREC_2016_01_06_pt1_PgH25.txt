PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ACTIONS RESTRICT SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, as citizens of the United States, we are
afforded basic rights and privileges under the Constitution. One of
these fundamental rights is the Second Amendment, and its guarantee to
keep and bear arms is clear.
Yesterday, in yet another attempt to erode our basic liberties,
President Obama announced plans to undermine the will of Congress and
challenge the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.
Just like his unilateral actions on immigration, this proposal is an
overreach of the President's constitutionally granted executive
authority. Congressional refusal to pass bad policy does not transfer
legislative authority to the President, and I will fight against this
attempt to diminish our constitutional rights.
Guns are one of many tools that people use to commit horrific crimes,
but the problem of evil cannot be legislated away. It is important that
any legislative response, whether it is at the Federal, State, or local
level, ensures that the constitutional rights of all citizens are
protected.
