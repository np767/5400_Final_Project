LIEUTENANT WILLIAM D. LEBO POST OFFICE BUILDING
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the
bill (H.R. 3865) to designate the facility of the United States Postal
Service located at 101 South 8th Street in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, as
the ``Lieutenant William D. Lebo Post Office Building''.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 3865
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. LIEUTENANT WILLIAM D. LEBO POST OFFICE BUILDING.
(a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal
Service located at 101 South 8th Street in Lebanon,
Pennsylvania, shall be known and designated as the
``Lieutenant William D. Lebo Post Office Building''.
(b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,
document, paper, or other record of the United States to the
facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be
a reference to the ``Lieutenant William D. Lebo Post Office
Building''.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. Donalds) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) each
will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
General Leave
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks
and include extraneous material on this measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the
gentleman from Florida?
There was no objection.
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3865, which names a
Lebanon, Pennsylvania, post office for Lieutenant William D. Lebo.
Lieutenant Lebo was born in Vicenza, Italy, to American parents.
At the end of his father's service in the U.S. Army, the Lebo family
moved to Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. Lieutenant Lebo lived in Lebanon
County for the rest of his life and grew up to join the Lebanon City
Police Department, where he served for 40 years.
In March of 2022, 30 days before he was set to retire, Lieutenant
Lebo was shot and killed in the line of duty. Lieutenant Lebo died
protecting the community he grew up in, and I support this bill that
honors his legacy in Lebanon County.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
I rise in support of H.R. 3865 to designate the facility of the
United States Postal Service located at 101 South 8th Street in
Lebanon, Pennsylvania, as the Lieutenant William D. Lebo Post Office
Building.
I join Mr. Donalds in praising the work of Lieutenant Lebo. He had a
remarkable 40-year career with the Lebanon City Police Department, but
in March 2022, just 1 month before he was set to retire, Lieutenant
Lebo was killed while on duty.
I encourage my colleagues to join us in honoring the life of
Lieutenant Lebo by naming a post office in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, after
him.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
Donalds), my good friend, for yielding on this important issue. I also
thank my colleague from Maryland for his support.
Madam Speaker, it is truly my honor today to rise in support of this
community bill, H.R. 3865, which would rename the post office at 101
South 8th Street in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, as the Lieutenant William D.
Lebo Post Office Building.
Madam Speaker, Lieutenant Lebo, of the Lebanon City Police
Department, tragically lost his life in the line of duty on March 31,
2022, while responding to a domestic-related burglary incident.
During his memorial, my very good friend, Lebanon County District
Attorney Pier Hess Graf, said that Lieutenant Lebo's last words to his
men before entering the House that fateful day were, ``I'm going to go
in first, and I'm going to keep you safe.''
This is the kind of police officer Lieutenant Lebo was, a man who was
willing to give his life to protect his fellow officers. He served the
Lebanon Police Department and his community faithfully for 40 years and
was just 30 days from retirement at the time of his passing.
Madam Speaker, as the son of a police officer, the risk of our
finest, to protect and serve, needs never be forgotten and should
always be respected and certainly not taken for granted.
Lieutenant Lebo's fellow officers say there is not a day that goes by
without members of the department sharing fond stories of Lieutenant
Lebo. I am told a story often shared is that Lieutenant Lebo would
drive around in his patrol car with the windows down to better interact
with the community he served but also to more easily hear if someone
needed help. He was an incredibly community-oriented police officer who
really served as a model for law enforcement.
Lieutenant Lebo is survived by his loving wife, Lora; his daughter,
Corinne; and his mother, Rina. I am honored to have them joining us
here today in the House Chamber, along with the mayor of Lebanon city,
Sherry Capello, and Lebanon City Police Chief Bret Fisher. We are
honored to have them with us.
Lieutenant Lebo was known as a mentor to younger officers, whom he
loved training to be the best police officers that they could be.
As Chief Fisher has said: Somebody that has spent 40 years at the
police department as Lieutenant Lebo did, they are still with you in so
many ways. There isn't much you can touch or do that Lieutenant Lebo
didn't have his hand in somewhere along his career on the Lebanon City
Police Force.
To honor her husband's remarkable life, Lora Lebo established the
Lieutenant William D. Lebo Memorial Foundation, which is dedicated to
supporting the growth of Lebanon with positive intent, providing
educational scholarship to Lebanon County first responders and their
children, and providing comprehensive leadership development training
to the law enforcement community.
While Lora and the community have already done such great work
keeping Lieutenant Lebo's memory alive, it is my hope that the renaming
of this post office in his honor will further serve as a lasting
recognition of his life and legacy, during which he always put service
above self.
I do know that memorializing Lieutenant Lebo in this manner will be
so meaningful to the Lebanon community. While I attended Lieutenant
Lebo's funeral, it was overwhelmingly clear just how much he meant to
Lebanon and, in fact, to all of Pennsylvania. The procession, Madam
Speaker, was miles long, and people lined the streets to pay their
final respects.
Lieutenant Lebo was a dedicated public servant who is remembered by
his colleagues and those he served as a calm, kind, and ethical police
officer who was completely devoted to protecting the Lebanon community.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in supporting H.R. 3865 to
rename the post office in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, for a very deserving
local hero, Lieutenant William D. Lebo.
{time}  1630
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this
measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 3865.
The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
