HONORING THE SEVEN FAMILIES OF VICTIMS OF PERRY HIGH SCHOOL ATTACK
(Mr. NUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. NUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the
families who are grieving following an attack on Perry High School in
Iowa.
On January 4, 11-year-old Ahmir Jolliff, a sixth grader in our
community, died during an attack on his school. Ahmir's wonderful
mother, Erica, said her son, known as Smiley because of the dimples
that always lit up his face with a grin, believed in making every day
count, and we should all take this burden on seriously as we march
forward.
During this attack, Principal Dan Marburger heroically put himself in
harm's way to create an opportunity for students to run to safety, and,
in those few moments while he tried to talk down an active shooter, he
undoubtedly saved the lives of many in our community. However, for his
selfless actions, standing in harm's way, this week it is sad to report
that he has passed away.
As his daughter Claire said: Dad taught us and inspired us to be
better people every day. He passed many lessons and things on to us as
kids.
Undoubtedly, there are families in Perry who are still living the
life lessons that Dan Marburger taught. There is no doubt this impact
will live on in heavy, but also inspiring, ways as a mentor and an
educator in our community.
Mr. Speaker, our prayers are with the Marburger family and the people
of Perry.
