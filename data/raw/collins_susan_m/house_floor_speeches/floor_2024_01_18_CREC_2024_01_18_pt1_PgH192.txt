CELEBRATING THE SERVICE OF CHRISTINE HILL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Bost) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the service of one
of our staffers on the VA Committee.
Ms. Christine Hill has dedicated decades of her career to this
Nation's servicemembers, veterans, and their families.
She got her start in Congress as a military legislative assistant for
Elizabeth Dole before being appointed and confirmed by the Senate to
serve as the VA Assistant Secretary for congressional and legislative
affairs in the Bush administration.
Christine then went on to advocate for veterans in the VSO world
until we were able to bring her here to the committee where she has
served as the Subcommittee on Health staff director for over 10 years.
Christine has helped advance dozens of bills supporting veterans and
their families, most notably: giving veterans greater control over the
healthcare that works for them through the Choice and the VA MISSION
Acts, expanding mental health care and support through the Commander
John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act, fighting
for toxic-exposed veterans to get them the healthcare and benefits they
have earned through the PACT Act, and so many other landmark pieces of
legislation.
It is important to note that she only began her impressive civilian
career after a full 20-year career in the United States Air Force.
Christine's entire life is marked by service, and she, without
question, represents the best that America has to offer.
A graduate of the Air Force Academy, Christine held numerous
positions as a KC-135 navigator, flying combat support during Desert
Storm. Christine was handpicked to become the first woman assigned to
fly the B-1B bomber and concluded her military career at the Pentagon,
retiring as a lieutenant colonel.
You would never guess any of these things about Christine. She is one
of the kindest, most humble people I have ever met, and she has been an
absolute pleasure to work with during my time leading this committee.
She is a dear friend of mine, and she will be sorely missed.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Christine. I want her to have a wonderful life
in the things she pursues from here on out. This Nation thanks her for
the job she has done both in the military and for this institution.
