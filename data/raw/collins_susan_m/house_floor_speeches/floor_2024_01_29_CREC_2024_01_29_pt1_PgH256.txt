R&D CHANGES TO FEDERAL TAX CODE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a minute this morning to
again look at the 118th Congress, which just completed its first year
of operation last December, and it was sadly the least productive
Congress in memory.
Thirty-one bills were enacted during that first year of the 118th
Congress. Again, that is a fraction of the number of bills that have
been introduced in this Congress. That now surpasses 7,000 bills which
were introduced in the House and a comparable number in the Senate.
Obviously, much of the year was consumed with a lot of interparty
fighting with the majority party, but now with really a year left, it
is our duty to try and find bipartisan measures that are actually going
to help this country and address real problems for Americans.
The good news is, a week ago Friday, the Ways and Means Committee
reported out H.R. 7024, which is a bill aimed at making corrections and
improvements to the Tax Code that are long overdue.
There are three basic pieces to it.
Number one, it reinstated the child tax credit, which had been wiped
out after ARPA expired. This will basically take roughly half a million
children out of poverty. Low-income families don't qualify for the full
value of the child tax credit. Thankfully, the two sides came together
to come up with a meaningful fix. We really have more work to do,
because the initial version that was part of ARPA actually cut child
poverty in this country in half.
The second thing it did is it expanded the low-income housing tax
credit. We have a desperate need for more housing supply in this
country, and this will stimulate more investment by developers to build
more housing.
I want to be clear. Those units that will benefit from this will be
mixed income and will benefit working families and folks who are
desperate to find affordable places to live.
Mr. Speaker, what I really want to talk about is the research and
development tax deduction, which, in 2017, when the tax law was passed,
which I opposed at the time, it basically took the research and
development expensing mechanism that had been on the books since 1954,
which allowed businesses to write down the investments that they did in
new products, processes, workforce innovation, and basically forced
them to have to spread it out over 5 years, causing a huge hardship for
small businesses, particularly small manufacturers.
I have a poster next to me from the Westminster Tool company in
Plainfield, Connecticut. I visited it a few days ago. This is a firm
with 35 workers. Again, a family-owned business. They do great work in
terms of medical device manufacturing. They also make aerospace parts
that go into our F-35 program that is so critical to the Air Force and
the Navy.
When this new expensing mechanism went into effect, it is almost hard
to believe this, but their tax bill went up 355 percent. Again, for
companies like this, who don't have cash reserves to continue
innovating in terms of new products and processes, which Westminster
Tool does, this is basically a wipeout in terms of their ability to
invest.
This is showing up across the country. It was a terrible decision
back in 2017. This bill will resume having the annual expensing
mechanism, which will allow this company--and this is a picture with
Ray Coombs, who is to my immediate right there, the owner, and his two
daughters and his son, Colby, who are running the business. Behind him
is the president of the Eastern Manufacturing Alliance, which has been
desperately asking Congress to go back and fix this ridiculous change
which took place in the 2017 tax bill.
So, again, this is a pro-growth measure, which is going to allow
companies like this to get back on track in terms of innovation, which
is so important for us in keeping ahead of our global competitors and
creating jobs--good jobs, skilled jobs. Westminster Tool has been just
an absolute shining example of why we need to make this change.
Hopefully, we are going to get this across the finish line and make
sure that, again, the problem is fixed. We could do more; there is no
question about it. But the fact of the matter is, in this Congress, we
have to take Ws where we can and victories where we can to address real
problems for companies like Westminster Tool.
