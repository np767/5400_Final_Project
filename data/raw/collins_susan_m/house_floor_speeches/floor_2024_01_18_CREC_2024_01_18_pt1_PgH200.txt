CATHY GERAGHTY
(Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for
one minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my dear friend and champion
of biodiversity, Cathy Geraghty.
I am pleased to announce that Cathy is the 2023 recipient of the Dr.
George B. Rabb Force of Nature Award. During her two-decade-long career
with the Forest Preserves of Cook County, Cathy has pushed the
organization forward in tackling conservation issues, particularly with
her drafting of the Next Century Conservation Plan.
With an implementation strategy that includes volunteer outreach,
tying the preserves to the economic future of Chicago, restoring 30,000
acres to full health, and leading with transparency, this plan will
continue to improve our forest preserves and increase the community
that supports them.
When she isn't working with the Forest Preserves of Cook County, she
spends her free time serving as a proud member of the Chicago
Wilderness Alliance Steering Committee, who has awarded her this honor.
Cathy is a true force of nature, and I could not be more proud of my
friend and the work she has done to support our environment.
