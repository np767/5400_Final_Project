Nomination of Cristal C. Brisco
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm
Judge Cristal C. Brisco to the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Indiana.
Born in Granger, IN, Judge Brisco earned her B.A., cum laude, from
Valparaiso University in 2002 and her J.D. from the University of Notre
Dame Law School in 2006. After graduating from law school, Judge Brisco
worked as an associate in the litigation and labor and employment
department at Barnes & Thornburg, LLP from 2006 to 2013.
Following her work in private practice, she was appointed to serve as
the corporation counsel for the city of South Bend, IN, by then-Mayor
Pete Buttigieg. From 2017 to 2018, Judge Brisco served as the general
counsel of the Corporation of Saint Mary's College. After that, Judge
Brisco served as a magistrate judge on the St. Joseph Circuit Court--
Mishawaka Division, from 2018 to 2021. In July 2021, Judge Brisco was
appointed by Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb to serve as a judge on the
St. Joseph Superior Court. Then, in February 2022, Judge Brisco was
appointed by the Indiana Supreme Court to concurrent service on the
Indiana Commercial Court. During her time on the bench, she has issued
approximately 1,818 written decisions.
The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Brisco as ``well
qualified'' to serve as a district judge on the Northern District of
Indiana. She has the support of her home State Senators, Mr. Young and
Mr. Braun.
With deep ties to the Hoosier State, Judge Brisco's experience as a
superior court judge and former civil litigator have prepared her to
serve honorably on the Federal bench in Indiana.
I am proud to support her nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do
the same.
