Nomination of Jacquelyn D. Austin
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm
Judge Jacquelyn D. Austin to the U.S. District Court for the District
of South Carolina.
Born in Sumter, SC, Judge Austin earned her B.S. from the University
of South Carolina School of Engineering and her J.D. from the
University of South Carolina School of Law. After law school, Judge
Austin completed a clerkship for Judge Matthew J. Perry on the U.S.
District Court for the District of South Carolina. She then entered
private practice as a patent attorney for the Hardaway Law Firm, where
she was responsible for drafting and prosecuting patent applications
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Judge Austin also worked in
business litigation at Womble Carlyle Sandridge and Rice, PLLC, where
she handled matters ranging from intellectual property litigation to
Fair Housing Act claims.
In 2011, Judge Austin was appointed to an 8-year term as a federal
magistrate judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of South
Carolina. She was reappointed to the position in 2019. Throughout her
time on the bench, Judge Austin has issued thousands of reports and
recommendations. She also presides over the district's drug court
program, which identifies criminal defendants whose presence in the
criminal justice system is primarily a function of drug abuse rather
than independently motivated criminal behavior.
The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Austin as ``well
qualified,'' and she has the strong support of Senators Graham and
Scott.
Judge Austin's dedication to service, knowledge of the District of
South Carolina, and judicial experience make her an outstanding
nominee. I will vote in favor of her confirmation and encourage my
colleagues to do the same.
