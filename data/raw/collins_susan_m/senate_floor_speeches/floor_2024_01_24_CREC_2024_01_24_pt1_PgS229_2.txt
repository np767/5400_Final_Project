National School Choice Week
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express
my very strong support for school choice.
Sunday was the start of School Choice Week. Tens of thousands of
parents, students, and educators are going to celebrate the
accomplishments of the school choice movement.
I spent 40 years in education.
I was a government school teacher--better known as public school--
including in higher education. I was a coach. I was a mentor. For 40
years, I watched the school choice movement grow and change many, many
lives. I have seen the changes that school choice has brought for
students across our great country.
When I first started in education 40 years ago, there was no
opportunity for school choice. Homeschooling was very, very rare. But
our government schools were in better shape back then. Homeschooling
today is practically like attending a small school. Today, there are
about 2 million kids being homeschooled across our country.
Homeschooling is the fastest growing form of education in America. It
is growing because parents recognize that our schools are failing--I am
going to repeat that: failing--our kids. It is time for lawmakers
across this country at every level, including us, to recognize that our
schools are failing.
Over the past 40 years, I have watched our education system decline
with my own eyes. I have visited schools, parents, and principals in 49
States and American Samoa. What I saw sometimes was absolutely
shocking. And, for today, it is the main reason that I ran for this
seat here in the U.S. Senate. Education wasn't just a local problem; it
was a national problem.
By now, it is undeniable that our K through 12 education system is in
a crisis because of job protections and
[[Page S230]]
teachers unions. We spend more money on education in the United States
of America than any other country, but we are not in first place. We
are not even close. And that is a shame.
Before the pandemic, we were 8th in reading, 11th in science, and
30th in math. You can't blame that on the pandemic. Some like to. This
has been going on for a long time, even before the pandemic. It has
been getting worse and worse and worse.
Last year, we had the worst ACT scores in 30 years. Let me repeat
that. Last year, we had the worst ACT scores in 30 years. Nearly half
of all of our students could not meet a single ACT benchmark--half. The
most recent national report card showed a steep drop in reading and
math scores in almost every State. These were the lowest scores in the
last 20 years. Even Joe Biden's Secretary of Education called these
test scores ``appalling'' and ``unacceptable.''
In some cities, there are entire schools--entire schools--where zero
students can read or do math at the level that they are in. In Chicago
alone, there are 55 schools where zero students can read or do math at
grade level. Children in these schools are being robbed of their
future. Our K through 12 system is failing. It is failing to prepare
our kids for college or for life.
When I talk about education, I often hear my Democratic colleagues
argue that we don't spend enough money. Their answer to everything is
to spend more. We pay more than any other country in the world, and,
again, we are not even in the top 10 with some of these countries that
spend a lot less. We pay $14,000 per student in this country in our
public and government schools. In other developed countries, it is
$11,000 or less. So we are spending nearly 40 percent more money, but
we are not getting 40 percent better test scores. We are getting a lot
less. We are 26th in math in this country competing against other
countries across the world--26th.
If you can't do math, you can't survive in today's world of
technology. You can't pay your bills if you can't do math. How are we
going to compete in a modern, high-tech economy if we can't do math? I
don't think anybody has thought about that. We just keep going on down
the same road.
According to the National Science Foundation, China graduated 1.2
million engineers in 2016. We graduated 130,000. One third of Chinese
college students major in engineering. In America, it is 7 percent. How
are we going to compete against our biggest adversary, China, if we are
not educated? Kids in China are learning calculus, and this is in
elementary school. Kids in China are learning calculus while our kids
are studying pronouns and 50 genders and critical race theory. It is a
disservice. We are cheating our kids. Frankly, it is a national
security issue.
My Democratic colleagues need to remember that our education system
does not exist for the sake of the teachers or principals and
administrators, or even coaches. It doesn't exist for that. It is not
about our teachers unions. It is about our students getting an
education, learning to read and write, do math, preparing for a future.
We forgot about that. Unfortunately, we forgot about that for a long
time. It is about preparing kids for life--what an idea.
So what is school choice? School choice just means funding the
student instead of the school building. That is what we do now: We send
all of our money to these school buildings. We put it in teachers and
administrators. The money is not going to exactly where it should be
going--to prepare students for life.
It is the idea that the school was made for the student, not the
student for the school. School choice brings the power of the free
market, which is what we are supposed to be, to our education system.
The results benefit everyone, even kids in the government or public
schools.
Studies show that school choice means better test scores and better
outcomes for students. When we talk about choice, my Democratic
colleagues will say: If you are for school choice, then you are against
public and government schools.
That is not true. That is not true. I used to teach in a public or
government school. I was a member of the teachers union. I want our
government schools to be the best in the world--the best--not 2nd, not
10th, not 20th, but the best. Our schools--our public and government
schools--should be good enough to compete with our private schools,
which are growing every day, but right now most of them are not. They
are not competing against other schools. They don't have to compete
because nothing is going on in the majority of our public schools. It
is just a simple fact.
There is a laundry list of things we need to do about our public and
government schools. But to make it better, what should be at the top of
the list is competition, which is school choice--school choice to go
where you want to go.
There are 20 studies--20 studies--that have shown that school choice
improves our public schools. This is because school choice forces
government schools to compete for students. And that is what this
country is about. It is about competition. It is about the opportunity
to do what you want, but it is all built on competition. Competition
makes everyone better, whether it is in football, business, or just
life. Competition makes us all better.
Kids deserve teachers, deserve teachers and schools that will compete
for them, not for a teachers union but for them. The job is to make our
students better, and we are failing.
A child's education should not be decided--should not be decided--on
their ZIP Code, where they live. Their education should not be decided
on their family's income. That is not the way this should work. It
should be decided by the people who know them best and love them the
most--which is who? Their parents. Parents are a big part of the
equation.
When I was a coach, I always told my players that this country owes
you only one thing, and that is an opportunity. I didn't care who you
were. When I coached, I didn't care whether you were rich, poor,
Protestant or Catholic, Jewish. It didn't make any difference what race
you were. I was hired to teach football and to win games. It is no
different in a classroom. Everybody has that opportunity. And don't
give me ``Everybody doesn't have that opportunity.'' They do. You just
have to take that opportunity and run with it.
So, at the end of the day, the key to unlock that opportunity is
what? It is education. If you can't read and write in our country, in
which we are struggling at almost every school--if you can't read and
write, you can't make it. You are going to end up living off the
government, and that is not what this country is about.
So our future is built on our kids. If we don't educate our kids, we
won't have much of a future, and it has really declined. But if we
unleash--and I know we have got a lot of problems going on in our world
today, in our country, a lot of division. But if we unleash the
potential of our young people, there is nothing that we cannot achieve.
So I urge my colleagues to support school choice in the upcoming
budget process. Give them the opportunity to compete. Give them the
opportunity for a better education. Put the pressure on our public and
government schools. Make them compete to keep their students there. And
the way you do that is you educate students. Get it to a point where we
don't need school choice or homeschooling.
This should not be a partisan issue. This should not be about
Republican and Democrat. This is about Americans. This is about
Americans, giving them the opportunity to succeed and achieve. This is
a huge American issue. We had better wake up and smell the roses. It is
about basic American values--the values of education for all,
opportunity for all, and letting our people live out their God-given
potential, not keeping it locked up. Give everybody that opportunity.
I yield the floor.
