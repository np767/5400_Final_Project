Senator Collins’ Statement on Senate Approval to Release the Epstein Files
WASHINGTON, D.C.
– Today, U.S. Senator Susan Collins released the following statement after the U.S. Senate unanimously approved legislation to release the Epstein files:
“I support the release of the Epstein files. This is an important step for the survivors of these heinous crimes. The legislation allows for appropriate redactions to be made to ensure that the identities of the victims and their other personal information are protected,”
said Senator Collins.
“In July, I supported an amendment that would facilitate the release of these files during a markup I chaired in the Senate Appropriations Committee. The amendment was approved unanimously by the Committee. I am glad the full Senate could unite for this vote for the victims of Mr. Epstein.”
