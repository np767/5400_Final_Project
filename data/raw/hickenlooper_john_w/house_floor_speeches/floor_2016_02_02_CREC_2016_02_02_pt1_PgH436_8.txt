ROADBLOCK HUMAN TRAFFICKING
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute.)
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak up on behalf of the
millions of people across the world who suffer under the injustice of
modern-day slavery.
Last month the House observed Human Trafficking Awareness Month to
shine light on this horrific crime. The injustice of human trafficking
knows no political party or geographical boundary. It happens right in
our backyards.
Yesterday the House took important steps in passing two bills to
strengthen our response to trafficking. I have also recently introduced
H.R. 4406, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act,
legislation which ensures the Department of Labor effectively trains
its employees to recognize and respond to the illegal trade of people
for exploitation or commercial gain.
It will take close coordination from stakeholders at every level to
eradicate this unthinkable crime. Together, our voices and actions can
help bring freedom to the oppressed.
