GUN CONTROL EXECUTIVE ACTIONS
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the President's
executive actions to curb gun violence and urge my colleagues to take
the action needed to address this deadly plague.
I rise today in honor of more than 300 lives lost to gun violence in
Detroit, a city I represent, just in 2015. That is nearly as many lives
as we have days in the year.
We have failed to take meaningful action. We must pass legislation to
support the President's executive actions.
We have heard a lot of dialogue this week. If you don't like the
executive actions, then Congress must rise and let's take the action
needed.
We can no longer sit on the sideline and allow this plague and this
horrific violence in our country to continue. We must take action now
before another day passes and another innocent life is destroyed.
