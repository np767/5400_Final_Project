FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT
(Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, last year, Volkswagen was caught
defrauding its customers selling vehicles that emitted 40 times more
pollution than is allowed by law in its so-called clean diesel models.
VW customers paid extra for vehicles they believed were both cleaner
and better performing than other cars on the market, but that is not
what they got. They have a right to join class action lawsuits to
recoup their losses and hold VW accountable.
But the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, which we will
consider
[[Page H180]]
today, would weaken the ability of those customers to pursue class
action claims. In the case of VW, the bill would limit classes to
people with the same vehicle model, the same emissions-cheating device,
and the same emissions system, even though all clean diesel customers
were defrauded in the same way. It would shrink the class sizes and
make it easier for VW to defeat or settle claims.
Why would we make it easier for VW to avoid responsibility by making
it harder for Americans to pursue justice?
It is shameful that congressional Republicans are trying to do
Volkswagen's bidding by weakening the rights their constituents
currently have.
I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill.
