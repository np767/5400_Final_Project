WELCOMING REVEREND NATHANIEL DEMOSTHENE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentlewoman from New
York (Mrs. Lowey) is recognized for 1 minute.
There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Reverend Nathaniel ``Nate''
Demosthene of Nyack, New York, for offering today's opening prayer.
A graduate of Spring Valley High School and of Yale University,
Pastor Nate teaches in the East Ramapo Central School District and at
Rockland Community College.
For the last 5 years, he has led First Timothy Christian Church,
which, under his guidance, has been a source of support for Haitian
Americans in our community following the devastating earthquake in
Haiti.
Together we will continue to work toward our shared goals of
democracy, prosperity, and success for the Haitian people.
Again I thank Pastor Nate for his excellent work and for being here
today.
