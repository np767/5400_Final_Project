PLANNED PARENTHOOD
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, we have barely started 2016 and here we
are, about to take our 62nd vote to dismantle the Affordable Care Act
and facing the 11th attack on women's health care in the 114th
Congress. Defunding Planned Parenthood and dismantling the ACA will rob
hardworking Americans of affordable family planning, and it will strip
life-saving cancer screenings away from millions of women across the
country.
As Congress, we haven't taken 62 votes to improve women's health and
access to healthcare programs for women and seniors. The 114th Congress
hasn't declared war on the appalling lack of healthcare, nutrition, and
mental health programs.
But here we are again, wasting valuable tax dollars in order to
rehash the ideology of a loud few, one that hurts women and our most
vulnerable of constituents. This is just a sad and shameful day.
Congress, this must stop.
