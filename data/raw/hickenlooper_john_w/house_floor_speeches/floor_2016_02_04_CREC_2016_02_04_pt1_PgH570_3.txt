HONORING THE MEMORY OF JIM TRULL
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute.)
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of a respected
constituent of mine whom I was proud to have called a dear friend.
James Trull was the kind of leader who could be depended on to bring
people together and advance solutions on behalf of their communities.
He was passionate about water issues. It was his life's work. He served
as the district manager of the Sunnyside Valley Irrigation District for
34 years. He understood the complicated western water law like no one
else. Jim was a valued leader in our community. He was kind and was
loved by those who knew him.
While Jim will be missed by many, we can honor his legacy by striving
to follow the kind of leadership he embodied in his life.
As we remember Jim, the passage from the Prophet Isaiah comes to
mind: ``For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon
the dry ground . . .''
I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering my friend, Jim Trull.
