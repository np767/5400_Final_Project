IN HONOR OF DR. FRED PRIMM
(Ms. SEWELL asked and was given permission to address the House for
one minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life
and legacy of Dr. Fred Primm, who passed away on January 19, 2024, at
the age of 57.
Dr. Primm was a true Renaissance man. He was an educator, Air Force
Naval Reservist, pastor, teacher, coach, adjunct professor, consultant,
a Kappa man, and the superintendent for Sumter County Schools and
Bessemer City Schools.
Dr. Primm was truly a respected and beloved community leader.
Educated at Alabama A&M, Auburn, and Nova Southeastern, Dr. Primm was a
true servant leader, and he led in every aspect of his life. He made
his commitment to serving others his life's top priority, and serve he
did. Our community and the lives of his students are all the better
because of him.
His life is a true testament to the transformational power of
education.
I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the exceptional life
and legacy of Dr. Fred Primm.
May his family find comfort in knowing that his legacy will live on
in the many lives that he touched.
