HONORING THE LIFE OF PHIL NEIGHBORS
(Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Phil Neighbors.
Phil was a pillar in the San Angelo community, and I had the pleasure
of working with him frequently over the last 10 years. Phil dedicated
his life to three things: to God, to his family, and to his community.
He and his wife, Susan, had two children together and four
grandchildren. It was not uncommon for Phil to run straight to a city
event from his grandsons' ball games. He always made time for both his
family and the city of San Angelo.
A graduate of Angelo State University, he led the San Angelo Chamber
of Commerce for the last 10 years. He was the bridge between the
Goodfellow Air Force Base and the San Angelo community, helping to
create a strong and lasting bond. He loved our military and was always
willing to support our military in any way that he could.
As a deacon in the Baptist church, Phil led the church's college
program and many mission trips to Mexico. He was a selfless servant, a
trait that extended beyond the city's, State's, and country's borders.
We lost Phil far too soon, just days after his 64th birthday. San
Angelo lost a truly great leader yesterday. Please join me in
remembering the extraordinary life of my friend, Phil Neighbors.
