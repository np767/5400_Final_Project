VOTE EXPLANATION
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I regret missing the vote on the
motion to invoke cloture on the veto message on S.J. Res. 22, a bill
that would block implementation of the Waters of the United States rule
and prevent the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of
Engineers from reissuing a regulation that is substantially similar in
the future. I voted against S.J. Res. 22 last fall and, had I been
present, I would have voted to uphold the President's veto. While this
rule is not perfect, it provides important environmental protection
efforts.
