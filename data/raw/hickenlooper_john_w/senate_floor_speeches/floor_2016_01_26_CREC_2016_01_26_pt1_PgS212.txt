ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 27, 2016
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, with that little update on the
weather--and again, a recognition of the hardy souls who kind of like
winter--I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its
business today, it
[[Page S213]]
adjourn until 11 a.m., Wednesday, January 27; that following the prayer
and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of
proceedings be approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be
reserved for their use later in the day; further, that following leader
remarks, the Senate begin consideration of S. 2012; finally, that the
Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly
conference meetings.
Program
Before we conclude, I do want to let Members know that we are very
serious about moving quickly and aggressively on the Energy Policy
Modernization Act when we take it up tomorrow. Given that we have a
very shortened workweek and a lot to do, I am going to ask colleagues
to engage with us. Senator Cantwell and I have both been here all
weekend working on this. I am not carrying this binder around because I
want to keep my muscles in shape for the next shoveling. I am carrying
it around because we have good stuff within this Energy Policy
Modernization Act that we want to get moved through. It is going to
require a great level of cooperation, but we are going to be ready to
hit the ground running and try to move quickly through this very, very
important legislation.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the Senator's
request?
Hearing none, it is so ordered.
In my personal capacity as the Senator from Maine, I wish to commend
the Senator from Alaska for her diligence and for being here today.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. The accolades go both ways, Madam President.
