VOTE EXPLANATION
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, unfortunately, due to COVID-19, I was
unable to attend the September 30 rollcall vote No. 247 on passage of
the bill H.R. 5860, a bill making continuing appropriations for fiscal
year 2024 and for other purposes, which passed by a vote of 88-9. Had I
been able to attend, I would have voted in support of passage.
