CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, we have a problem--money. Six years ago
today, the U.S. Supreme Court made the problem worse, a lot worse.
Thanks to the Supreme Court, our system of elections is riddled with
corruption. Money floods our political system--money that lets a
handful of billionaires shape who gets into Congress and may decide who
sits in the White House.
As Congress has become more beholden to billionaires and less worried
about the American people, look at what has happened in Washington.
Armies of lawyers and lobbyists flood the hallways of Congress and
regulatory agencies, urging just a little tilt for every law and every
rule--a sentence here, an exception there, and always tilted in favor
of the rich and powerful. Corporate executives and government officials
spin through the revolving door, making sure the interests of powerful
corporations are always carefully protected. Powerful Wall Street
businesses pay barely disguised bribes, offering millions of dollars to
trusted employees to go to Washington for a few years to make policies
that will benefit exactly those same Wall Street businesses.
Corporations and trade groups fund study after study that just so
happen to support the special rule or the exception that the industry
is looking for.
Washington works great for a handful of wealthy individuals and
powerful corporations that manipulate the system to benefit themselves.
It works great for the lobbyists and the lawyers who slither around
Washington day in and day out, handsomely paid to troll for special
deals for those who pay them. But for everyone else, Washington is not
working so well, and if we don't change that, this rigged political
game will break our country.
Change is needed in many areas, but we can start with how we fund
elections. In 2012, about 3.7 million Americans gave modest donations--
under $200--to President Obama and Mitt Romney. Those donations added
up to $313 million. In the same election, 32 people gave monster
donations to super PACs. Thirty-two people spent slightly more on the
2012 elections than the 3.7 million people who sent modest dollar
donations to their preferred Presidential candidates. When 32 people
can outspend 3.7 million citizens, it is pretty obvious that democracy
is in real danger.
We are headed into another Presidential election, and I speak out
today because I am genuinely alarmed for our democracy. I am genuinely
alarmed because 6 years ago today the U.S. Supreme Court said that the
privileged few are entitled under the Constitution to spend billions of
dollars to swing elections and buy off legislators. Six years ago today
the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a century of established law and in
doing so unleashed a flood of secret corporate money into our political
system.
The Supreme Court created a big problem, but that does not mean that
anyone with any integrity must just roll over and play dead. No, it is
time to fight back. Sure, the Supreme Court has a lot of power, and,
yes, they have used it to do a huge amount of damage. But even under
the Supreme Court ruling there is room to fight back against the
complete capture of our government by the rich and powerful.
Let's start right here with three examples of what this Congress
could do right now today--what this Congress could do if we had the
political courage to stand up to the superwealthy few and a handful of
corporations.
No. 1, pass Senator Durbin's Fair Elections Now Act. This legislation
would create public funding for congressional elections. Imagine the
contributions of small donors so working families would have a louder
voice and could begin to compete with the rich and powerful. This is a
bipartisan solution--well, at least bipartisan outside Washington.
According to a recent poll, Democrats and Republicans both agreed
strongly with the idea of citizen-funded elections; 72 percent of
Democrats and 62 percent of Republicans said yes.
No. 2, pass the DISCLOSE Act, Senator Whitehouse's bill to force
super PACs out of the shadows and make them tell where the money comes
from. According to that same poll, 91 percent of Democrats and 91
percent of Republicans agree that super PACs and other special
interests should have to disclose the source of their funding.
No. 3, pass the Shareholder Protection Act, Senator Menendez's bill
to force companies to tell their shareholders how much money they are
giving to politicians and which politicians they are giving it to. This
is the shareholders' money, and they have a right to know how it is
spent. If they don't like how the money is being spent, they can put
somebody else in charge.
Those are three things Congress could do right now, but there is even
more.
No. 4, the President could finalize an Executive order requiring
government contractors to disclose their political spending. Why should
companies that do business with the government be allowed to give money
in secret to benefit elected officials? Seventy-eight percent of
Democrats and 66 percent of Republicans want to see this done.
No. 5, the SEC has the authority right now to begin to put together
rules that would require opinion corporations to disclose the money
they spent in elections. Despite Republican efforts to try to block
this rule through a rider in the recent government funding bill, legal
experts agree that the agency still has all the authority it needs to
prepare a disclosure rule.
The public demands action. The SEC has received more than a million
comments from the people across this country urging the agency to issue
this rule--88 percent of Democrats and 88 percent of Republicans. That
is right, 88 percent of both sides support public disclosure of
political spending.
Three former SEC Commissioners, one Republican, two Democrats, wrote
a public letter to Chair Mary Jo White urging her to adopt this rule.
It is time for the agency to stop making excuses and start doing its
job.
No. 6, the FEC has the authority right now to require ads run by
super PACs include disclosure of the main people or corporations that
paid for them. If they want to run the country, then the billionaires
shouldn't be allowed to hide in the shadows. Make them step out in the
open where the American people can see who is calling the shots.
There is one more step we can take, a full-blown constitutional
amendment, such as the one pushed forward by my colleague Senator Udall
to restore authority to Congress and to the States.
I have to say, I am reluctant to take on a constitutional amendment,
but we need to defend our great democracy against those who would see
it perverted into one more rigged game where the rich and the powerful
always win, and that means taking every step possible, including
amending the Constitution.
These are six ideas that would help bring an end to a corrupt
political system; six ideas that Congress, the administration, the SEC,
and the FCC could put together right now.
A seventh idea is a constitutional amendment that we could begin
working on today. This Congress doesn't lack for workable ideas for how
to root out the influence of money in politics. This Congress just
lacks a spine to do it.
Six years ago the U.S. Supreme Court turned loose a flood of hidden
money that is about to drown our democracy. We can blame the Supreme
Court--heck, we should blame the Supreme Court, but that is no excuse
for doing nothing.
A new Presidential election is upon us. The first votes will be cast
in Iowa in just 11 days. Anyone who shrugs and claims that change is
just too hard has crawled into bed with the billionaires who want to
run this country like some private club. All of us were sent here to do
our best to make government work--to make it work not just for those at
the top but to make government work for all people, and it is time we
start acting like it.

Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.
