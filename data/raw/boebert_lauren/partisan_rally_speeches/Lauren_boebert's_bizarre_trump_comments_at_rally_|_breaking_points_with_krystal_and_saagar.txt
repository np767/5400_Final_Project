 A very bizarre moment at a Trump rally over the weekend where representative Lauren Bobert in one of the most cringe-worthy displays of fealty to Donald Trump revealed something really weird about Trump herself and her relationship with her child. Let's take a listen. I want to tell you a story about his generosity, about how kind he is, about how welcoming he is. The things that these folks right here in the back never let anyone see. Fake media is the virus. My family and I were with President Trump and even not liking germs, President Trump shared a bowl of popcorn with my 14-year-old son. Now listen Wyoming, I know where he's been, I don't share food with my son. But President Trump welcomed him and engaged with him and showed him love and respect just like I've seen him do with hundreds and thousands of other people all throughout America because he's not a politician, he's a family man, he's a businessman and he loves you, he loves America and he will be back again. Um, okay, so I have a lot of questions. Number one, you don't share food with your son. Number two, if it's true that your 14-year-old son is a grubby and filthy, that's actually an indictment of you as a mother. And two, why would you let him then share popcorn with the, let's just say unhealthy OB-summon president of the United States. So on all levels, this is a major indictment. And also just a cro- I don't know. My major question is, is this a real person or is this like a performance project? Because I mean, even the whole thing to like those people in the back row won't tell you the truth about President Trump sharing popcorn. I mean, it's just so... There is a lot going on. It's funny because, you know, the like, what did you say fake news is the virus? Yeah, that was funny. Oh my god. Yeah. They just take these sort of hashtags and slogans from the past. I mean, this has been a long time now since 2016. It's just kind of like replaying, recycling the same hits from the early days. And it's got that vibe of like, you know, tried now the old faithful hits for the crowd. Yeah, also your bar is super low. If this is what you consider to be like... That's all you got. The real tell of like a great... Oh my god, you shared a bowl of popcorn. Don't you have something about him in a veteran or something? You know, yeah, like... It reminded me of Kaylee McAnany told this story about after she'd had surgery and that he called her... Oh, that's right. And this is like so incredibly moving to her that someone who she's supposedly close to, she spends like all her time with, bothered to call her. Like, that's nice. That's a very low bar in terms of holding this up. This is the extraordinary character of this man that the fake news won't tell you about. It's all weird. It's also weird to just be like, you know, with any politician, the way that we treat these people like they're supposed to be our daddy figure or something is also very strange to me. I just completely agree. Yeah, I just, I saw that. I, Jen, I could not get over it. Just in terms of what it says about her, what it says about him. It's like, that's all you got. The fact that the crowd loved it. There's just, I don't know, man, I just bear for this country sometimes. Indeed. Okay. I'm more of you guys later.
