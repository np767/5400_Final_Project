Warren: Government Funding Deal A “Mistake”
Washington, D.C. —
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released the following statement on a deal to fund the government without lowering health care costs.
“I will not support a deal that does nothing to make health care more affordable. The fight to lower costs is a righteous fight, and we must not give it up.
“Republicans in Congress extended tax breaks for billionaires and billionaire corporations, but they refused to extend tax credits to lower health insurance premiums for millions of working people. A simple one-year extension of these tax credits would cost less than Donald Trump’s $40 billion bailout for Argentina.
“Donald Trump has made clear that he is willing to hurt people—hungry children, federal employees, working families—in order to get his way. The wannabe king may declare victory today, but Americans will remember his actions.
“While Trump and Republicans inflict more pain on people, Democrats’ most important job is to fight back. We will keep fighting to fix our broken health care system and lower costs for working people, but a vote for this legislation is a mistake.”
