Washington, D.C.
- U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, alongside Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and U.S. Representative Maggie Goodlander (D-N.H.), urged the Acting Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees to investigate whether Genesis Healthcare Inc. (Genesis) is attempting to exploit the bankruptcy system at the expense of victims, workers, and other businesses.
“Genesis [...] may be abusing our bankruptcy system to wipe away Genesis’s debts and claims to victims by selling the company at a discount to insiders,”
wrote the lawmakers.
“Genesis’s takeover by private equity companies JER Partners and ReGen preceded worse outcomes for patients, while investors reaped the profits and left the company with unsustainable finances.”
On July 9, 2025, Genesis, one of the largest post-acute care providers in the country, filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, affecting nearly 200 skilled nursing facilities and senior living centers across 18 states, with more than 15,000 residents and 27,000 employees. At the time of the filing, Genesis
owed
patients, patients’ families, and other individuals who won lawsuits against them an estimated $259 million, with some experts estimating further debts to victims could reach $344 million. These lawsuits stem from serious allegations of improper care, abuse, inadequate training, unsafe conditions, and wrongful death.
Despite a record of mismanagement, Genesis has proposed to sell itself to some of the same individuals who helmed the company preceding its bankruptcy, raising concerns that Genesis may be abusing the bankruptcy system to wipe away Genesis’s debts and claims to victims by selling the company at a discount to insiders. A joint letter received by the lawmakers from ReGen, the current owner of Genesis, and CPE 88988, the prospective owner, indicates no attempt for a full or substantial recovery of funds for patients and families, small businesses, or employee pension funds.
“We are concerned that Genesis…could be incentivized to pay out debts to current Genesis insiders completely or almost completely, while non-insiders like patient victims and vendors ‘may get nothing,’”
the lawmakers concluded
. “The parties’ refusal to respond to questions regarding the structure of Genesis and ReGen – despite Genesis’s ‘commit[ment] to maintaining transparency’ – is a red flag that warrants investigation prior to approval of the sale.”
On October 8, 2025, Senators Warren, Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Representative Maggie Goodlander (D-N.H)
launched
an investigation into Genesis Healthcare, pushing for information related to Genesis’s private equity-caused bankruptcy and its apparent attempt to use the bankruptcy process to wipe away the company’s debts to victims and businesses by selling the company at a discount to insiders. The U.S. Trustee’s Office is the federal government’s bankruptcy watchdog and is tasked with preventing fraud, dishonesty, and overreaching in the bankruptcy system on behalf of taxpayers.
Senator Warren, one of the nation’s leading bankruptcy experts, has led the fight to expose private equity’s role in raising costs and lowering quality of care for patients in health care facilities, including private equity’s abuse of the bankruptcy system:
