Fetterman Statement on Government Shutdown
Washington, D.C.
– Tonight, the federal government will officially shut down after Congress failed to pass a funding bill before the September 30 deadline. U.S. Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) released the following statement:
“It’s a sad day for our nation.
“Our government shuts down at midnight.
“I voted AYE to extend ACA tax credits because I support them—but I won’t vote for the chaos of shuttering our government.
“My vote was for our country over my party.
“Together, we must find a better way forward.”
Senator Fetterman voted in favor of House and Senate Democrats’ alternative Continuing Resolution that would have kept the government open while negotiations on full-year bipartisan appropriations continue. The Democrats’ proposal would have extended the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, reversed GOP Medicaid cuts, and ensured Congress—not President Trump or OMB Director Russell Vought—determines how taxpayer dollars are spent. No Senate Republicans supported the measure.
