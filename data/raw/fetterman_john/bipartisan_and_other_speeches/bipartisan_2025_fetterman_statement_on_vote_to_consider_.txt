Fetterman Statement on Vote to Consider House’s Defense Appropriations Bill
WASHINGTON, D.C.
– Today, U.S. Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) voted to consider H.R.4016, the
Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2026
.
Senator Fetterman released the following statement:
“I voted YES to start considering the House’s defense spending bill because I believe the men and women in our military, who put their lives at risk for our country, should not have to worry about their paycheck coming through.
“To be clear, we should be considering the Senate’s bill because it’s the better version, and I worked hard to secure key investments for Pennsylvania in it.
“Regardless, this bill would still make sure our servicemembers get paid, and I will continue to vote to end this shutdown and reopen our federal government so all workers can move on from this chaos.”
Since the government shut down, Senator Fetterman has continued to cast his vote to put politics aside and open the government. He has cast his vote seven times for the Democratic Continuing Resolution to extend the Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits and has cast his vote nine times for the Republican Continuing Resolution to fund our government. Both Continuing Resolutions have failed to reach the sixty-vote threshold.
