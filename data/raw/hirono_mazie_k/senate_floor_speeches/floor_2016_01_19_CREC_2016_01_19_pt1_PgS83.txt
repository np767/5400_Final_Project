ADOPTEE CITIZENSHIP ACT
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Adoptee
Citizenship Act, legislation that will secure citizenship for adopted
children. I wish to thank Senator Coats for cosponsoring the bill with
me, along with Senator Merkley, and Senator Gillibrand is also a
cosponsor.
The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 guaranteed citizenship to most
international adoptees. This was very important because sometimes
children have been adopted, they come over to live in this country for
years, and, in fact, for some reason--the paperwork wasn't filed--they
do not actually have their citizenship. The problem with that law back
in 2000 was that it did not apply to adoptees who were over 18 at the
time the bill was passed. I am sure there were some reasons for that,
but it really makes no sense because a kid who was 17 at the time and
had been legally adopted was no different from a child who was 19 at
the time who had been legally adopted.
What our bill does is very limited. It fixes that. The loophole
denies some adult adoptees the right to citizenship even though they
were legally adopted by U.S. citizens and raised in the United States.
They are over 18, so they have for the most part lived in the United
States for a very long period of time. In fact, they were over 18 back
in the year 2000.
The bipartisan Adoptee Citizenship Act would fix this problem by
giving citizenship to international adoptees--people who were legally
adopted, who were 18 in the year 2000 or older--regardless of how old
they were when the Child Citizenship Act passed. These adoptees grew up
in American families, they went to American schools, they lead American
lives, yet adopted children who are not covered by the Child
Citizenship Act are not guaranteed citizenship. Because of their lack
of citizenship, adoptees have been refused admission to college and
turned down for jobs. This constant threat to the life they know is
unjust, and this bill would simply ensure that international adoptees
are recognized as the Americans they truly are.
The bill is especially important in my home State of Minnesota. Many
people don't know this, but Minnesota actually has one of the highest
rates of international adoption in the country. Minnesota families have
opened their homes and their hearts to children from all over the
world--from Vietnam, to Guatemala, to Nepal, to Haiti.
As cochair of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I have worked
with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support adoptive
families and children. Our children--all kids--deserve so much more
than a roof over their heads and a bed to sleep in. Each and every
child deserves a loving home, a nurturing family, and a brighter
future. That is what this bill is all about. It fixes something. It
closes a loophole. It has bipartisan support. I ask my colleagues to
consider voting for it. There is obviously a lot of interest from
adoptees all across the country who have been living with this, through
no fault of their own, for years and years and years.
