REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT COLONEL KENNETH R. JOHNSON
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the
life and honor the service of Vietnam veteran Lt. Col. Kenneth R.
Johnson. Lieutenant Colonel Johnson passed away on August 29, 2015, and
was laid to rest January 14, 2016, at Arlington National Cemetery. Born
and raised in Minneapolis, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson enjoyed playing
music with his garage band, the Commodores, and studying airplanes.
Upon graduating from Roosevelt High School in 1955, Johnson enlisted in
the Minnesota Air National Guard, where he served for 2 years before
entering the U.S. Air Force Academy to become an officer.
After he received his commission as a second lieutenant, Johnson went
on to earn his wings and begin his career flying the F-100 Super Sabre,
one of the planes that he would fly during the Vietnam war. It was in
this plane that Johnson earned the Silver Star, defending the Tong Le
Chan Special Forces camp, heroically making nine passes at low altitude
against intense hostile fire in support of our troops. Later in the
war, after being forced to eject over North Vietnam, Johnson would
spend nearly 15 months as a POW in Hanoi. Despite this trying time,
Johnson's resolve and the love he had for his country remained intact,
and he continued to serve for many years after his release in 1973.
Our country will always need brave men like Lt. Col. Kenneth R.
Johnson. He embodied our Nation's most cherished values and served as
an example to us all. Today my thoughts and prayers are with his
family, including his brother Phil; his two sons, Bradley and David;
and his sister, Delores. May we always remember and cherish his
memory.
