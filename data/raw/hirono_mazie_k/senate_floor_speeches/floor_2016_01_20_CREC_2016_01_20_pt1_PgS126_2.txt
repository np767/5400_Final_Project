230TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VIRGINIA STATUTE FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, in 1992, the House and Senate joined
together to pass a resolution designating January 16 as Religious
Freedom Day to celebrate one of the most powerful and unique freedoms
within our Nation's founding and fabric. This day is significant
because it marks the passage of the 1786 Virginia Statute for Religious
Freedom originally authored by Thomas Jefferson.
2016 marks the 230th anniversary of the passage of this statute that,
as Congress recognized, ``inspired and shaped the guarantees of
religious freedom in the First Amendment.'' It reads in part: ``. . .
no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship,
place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced . . . in his body
or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious
opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by
argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that
the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil
capacities.''
The Founders understood that there is a direct connection between the
prosperity and health of a nation and its respect for human rights and
religious freedom. Individual faith grows
[[Page S127]]
when people live free of government coercion and control. In America,
individuals can practice any faith or no faith. This is true religious
freedom--having the freedom to practice a faith or to have no faith at
all and to have that choice not only be respected, but protected.
Respecting and protecting this fundamental human right means that we
cannot diminish it. The constitutional guarantee of the free exercise
of religion means that people have a right to live their faith in
public. Saying someone has the right to worship freely at the place of
their choosing is not the same thing. Additionally, while one faith
group should not be favored over another, so too should we not err on
the side of removing faith from the public sphere and opting for no
religion at all.
Thomas Jefferson left explicit instructions that his authorship of
the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom be included on his
gravestone as one of only three things for which he wanted ``most to be
remembered.''
As we celebrate the 230th anniversary of the passage of this statute,
what will we be most remembered for? I hope that we can be remembered
for not only honoring this legacy of Thomas Jefferson, but for
upholding a right that is fundamental to the core of this nation and to
human dignity--religious freedom.
