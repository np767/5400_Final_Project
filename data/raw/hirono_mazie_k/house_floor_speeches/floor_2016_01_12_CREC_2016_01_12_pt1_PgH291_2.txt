E-FREE ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for 5 minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to tell the story of Sabrina
Fregoso of Diamond Springs, California. Sabrina is one of the tens of
thousands of women harmed by the permanent sterilization device Essure.
In August of 2012, Sabrina welcomed her fourth child, at which time
she discussed permanent sterilization with her physician. Her doctor
recommended Essure and assured her that the procedure was safe.
Immediately following the Essure procedure, Sabrina began to notice a
consistent and substantial decline in her health, including losing
control of her bowels, extensive weight gain, severe bloating, hair
loss, and sores covering her body. Her lower back, hips, and leg joints
became painful. She experienced numbness in her feet and sharp heel
pain that made it difficult to walk.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise again as their voice to tell this Chamber
that their stories are real, their pain is real, and their fight is
real.
My bill, the E-Free Act, can halt this tragedy by removing this
dangerous device from the market. I urge my colleagues to join in this
fight because stories like Sabrina's are too important to ignore.
