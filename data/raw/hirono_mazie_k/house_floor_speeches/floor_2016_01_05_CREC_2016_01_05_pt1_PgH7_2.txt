E-FREE ACT
(Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to tell the story of
Amanda Dykeman of Illinois, one of the tens of thousands of women
permanently harmed by the sterilization device known as Essure.
After Amanda had the device implanted in 2010 at the age of 28, her
hair began to fall out, she felt great fatigue, continuously fought
urinary tract and kidney infections, and would suffer from severe
abdominal and joint pain. She suffered with so much pain that she would
contemplate suicide. Her symptoms subsided after a total hysterectomy
in 2013, but, physically, she knows that the device left her
permanently damaged.
I rise as a voice for the Essure Sisters, who number in the
thousands, to tell this Chamber that their stories are real, their pain
is real, and their fight is real.
Mr. Speaker, my bill, the E-Free Act, can halt this tragedy by
removing this dangerous device from the market. I urge my colleagues to
join in this fight because stories like Amanda's are too important to
ignore.
