General Leave
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and
add extraneous material on H.R. 3234, as amended.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the
gentleman from Louisiana?
There was no objection.
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3234, as amended, the
Department of Veterans Affairs VA Medical Center Recovery Act.
This bill would require the VA to publish key health metrics and use
these metrics to determine semiannually which VA medical centers are
performing satisfactorily and which are underperforming.
If a VA medical center is determined to be underperforming, VA would
be required to send a rapid deployment team to the facility within 30
days to establish a remediation plan and provide needed help in problem
areas.
The VA would also be required to send regular reports to Congress on
which facilities are underperforming and what actions have been taken
to improve their performance.
In addition, the bill would require the VA inspector general to
prioritize investigations related to underperforming medical centers
and the Office of Accountability Review to prioritize investigations of
whistleblower retaliation relating to underperforming medical centers.
This bill would also include a provision to strengthen training for
undergraduate nurses on veterans unique issues, needs, and benefits.
H.R. 3234, as amended, is sponsored by Congresswoman Martha Roby from
Alabama, and I am grateful for her leadership in introducing this
legislation.
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby).
Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask my colleagues to support H.R.
3234, the VA Medical Center Recovery Act.
This bill puts the responsibility for identifying and improving the
worst performing VA medical centers squarely on the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs, requiring him to deploy teams of experts to turn
around failing facilities.
The bill would, for the first time, require the VA to publish key
metrics known as SAIL data on the Federal Register and would require
the Secretary to report to Congress any medical centers determined to
be failing.
Some of my colleagues might wonder why such a bill is necessary,
given the VA reform law that we passed more than a year ago. That was a
good bill, but it wasn't a silver bullet. Many problems still exist in
the VA, and it is our responsibility to address them.
Mr. Speaker, the Central Alabama VA in my district became known as
one of the worst in the country. My staff and I worked with
whistleblowers and the press to uncover major instances of misconduct,
negligence, and mismanagement inside the Central Alabama VA, including:
Widespread manipulation of scheduling data. A nation-leading 57
percent of employees reported that managers instructed them to change
appointment times to hide long waits.
More than 1,000 patient X-rays, some showing malignancies, went
missing for months and even years.
A pulmonologist was caught twice falsifying more than 1,200 patient
records but somehow given a satisfactory review.
An employee took a recovering veteran to a crackhouse, bought him
drugs, and paid for prostitutes, all to extort his benefits. When
caught, the employee wasn't fired, not until a year later, after our
office exposed it publicly.
In the wake of these exposures, the Central Alabama VA Director
became the first senior VA manager fired under the new law.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 3 minutes.
Mrs. ROBY. But even after leadership changes, data showed that the
Central Alabama VA's two medical centers in Montgomery and Tuskegee
were ranked the worst and the second worst in the Nation for delays in
patient care.
By any measure, the Central Alabama VA was the definition of a
failing VA system. We had a severe problem, and it required immediate
attention.
But, Mr. Speaker, getting the attention of the top VA leaders proved
difficult. Once our problems left the front page, there wasn't a whole
lot of followup.
My veterans in Alabama were subject to some of the worst healthcare
service in the country, and no one wanted to take responsibility.
Mr. Speaker, I began to think maybe it was because we were depending
on a broken bureaucracy to fix itself, that maybe it was because we
were asking VA leaders, rather than requiring them, to intervene.
Mr. Speaker, I decided that it was time that we changed that. So, in
July, I filed that legislation and began working with the Veterans'
Affairs Committee to get a hearing and a vote.
I don't sit on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, so I want to thank
the chairman, Jeff Miller; the subcommittee chairman, Dan Benishek; and
all the members of the committee for being receptive and working with
me on this bill.
I also want to thank all the committee staff for their hard work.
There is no question this bill represents a major step forward and a
foundation to build upon.
It should be noted that almost 2 years after the scandal first broke,
we are making progress in central Alabama at the VA. Staffing is up,
wait times are down. We are building a Community Veterans Health
Network that I believe one day can be an example for the entire Nation.
We have a long way to go, and I am truly optimistic about the future.
But, Mr. Speaker, it shouldn't have taken this long and it shouldn't
have taken a Member of Congress breathing down the necks of top VA
officials to get the attention that our veterans deserve.
You know, sometimes I wonder what would have happened if our
courageous whistleblowers hadn't stepped up or if the reporters we
worked with didn't think it was a story?
What if the truth about the missing X-rays, the manipulated
pulmonology records, and the crackhouse never came out? What if we want
exposed all of that?
Would our veterans in central Alabama still be subject to the worst
health care in the country? Would we even know?
I don't want what happened in central Alabama to ever happen again
anywhere. This bill helps to ensure that by requiring key VA health
metrics to be published for everyone to see and making sure that the VA
officials at the very top cannot hide behind the layers of bureaucracy
when it comes to severely failing centers.
Again, I ask my colleagues to support this bill.
{time}  1630
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, this legislation, H.R. 3234, as amended, is designed to
establish criteria for the evaluation and improvement of VA medical
centers. The
[[Page H630]]
bill requires the VA to create key health metrics to measure whether
each medical center is satisfactory or underperforming.
The metrics will be published on the VA Web site, and an
underperforming medical center will be subject to a rapid deployment
team being sent to the facility to create a remediation plan and bring
them up to standards. The VA will issue quarterly reports on the
underperforming facilities and their progress in the following
remediation plan.
Additionally, the bill seeks to require the VA to enter into
partnerships with recognized schools of nursing to provide
undergraduate nursing students enrolled in such schools with
standardized training. The bill lists the 11 areas the training should
involve, including PTSD, TBI, and military sexual trauma.
Mr. Speaker, this bill addresses issues the committee has expressed
concerns about in the past. I support its passage.
Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 3234, as amended.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I also once again encourage all Members to
support H.R. 3234, as amended.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3234,
the Failing VA Medical Center Recovery Act.
I support this legislation because it would establish in the
Department of Veterans Affairs an Office of Failing Medical Center
Recovery, and the position of Under Secretary for Failing Medical
Center Recovery to head the Office.
The Office shall carry out the managerial and day-to-day operational
control of each VA failing medical center.
The bill directs that the VA shall: publish in the Federal Register
and on a publicly available VA website a compilation of key health
metrics for each VA medical center; certify semiannually that each VA
medical center ranked as ``failing'' is subject to managerial and day-
to-day operational control by the Office; revoke the certification of a
VA medical center as a failing medical center if it achieves a ranking
of ``satisfactory'' or better for three consecutive fiscal quarters;
submit to Congress a quarterly report on the Office, including actions
taken by the Under Secretary regarding covered failing medical centers;
and transfer each covered failing medical center from the direct
control of the relevant Veterans Integrated Service Network to the
direct control of the Under Secretary.
The bill also ensures that the Inspector General of the VA will
prioritize investigations relating to covered failing medical centers,
and the Office of Accountability Review will prioritize investigations
of whistle blower retaliation relating to such centers.
Mr. Speaker, the reason this important legislation is needed is
illustrated by the tragic and heart breaking cases of thousands of
veterans who were left waiting for care for serious medical conditions.
In the State of Texas we have 1,099,141 Veterans under the age of 65
and 590,618 who are over the age of 65. There are over 1,689,759
veterans living in our state.
The 18th Congressional District has 20,607 under age 65 and 9,844
Veterans over the age of 65.
The Michael E. Debakey Veterans Hospital Center, located in Houston
Texas serves the health care needs of thousands of veterans and their
families.
The Debakey Veterans Hospital Center provides support to veterans and
their families who are amputees, cancer, spinal cord injuries,
traumatic brain injury, and have visual impairments.
The Medical center provides family support services through its
Fisher House that provides living suites at no cost to family members
of hospitalized Veterans and military members.
Today, with our vote on H.R. 3234, we can renew our commitment to our
nation's more than 2 million troops and reservists, their families, and
the 22 million veterans who served our nation.
I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 3234.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 3234, as amended.
The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend
title 38, United States Code, to direct the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs to evaluate the ability of each medical center of the
Department to provide quality health care to veterans, to ensure that
the Secretary improves such medical centers that are underperforming,
and for other purposes.''.
A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
