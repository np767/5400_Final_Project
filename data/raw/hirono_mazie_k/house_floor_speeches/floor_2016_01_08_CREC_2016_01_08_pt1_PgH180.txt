HONORING DR. GREGORY EASTWOOD
(Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished
career of Dr. Gregory Eastwood.
I am incredibly privileged to be joined here today by Dr. Eastwood
and his wonderful family.
Celebrated throughout our entire region for his commitment to
service, Dr. Eastwood first served as president of the State University
of New York Upstate Medical University from 1993 until 2006--the
longest in the history of the institution and of all sitting presidents
on SUNY campuses. Dr. Eastwood returned to the president's seat in
October 2013 when the campus was in dire need of his capable
leadership.
Dr. Eastwood has served our community for years with distinction,
holding leadership roles and partnering with many different
organizations in the region.
He advanced an aggressive vision for the SUNY Upstate, which has
grown under his leadership through the establishment of the University
Health Care Center, the Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Golisano
Children's Hospital.
A clinician, scholar, educator, community leader, and author, Dr.
Eastwood has had a remarkable career.
Today, I want to thank Dr. Eastwood for his excellence,
professionalism, caring presence, and commitment to the SUNY University
and to central New York.
Our community is stronger now because of your work, Dr. Eastwood. We
will sorely miss you.
