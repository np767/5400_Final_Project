CAREER-READY STUDENT VETERANS ACT
Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and
pass the bill (H.R. 2360) to amend title 38, United States Code, to
improve the approval of certain programs of education for purposes of
educational assistance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs,
as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 2360
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ``Career-Ready Student
Veterans Act''.
SEC. 2. APPROVAL OF COURSES FOR PURPOSES OF EDUCATIONAL
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY SECRETARY
OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.
(a) Approval of Non-Accredited Courses.--Subsection (c) of

program meets any instructional curriculum licensure or
certification requirements of such State.
``(15) In the case of a program designed to prepare an

at the end the following new subsection:
``(f)(1) The Secretary may waive the requirements of

Education.
``(B) The program did not meet the requirements of such
paragraph at any time during the two-year period preceding

regarding the award of student financial assistance, except
for the recruitment of foreign students residing in foreign
countries who are not eligible to receive Federal student

regularly scheduled breaks between courses, semesters or
terms) at that institution, any course so pursued by the
individual at that institution while so continuously enrolled
shall not be subject to disapproval by reason of such
amendment.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each
will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
General Leave
Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all
Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and
to include any extraneous material they may have on H.R. 2360, as
amended, in the Record.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the
gentleman from Florida?
There was no objection.
Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
The post-9/11 GI Bill provides student veterans with a wonderful
opportunity to educate themselves for a job in the new economy.
Thousands of training programs and schools have been approved for use
of this program, which has benefited millions of veterans.
Unfortunately, there are some schools that are not simply providing
quality education or training that sufficiently prepares students for
jobs in their field of study.
[[Page H615]]
The committee has found that, in some cases, students have been
caught in a situation where the school they attended is properly
accredited, but the program they are using at the school is not. This
has led to situations where students have completed a training or a
degree program only to find out that this training does not qualify
them to receive the necessary credentials or take the necessary tests
to practice in the career field for which they used their benefits.
This was clearly not the intention of the GI Bill, and I am glad that
this bill would ensure that in order to be eligible for GI Bill
benefits, an accredited or nonaccredited program must meet State
accreditation, licensure, or certification standards. This requirement
would not only protect student veterans but would also protect the
integrity of the GI Bill for future generations.
I want to thank Chairman Wenstrup of our Subcommittee on Economic
Opportunity and the author of the bill, Ranking Member Takano, for
their work on this legislation, which has my full support.
I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2306, as amended.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
I rise today in support of H.R. 2360, the Career-Ready Student
Veterans Act. Mr. Speaker, I do so for two important reasons.
{time}  1545
The first is that it protects veterans using their GI Bill benefits
by requiring that all career education programs meet proper
accreditation, licensure, and certification requirements in order to be
eligible for the GI Bill.
The second reason I am so happy to support H.R. 2360 is that it
represents the very best of the legislative process. It is the product
of collaboration between the majority and the minority, but it is also
a collaboration between Congress and the VSO and academic communities.
I want to give due credit to the bill's original author, Subcommittee
on Economic Opportunity Ranking Member Mark Takano, and Chairman
Wenstrup and his staff for working so hard to ensure that the bill
meets its goal of preparing student veterans for their chosen fields of
study.
The Career-Ready Student Veterans Act puts in place a protection for
student veterans which already exists for servicemen who use the
Department of Defense tuition assistance benefits.
I am pleased that the bill creates this basic fairness and ensures
that the GI Bill benefits help veterans earn credit that will lead to
meaningful employment.
In addition to ensuring that career-education programs meet proper
accreditation requirements, the bill also requires that they publicly
disclose any additional steps that the student veteran needs to take to
prepare them for entry into their chosen profession.
I understand this legislation has passed out of committee in the
Senate and enjoys bipartisan support there. Again, I want to
congratulate the bill's original authors on this side and offer my
strong support.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Phoenixville, Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).
Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support
H.R. 2360, the Career-Ready Student Veterans Act, a straightforward
solution that will ensure that career education programs set our
veterans on the proper path to their desired employment.
As a proud member of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity and a
cosponsor of this legislation, H.R. 2360 would ensure that GI Bill-
eligible career education programs provide our veterans with the
accreditation and credentials they need to build a career in the
professional field or specialty of their choosing.
This bill requires that career-education programs that accept GI Bill
tuition payments must have programmatic accreditation if accreditation
is required for employment in the career for which the program is
designed to prepare its students.
The bill also requires that career-education programs designed to
prepare an individual for licensure or certification in a State must
meet the curriculum and instructional requirements set by the State for
licensure or certification.
Mr. Speaker, if our veterans invest their time and effort to learn a
skill set, they will have the peace of mind to know they are on the
right career-education path and the confidence to know that, if they
work hard, they will receive the appropriate certification they need to
start their desired employment.
Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Mr. Takano for his leadership on
this legislation.
I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.
Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman
from California (Mr. Takano).
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan
legislation, H.R. 2360, the Career-Ready Student Veterans Act. This
bill will ensure that our veterans are using their post-9/11 GI
benefits at career-education programs that actually do what they say
they do: prepare students for entry into a specific career field.
My legislation would require that, in order to be eligible to receive
GI Bill benefits, programs have programmatic accreditation, if required
by the State for employment in a specific field.
Programs also must prepare students for licensure or certification in
a field, if required by the State, and they must meet any State-
mandated curricular or instructional requirements.
This closely mirrors language included in the fiscal year 2014
National Defense Authorization Act in relation to military tuition
assistance.
We all know the importance of a good job in helping veterans
successfully transition out of service and into civilian life.
Education and training is often a necessary part of finding that job.
Unfortunately, too many veterans waste their time and hard-earned
education benefits at career-education programs that don't actually
prepare them for that career field. For example, most States require
prospective lawyers to have graduated from a law program accredited by
the American Bar Association in order to sit for the bar exam.
As we all know, you must pass the bar to practice law. When veterans
unwittingly spend their GI Bill benefits at law programs not accredited
by the ABA, they graduate with no prospects of becoming a lawyer in
most States. My legislation will make sure that this no longer happens.
I thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member Brown as well as Chairman
Wenstrup and my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for their
support.
I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of the Career-Ready Student
Veterans Act.
Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support
H.R. 2360.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers at
this time. I, too, urge a ``yea'' vote on H.R. 2360, as amended.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House
Committee on Homeland Security and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary
Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and
Investigations, I rise in support of H.R. 2360, the ``Career-Ready
Student Veterans Act of 2015.''
This bill encourages new criteria for state approval of applications
by educational institutions providing veterans with non-accredited
courses.
H.R. 2360 respects the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
educational assistance, provides specific instructions for when the VA
can waive requirements by the bill, and instructs the VA to submit to
Congress notice of, and justification for, a waiver within 30 days of
issuance.
The bill clarifies specific circumstances for when the VA shall
disapprove a course of education and when a course shall not be subject
to disapproval by reason of this Act.
Specifically, H.R. 2360 achieves these goals by:
1. Requiring programs designed to prepare individuals for state
licensure or certification to fulfill any state instructional
curriculum licensure or certification requirements
[[Page H616]]
2. Providing conditions for the Department of Veterans Affairs to
refer to when waiving requirements or disapproving a course of
education
Finally, H.R. 2360 facilitates the approval of certain programs of
education for the purposes of enhancing educational assistance provided
by the Department of Veteran Affairs.
I am pleased that H.R. 2360 aligns with the significance of
legislation I have introduced in the past.
I introduced H.R. 76, Helping to Encourage Real Opportunity for
Veterans Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace Act Of 2015. This
bill also enhanced the educational options for veterans by focusing on
the necessity to establish opportunities that facilitate the transition
for veterans from the hostile armed force environment to school or
workplace.
I introduced H.R. 78, New Chance for a New Start in Life Act of 2015.
This bill addresses financial awareness pertaining to grants, and
employment training programs to assist long-term unemployed persons to
re-enter the workforce in areas projected to have the highest rates of
demand.
Pertaining to educational institutions providing veterans with non-
accredited courses, enforcement of the criteria for state approval of
applications allows veterans to benefit from the improvement of the
approval process.
H.R. 2360 is the first step toward enforcing this implementation
strategy and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the
``Career-Ready Student Veterans Act of 2015.''
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 2360, as amended.
The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
