REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I have voted over 60 times to repeal or to
replace all or portions of ObamaCare. I have voted numerous times to
defund Planned Parenthood.
These issues have always been held up by the parliamentary rules in
the Senate, which is the ability of a minority number of Senators to
block bills from coming to the floor. But not now, not today. Under
reconciliation procedures, a simple majority vote can move a bill out
of the Senate Chamber.
So today we will vote to repeal and replace major pieces of ObamaCare
that distort the market, raise prices, and deprive our citizens of
choice. The bill today will eliminate the individual mandate and the
employer mandate. The government's forcing of our citizens to buy a
product that they do not want is un-American and costly. I say good
riddance.
We were all aghast over the recordings that were released that
highlighted Planned Parenthood's selling of baby body parts. As a
Member who believes that individual, distinct life begins at
conception, Planned Parenthood's lack of remorse or even of concern
highlights its dark business. Today we send a bill to the President's
desk to defund Planned Parenthood.
Many of my constituents have told me: We gave you the House majority
in 2010. What have you done? We gave you the Senate majority in 2014.
What have you done? Why can't you get something to the President's
desk?
Today we do. We send a bill to the President's desk that repeals
ObamaCare and defunds Planned Parenthood, and it is about time.
