MAUI COUNTY HOUSING PLAN
(Ms. TOKUDA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, for so many of our Maui `` 'ohana,''
``family,'' stable housing for their families and the ability to manage
mortgages for lost homes keep them up at night.
Earlier this month, the State of Hawaii, Maui County, FEMA, and
various philanthropic organizations announced a $500 million interim
housing plan to move thousands of families still living in hotels into
stable, long-term housing by July 1 of this year. $250 million of this
critical funding is coming directly from FEMA.
Of all the ways that this plan will seek to provide some stability
for ``keikis,'' ``children,'' and ``kupuna,'' ``elders,'' who lost
everything, the most critical and urgent are the investments that will
be made in more permanent developments.
We need shovels in the ground now, and I strongly encourage FEMA to
lean into their plans to build modular homes that will house up to 500
households.
In talking with constituents and Maui Mayor Bissen, we must also
focus immediately on identifying options to help survivors with their
mortgages. Absent options, our people will feel they have no choice but
to leave Lahaina. As I have said before, Lahaina is not Lahaina without
her people.
