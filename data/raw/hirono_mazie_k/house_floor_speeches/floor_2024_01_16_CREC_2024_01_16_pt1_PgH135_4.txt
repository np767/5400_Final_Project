EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL FOR HOUSING
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, this is a picture of 3-year-old Jose
Urribarri, who is a member of a migrant family in Chicago. Freezing
weather is just one of the challenges facing families like Jose's as
stable housing options disappear in the dead of winter.
Catholic Charities of Chicago is one of our local agencies leading
the way and moving families from police station floors into better
accommodations, but Catholic Charities cannot do it alone. Scarce local
resources mean that Congress needs to step up, as well.
Let's pass emergency supplemental funding for cities and bring some
hope to those like Jose who need it badly right now.
