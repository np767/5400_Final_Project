HONORING EDWARD ROBB ``TED'' BARRETT
(Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of Edward
Robb ``Ted'' Barrett.
Ted was born on September 14, 1991, and passed away on January 30,
2016--far, far too early. Ted was a loving son, a brother to six, and a
loyal friend to countless more in our community. Ted had a unique
ability to light up any room he entered. His lighthearted, joyful
spirit uplifted everyone he met.
A graduate of Christian Brothers Academy in Syracuse, of Deerfield
Academy in Massachusetts, and of Hamilton College, Ted thrived as an
athlete and always looked for ways to give back to those less
fortunate. He had a passion and a deep admiration for America's heroes
and valued Team Red, White, and Blue's great work in enriching the
lives of veterans in need.
I had the great privilege of knowing Ted personally and was inspired
by his kindness, his humor, and his love for his family and country.
Ted will always be remembered as an honorable young man who touched
many lives, having a lasting positive impact on all who knew and loved
him.
May his name forever be remembered in the Congressional Record and in
the great United States of America.
