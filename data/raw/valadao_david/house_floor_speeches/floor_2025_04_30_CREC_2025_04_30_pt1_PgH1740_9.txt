HONORING MASTER SERGEANT DAVID NORMAN
(Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Master Sergeant
David Norman of Troy, Ohio.
Today marks the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon. David Norman
was one of the brave servicemen who evacuated over 7,000 Americans and
allies from the United States Embassy in 1975.
During the withdrawal from Vietnam, Sergeant Norman was one of the 11
brave marines who defended the U.S. Embassy during the 19-hour
evacuation.
Many Americans were successfully evacuated by helicopter, but those
remaining stranded on the roof of the embassy, including David, had
resolved to defend their positions as long as their ammunition lasted.
A U.S. pilot flying over the embassy at low altitude spotted these
servicemen stranded and made a rescue flight under fire, and all 11 men
made it home alive.
David retired from the Marine Corps after 30 years of service before
returning to Ohio, and then he spent 26 years with the Miami County
Sheriff's Department. He was recently elected as the Miami County
Recorder.
I rise today to commend David's patriotic service to our Nation and
to commemorate this solemn anniversary. Let us never forget the bravery
of our troops.
