MARKET DATA PROTECTION
(Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, the Consolidated Audit Trail stands as the
largest financial database in the world and ranks second in size only
to the NSA's database.
The value of the sensitive information housed within this database
includes Social Security numbers, broker numbers, account numbers. In
fact, it is comparable to nine times the wealth that is in Fort Knox--
far more sensitive than the Equifax data, whose breach affects 143
million Americans.
Despite the enormity of wealth within this database, the unfortunate
reality is that its cybersecurity is not yet adequate. The Government
Accountability Office report found the SEC's systems ``at unnecessary
risk of compromise.'' The CAT operator recently delayed the issuing of
technical specifications, which means that industry will have just 1
month to transmit all of this market data.
Mr. Speaker, I introduced the Market Data Protection Act, which
passed this House with unanimous support, to guarantee the private
information of hundreds of millions of Americans transmits securely and
without risk. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate
to send this bill to the President's desk.
