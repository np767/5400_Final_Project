``(A) In general.--Any blockchain system that relates to a
digital commodity for which a certification has been made
under paragraph (1) shall be considered a mature blockchain
system 60 days after the date on which the Commission
receives a certification under paragraph (1), unless the
Commission notifies the person who made the certification
within such time that the Commission is staying the
certification due to--
``(i) an inadequate explanation by the person making the
certification; or
``(ii) any novel or complex issues which require additional
time to consider.
``(B) Public notice.--The Commission shall make the
following available to the public and provide a copy to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission:
``(i) Each certification received under paragraph (1).
``(ii) Each stay of the Commission under this subsection,
and the reasons therefor.
``(iii) Any response from a person making a certification
under paragraph (1) to a stay of the certification by the

``(B) Review.--In an appeal under subparagraph (A), the
court shall have de novo review of the determination to rebut
the certification.
``(b) Maturity Criteria.--
``(1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of the Congress
that protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and
efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation
necessitates establishing clear criteria for blockchain
systems to be deemed mature, as well as enabling the
Commission to develop, without prejudice to any such criteria
codified in statute, alternative criteria by which blockchain
systems may be considered not to be controlled by any person
or group of persons under common control in order to
accommodate changes in markets and technology.
``(2) In general.--The Commission may issue rules
identifying conditions by which a blockchain system, together
with its related digital commodity, shall be considered a
mature blockchain system, consistent with the protection of
investors, maintenance of fair, orderly, and efficient
markets, and the facilitation of capital formation.
``(3) Rules of construction.--
``(A) Nothing in this subsection may be construed to permit
the Commission to impose additional criteria to the criteria
in subsection (c) for certifying that a blockchain system is
a mature blockchain system pursuant to subsection (c).
``(B) Nothing in this subsection or subsection (c) may be
construed to limit the Commission's ability to identify
alternative conditions and criteria by which a blockchain
system may be considered a mature blockchain system.
``(c) Deemed Mature.--
``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (b), for the
purposes of subsection (a), a digital commodity issuer,
digital commodity related person, digital commodity
affiliated person, or decentralized governance system of the
blockchain system may establish that a blockchain system,
together with its related digital commodity, is not
controlled by any person or group of persons under common
control, if the blockchain system, together with its related
digital asset, meets the requirements described in paragraph
(2) or (3).
``(2) Criteria for any blockchain system.--The requirements
described in this paragraph are the following:
``(A) System value.--
``(i) Market value.--The digital commodity has a value that
is substantially derived from the use and functioning of the
blockchain system.
``(ii) Development of value mechanism substantially
completed.--Where the digital commodity issuer has made
public a development plan describing how the digital
commodity's value is reasonably expected to be derived from
the programmatic functioning of the blockchain system, the
development of such mechanisms has been substantially
completed.
``(B) Functional system.--The blockchain system allows
network participants to engage in the activities the
blockchain system is intended to provide, including--
``(i) using, transmitting, or storing value, or otherwise
executing transactions, on the blockchain system;
``(ii) deploying, executing, or accessing software or
services, or otherwise offering or participating in services,
deployed on or integrated with the blockchain system;
``(iii) participating in the consensus mechanism,
transaction validation process, or decentralized governance
system of the blockchain system; or
``(iv) operating any client, node, validator, or other form
of computational infrastructure with respect to the
blockchain system.
``(C) Open and interoperable system.--The blockchain
system--
``(i) is composed of source code that is open source; and
``(ii) does not restrict or prohibit based on the exercise
of unilateral authority any person, other than a digital
commodity issuer, digital commodity related person, or
digital commodity affiliated person from engaging in the
activities the blockchain system is intended to provide,
including the activities described in subparagraph (B).
[[Page H3383]]
``(D) Programmatic system.--The blockchain system operates,
executes, and enforces its operations and transactions based
solely on pre-established, transparent rules encoded directly
within the source code of the blockchain system.
``(E) System governance.--No person or group of persons
under common control--
``(i) has the unilateral authority, directly or indirectly,
through any contract, arrangement, understanding,
relationship, or otherwise, to control or materially alter
the functionality, operation, or rules of consensus or
agreement of the blockchain system or its related digital
commodity; or
``(ii) has the unilateral authority to direct the voting,
in the aggregate, of 20 percent or more of the outstanding
voting power of such blockchain system by means of a related
digital commodity, nodes or validators, a decentralized
governance system, or otherwise, in a blockchain system which
can be altered by a voting system.
``(F) Impartial system.--No person or group of persons
under common control possesses a unique permission or
privilege with respect to functionality, operation, or rules
of consensus or agreement of the blockchain system or its
related digital commodity, unless such alteration--
``(i) addresses errors, regular maintenance, or
cybersecurity risks of the blockchain system that affect the
programmatic functioning of the blockchain system; and
``(ii) is adopted through the consensus or agreement of a
decentralized governance system.
``(G) Distributed ownership.--No digital commodity issuer,
digital commodity related person, or digital commodity
affiliated person beneficially owns, in the aggregate, 20
percent or more of the total amount of units of the digital
commodity.
``(3) Optional criteria for preexisting blockchain
systems.--The requirements described in this paragraph are
that the blockchain system--
``(A) was created prior to the date of enactment of this
section;
``(B) met the requirements of subparagraphs (A) through (F)
of paragraph (2) prior to the date of enactment of this
section; and
``(C) at least 50 percent of the units of the digital
commodity related to the blockchain system are held by
persons other than the digital commodity issuer, a digital
commodity related person, or a digital commodity affiliated
person.
``(d) Decentralized Governance System.--
``(1) For the purposes of this section, a decentralized
governance system is not a `person' or a `group of persons
under common control'.
``(2) A blockchain system, together with its digital
commodity, shall not be precluded from being considered a
mature blockchain system solely based on a functional,
administrative, clerical, or ministerial action of a
decentralized governance system, including any such action
taken by a person acting on behalf of and at the direction of
the decentralized governance system, as determined by the
Commission and consistent with the protection of investors,
maintenance of fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and the
facilitation of capital formation.
``(e) Rulemaking.--Not more than 270 days after the date of
enactment of this section, the Commission shall issue rules
to carry out this section.''.
SEC. 206. EFFECTIVE DATE.
Unless otherwise provided in this title, this title and the

this next generation of the internet.
(2) Digital commodity networks represent a new way for
people to join together and cooperate with one another to
undertake certain activities.

foundational building blocks of these systems, aligning the
economic incentive for individuals to cooperate with one
another to achieve a common purpose.
(4) The digital commodity ecosystem has the potential to
grow our economy and improve everyday lives of Americans by
facilitating collaboration through the use of technology to
manage activities, allocate resources, and facilitate
decision making.
(5) Blockchain systems and the digital commodities they
empower provide control, enhance transparency, reduce
transaction costs, and increase efficiency if proper
protections are put in place for investors, consumers, our
financial system, and our national security.
(6) Blockchain technology facilitates new types of network
participation which businesses in the United States may
utilize in innovative ways.
(7) Other digital commodity companies are setting up their
operations outside of the United
[[Page H3394]]
States, where countries are establishing frameworks to
embrace the potential of blockchain technology and digital
commodities and provide safeguards for consumers.
(8) Digital commodities, despite the purported anonymity,
provide law enforcement with an exceptional tracing tool to
identify illicit activity and bring criminals to justice.
(9) The Financial Services Committee of the House of
Representatives has held multiple hearings highlighting
various risks that digital commodities can pose to the
financial markets, consumers, and investors that must be
addressed as we seek to harness the benefits of these
innovations.
(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
(1) the United States should seek to prioritize
understanding the potential opportunities of the next
generation of the internet;
(2) the United States should seek to foster advances in
technology that have robust evidence indicating they can
improve our financial system and create more fair and
equitable access to financial services for everyday Americans
while protecting our financial system, investors, and
consumers;
(3) the United States must support the responsible
development of digital commodities and the underlying
technology in the United States or risk the shifting of the
development of such assets and technology outside of the
United States, to less regulated countries;
(4) Congress should consult with public and private sector
stakeholders to understand how to enact a functional
framework tailored to the specific risks and unique benefits
of different digital commodity-related activities,
distributed ledger technology, distributed networks, and
mature blockchain systems;
(5) Congress should enact a functional framework tailored
to the specific risks of different digital commodity-related
activities and unique benefits of distributed ledger
technology, distributed networks, and mature blockchain
systems; and
(6) consumers and market participants will benefit from a
framework for digital commodities consistent with
longstanding investor protections in securities and
commodities markets, yet tailored to the unique benefits and
risks of the digital commodity ecosystem.

General Leave
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their
remarks and include extraneous material on this bill in the Record.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the
gentleman from Arkansas?
There was no objection.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
I rise in strong support this morning of the CLARITY Act. We have
been here before, Mr. Speaker. Just last year, we passed landmark
legislation, FIT21, with an overwhelming bipartisan majority to apply
strong Federal standards to digital asset markets.
For more than 5 years, our committee has heard from dozens and dozens
of experts, held numerous roundtables and hearings with market
participants of all sizes in all segments of the market to learn more
about the emerging digital asset ecosystem.
We learned about the value proposition and relevant risks associated
with digital assets and the use of blockchain technology. We have heard
time and time again from market participants and regulators about the
need for clear regulatory guardrails.
We have talked about the need to fill those regulatory gaps that have
left millions participating in crypto markets vulnerable. In fact, Mr.
Speaker, both President Biden in his Executive Order 14067, and
President Trump in his Executive Order 14178, identified those market
regulatory gaps, asking Congress to act to fill those gaps.
In 2022, we certainly witnessed consumer harm when the Financial
Services Committee heard unprecedented testimony from an expert called
in to clean up the failed digital asset crypto firm FTX and the mess it
left behind. In his words, never had he seen such an utter failure in
corporate controls.
In its wake, then-Chairwoman Waters wisely stated: ``We need
legislative action to ensure that digital assets entities cannot
operate in the shadows outside of robust Federal oversight and clear
rules of the road.''
If we needed actions then, we certainly need it now. We risk history
repeating itself, and that is why we gather today on the House floor.
After years of bipartisan work and numerous iterations, this bill
would apply rigorous rules to digital asset firms, prohibiting
commingling of customer funds, and requiring capital recordkeeping and
conflict of interest mitigation standards.
Importantly, the bill recognizes that decentralized finance, or DeFi,
developers do not take custody of user assets nor do they control user
assets. Therefore, we should not treat them in the same way that we
treat centralized actors who do have custody and who do have control
over assets.
It is important to note that in an Agriculture Committee hearing, the
former general counsel of FTX USA himself testified: Had we the
regulatory structure provided for in CLARITY applied to FTX, its
story--and he goes on to say--would almost certainly have had a much
different ending.
Let's ensure that we learn from the past, Mr. Speaker, the digital
asset ecosystem is evolving at a remarkable pace, enabling real-time
settlement of peer-to-peer transactions, initiating a renaissance in
applied cryptography and laying the groundwork for the next generation
of the internet.
The United States has long had the most innovative financial and
technology sectors and the deepest and most liquid capital markets, but
while other jurisdictions are building frameworks for the future of
finance to be on-chain and digitally native, our great country, with
those great characteristics, is lagging.
For too long our digital asset regime has been the worst of both
worlds: regulation by enforcement, which has pushed good actors to
leave the United States, and the regulatory gaps that I talked about
identified in both President Biden and President Trump's executive
orders that have left consumers unprotected from the bad actors.
Now, today, we have an opportunity to reverse course and reestablish
the United States as the global hub for digital innovation. To do so,
we must close the regulatory gaps with commonsense rules.
{time}  0930
Mr. Speaker, the CLARITY Act does just that by leveraging the
expertise of our two market regulators, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to ensure
wraparound oversight of digital asset markets, from initial sales,
raising capital, to daily trading, it provides clarity for banks
engaging in this ecosystem.
As we said in the last Congress, Mr. Speaker, these rules need to be
fit for purpose for the digital ecosystem. All of us on this House
floor know that the status quo is simply unacceptable. We all know
American consumers and innovators deserve this clarity. They deserve
better. They deserve rules of the road.
The choice before us is whether to lead in the financial markets of
the future or watch the next FTX fail while we are left saying once
again: Well, we have been here before.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me on both sides of the
aisle and support the CLARITY Act. Let's fill these regulatory gaps
with the proper Federal oversight. Let's create a competitive digital
ecosystem. I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, crypto week has been going so well, hasn't it? Mr.
Speaker, that is because bailing out billionaires is hard work.
I look at how hard Republicans worked to strip healthcare from 17
million Americans, shutter rural hospitals, and take food assistance
from 12 million people just to hand the richest 1 percent of Americans
a tax break they don't need. No one should be surprised that the
Republicans' next order of business is a billion-dollar handout to the
President himself.
In just 6 months, President Trump has enriched himself and his family
to the tune of $1.2 billion, and that is just the beginning.
President Trump used to call crypto a scam. In 2021, Trump said:
``Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam . . . I don't like it because it
is another currency competing against the dollar.''
Melania was actually the first to get involved in the crypto
ecosystem. In January 2022, she announced an auction of her non-
fungible token, or NFT, collection. Trump then followed suit in
December 2022, launching his own NFT collection, ditching his concerns
about crypto because he saw it as a way to pad his pockets.
During the campaign trail, Trump ramped up his crypto involvement. In
September 2024, he and his family launched World Liberty Financial, a
crypto trading platform. Days before the Inauguration, Trump launched
his memecoin which he later used to offer access to the White House to
the highest bidder, foreign or domestic.
His family's crypto empire hasn't stopped there. World Liberty
Financial launched a stablecoin called USD1.
[[Page H3398]]
Shortly after that, the Abu Dhabi-backed investment firm, MGX, bought
$2 billion worth of Trump's coin to make an investment in Binance.
Trump's family has also launched a bitcoin mining operation and
multiple crypto exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.
All of this comes at the same time that the Trump administration has
taken away the independence of the financial regulators like the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
He issued Executive Order 14255 which now requires all rules written
by the financial regulators to be reviewed and approved by the White
House budget office. This means this bill would hand over to the
President the ability to write the rules he wants to advance his crypto
operations.
Not only that, under the Trump administration, the SEC has said that
memecoins, stablecoins, and bitcoin mining all do not fall under their
oversight. Can my colleagues imagine that?
Do these assets sound familiar? Oh, yes, they do because these are
all ventures that Trump and his family are pursuing now with no
oversight by Wall Street's cop on the beat--that is the SEC.
Surely, each of my colleagues can see how this is a blatant conflict
of interest. Democrats do. It is why I introduced the Stop Trump and
Crypto Act to ban the President, Vice President, and all the Members of
Congress from crypto corruption.
If we do not ban elected officials, including the President or Vice
President, from this crypto corruption in H.R. 3633, each of us will be
complicit. Yet, even if we included language to stop the crypto con,
this bill, which should be called the calamity act, is bad public
policy. That is plain and simple.
The bill would lead to increased investor harm, plant the seeds for
the next financial crisis, and endanger our national security.
Just last week, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission warned that this bill would allow traditional companies,
like Apple or Google, to evade securities laws. They could walk away
from the disclosure, antifraud, liability, and corporate governance
protections that investors have relied on for 90 years. The bill blocks
our State regulators from protecting seniors against fraud in crypto.
Additionally, the calamity act does not address illicit finance and
other crimes commonly seen in the crypto space. It does not provide
nearly enough direction to agencies, which would be required to match
the level of financial crimes and noncompliance seen in the industry.
It also does not provide sufficient funds for Federal agencies to
examine and enforce these laws.
Mr. Speaker, for all of these reasons, I strongly, strongly oppose
this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO
estimate for this bill.

AA*= between -$500,000 and $500,000.
CBO has not completed an estimate of the effects of the bill on spending subject to appropriation.
Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that the
legislation will be enacted in summer 2025.
Direct spending: The bill would require the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to share information that
it collects from digital commodity exchanges with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Financial Stability
Oversight Council (FSOC), the National Credit Union
Administration (NCUA), and the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (OCC), upon request. The bill also would require
those agencies to regulate additional entities that are
subject to federal anti-money-laundering rules and to issue
regulations that set capital requirements for agreements that
combine multiple financial transactions.
The expenditures of the FDIC, FSOC, NCUA, and OCC are
classified in the budget as direct spending. Both the NCUA
and the OCC collect fees from financial institutions to
offset their operating costs; those fees are recorded in the
budget as offsetting receipts (that is, as reductions in
direct spending). After accounting for fees collected by the
NCUA and OCC, CBO estimates that, on net, enacting H.R. 3633
would increase direct spending for those four agencies by $11
million over the 2025-2035 period.
Revenues: H.R. 3633 would require the CFTC to share
information with the Federal Reserve upon request. The bill
also would direct the Federal Reserve to regulate additional
entities that are subject to federal anti-money-laundering
regulations and to issue rules for the capital requirements
described above. CBO estimates that those activities would
cost the Federal Reserve $7 million over the 2025-2035
period. Costs incurred by the Federal Reserve reduce
remittances, which are recorded in the budget as revenues.
Changes in costs for the Federal Reserve banks have
historically resulted in changes to remittances during the
same year. However, since fiscal year 2023, the central bank
has recorded a deferred asset to account for accrued net
losses from expenses in excess of income. As a result,
remittances largely have been suspended. In CBO's
projections, remittances from the Federal Reserve will
generally be suspended until 2030, and until they resume,
most changes in costs incurred by the system will not be
recorded as changes in remittances.
The FSOC is authorized to assess fees on bank holding
companies and nonbank financial institutions; those fees are
recorded in the budget as revenues. CBO estimates that under
the bill the FSOC would collect $3 million in additional fees
over the 2025-2035 period to cover operating costs.
Finally, section 315 would reduce the size of the Federal
Reserve's surplus fund. CBO estimates that enacting that
provision would increase remittances to the Treasury by $15
million in 2035.
CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 3633 would increase
revenues by $11 million, on net, over the 2025-2035 period.
Spending subject to appropriation: In addition to effects
on direct spending and revenues as noted in the table, the
bill also contains provisions that would affect spending
subject to appropriation. CBO has not estimated those
effects.
Uncertainty: CBO did not estimate any budgetary effects
arising from changes to the banking system or financial
markets as a result of enacting H.R. 3633. Depending on their
individual design and extent of adoption, virtual currencies
could enhance the efficiency of the system, cause disruption,
or reduce bank deposits. Those effects are uncertain and,
given their potential range, CBO cannot currently estimate
their direction or magnitude.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO
estimates that enacting H.R. 3633 would not increase net
direct spending by more than $2.5 billion in any of the four
consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.
CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 3633 would not increase
on-budget deficits by more than $5 billion in any of the four
consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.
Mandates: H.R. 3633 would impose private-sector and
intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded
Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). CBO estimates that the cost of
the mandates would exceed the private- sector threshold but
fall below the intergovernmental threshold established in
UMRA ($206 million and $103 million in 2025, respectively,
adjusted annually for inflation).
Private-Sector mandates: The bill would impose regulatory
requirements on some entities involved in digital commodities
and assets, such as large multinational businesses with
market capitalizations in the hundreds of billions of dollars
and with millions of U.S. consumers. Using publicly available
information and information from industry sources, CBO
estimates that the aggregate cost of the mandate would
greatly exceed the private-sector threshold established in
UMRA.
In addition, if federal financial regulators increase fees
to offset the costs associated
[[Page H3399]]
with implementing the bill, H.R. 3633 would increase the cost
of an existing mandate on private entities required to pay
those assessments. CBO estimates that the annual cost of the
mandate would be in the millions of dollars.
Intergovernmental mandates: The bill would expand existing
preemptions of state laws governing the registration of
digital assets as securities. Although it would limit the
application of state laws, H.R. 3633 would impose no duty on
states that would result in additional spending or loss of
revenue.
Phillip L. Swagel,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil).
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is an essential leader in our committee
and also the chairman of our Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial
Technology, and Artificial Intelligence.
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hill for all of his hard
work on this.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the CLARITY Act. I think two
things are clear. First, the digital asset and blockchain technology
are leading the next wave of financial innovation. We need to make sure
that innovation is occurring here in the United States of America.
Second, under the previous administration, the United States failed
to enact a regulatory framework that is aligned with the realities of
the technology and adequately protects consumers.
Today, the House has an opportunity to meaningfully improve the
status quo that for too long has been marred by uncertainty and
regulatory enforcement. The CLARITY Act establishes a workable,
forward-looking framework. The CLARITY Act provides and ensures that
markets operate with transparency, accountability, and strong consumer
protections.
Today, our laws leave digital asset developers guessing which
regulator has jurisdiction and what compliance even looks like.
{time}  0940
It is not only bad for business. It is bad for consumers and bad for
U.S. competitiveness.
Without action, we will continue to see innovation move overseas to
jurisdictions that are providing the legal clarity that we thus far in
the United States have failed to deliver.
Mr. Speaker, what we want is innovation in developing, not occurring
in boardrooms and law firms in the United States, but in basements and
dorm rooms.
Ensuring the United States leads the Web3 revolution isn't a partisan
issue. It is an American issue.
The CLARITY Act legislates in a thoughtful way in a rapidly evolving
space. The CLARITY Act protects consumers and fosters innovation.
Today, we can lead not by accident but by design. Let's send a
message that America intends to lead in the golden age of digital
assets.
Mr. Speaker, I support the CLARITY Act, and I encourage my colleagues
to vote ``yes.''
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), who is also the ranking member of the
Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial
Intelligence.
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for
her leadership on this issue.
I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3633, the so-called CLARITY Act.
I believe this misguided legislation will have devastating impacts on
our financial stability, national security, and investor protection.
While my Republican friends claim that this bill will regulate crypto
market structure, in reality, it eviscerates the longstanding history
of investor protections that have made our markets the envy of the
world.
Most importantly, this bill, this push for crypto, will not end well
for the U.S. taxpayer. This bill will lead to the next financial
crisis, and the largest crypto donors who wrote this bill will walk
away unharmed because the worst aspect of this bill is that Republicans
have repeatedly refused to include a single amendment preventing a
Federal taxpayer bailout of the crypto industry.
That is what this bill does.
Additionally, this bill includes zero provisions to prevent the
President, who has a $620-million conflict of interest, from continuing
his ability to accept emoluments from foreign governments like Abu
Dhabi.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and protect the
American taxpayer.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), who is our majority whip and who has been
an absolute, essential early focus policymaker in the digital asset
space.
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, the United States stands at the forefront of
the next digital renaissance, a transformative shift toward a
decentralized peer-to-peer digital economy.
For many years, innovators and investors were forced to operate in a
legal gray zone while agencies jostled for regulatory superiority over
the digital asset ecosystem, leaving blockchain developers to pack up
and move abroad.
The CLARITY Act fixes this by creating regulatory guardrails tailored
to the unique attributes of blockchain technology while giving users
and developers the confidence to engage and innovate in this ecosystem.
Gone are the days of arbitrary enforcement actions and regulatory
turf wars that only hindered the development of this groundbreaking
technology and drove capital overseas.
This bill gives market participants the confidence to build, invest,
and grow right here in the United States of America.
We are proud to have the Securities Clarity Act included in this
legislation. This provision provides market certainty for innovators
and clear jurisdictional boundaries for regulators.
Subsequently, elements of the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act
were included, clarifying, once and for all, that digital asset
developers and service providers who do not custody consumer funds are
not considered money transmitters.
Importantly, the CLARITY Act will help further decentralize our
financial system so that Americans can forgo intermediaries and
transact directly with each other.
Having this choice will fundamentally transform the digital economy
and unlock new opportunities for innovators, investors, and consumers
around the globe.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hill and Chairman Thompson for their
leadership and for working with us to include our two bills in the
CLARITY Act.
The United States has the opportunity to lead and deliver on
President Trump's promise to make America the crypto capital of the
world. We cannot and will not fail.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Casten), who is also the vice ranking member of the
Financial Services Committee.
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, the only thing you need to know about the
CLARITY Act is that it is designed to destroy U.S. capital markets.
U.S. capital markets are the envy of the world because investors like
putting their money in them. They are the envy of the world because we
provide robust investor protections when people put their money in
them, because of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Yet, the
CLARITY Act would allow companies to raise up to $200 million over 4
years without any disclosure and without any transparency, just by
tokenizing their security.
Let's be clear. Putting a security on the blockchain doesn't make
investors safe. It might make money for the crypto industry. Mr.
Speaker, I know you all like that. It might make it possible for the
companies to temporarily raise more money from dumb investors because
they don't get that protection. If we stop protecting investors, then
why would investors put their money in the stock market? They will
abandon the U.S. to go to places with a better risk-reward.
I understand we have a lot of fraud and grift in the White House. I
understand Republicans are big fans of fraud and grift in the White
House, but we don't need any more.
Let's protect Americans' hard-earned savings. Let's protect markets
and not just make crypto bros richer. I urge a resounding hell no.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), who is the
[[Page H3400]]
vice chairman of our full committee and who is a longtime advocate for
reform in the digital markets.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those remarks from the chair.
The digital asset ecosystem currently operates in a fragmented
regulatory environment that lends itself to significant challenges for
both businesses and, more importantly, investors.
The ambiguity in classifying a digital asset, either as a security or
a commodity, has led to confusion, legal uncertainty, and, ultimately,
consumer harm.
American innovation is a critical element in job creation and
economic opportunity here in the United States. Congress must look to
preserve this competitive advantage and not let it leave our shores.
By passing a comprehensive market structure framework, responsible
actors will now have greater certainty and consumers greater protection
from bad actors.
This bill establishes a regulatory framework for digital assets that
aligns with our existing financial markets while accounting for the
unique characteristics of digital assets.
Mr. Speaker, our markets are the envy of the world. American
innovation is a critical element of job creation and economic
opportunity here in the United States. Congress must not cede its
responsibility.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important
legislation.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentleman from
California (Mr. Sherman), who is also the ranking member of the
Subcommittee on Capital Markets.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I submitted many amendments to Rules, as
did other Democrats. They made only one in order. I will not be
offering it because in the absence of the other amendments, it is
really not useful.
This bill is an attack on working families, which is why the AFL-CIO
says no, and they are scoring it.
This bill prohibits Congress Members from sponsoring cryptocurrencies
because of the obvious corruption and conflict of interest, but it
allows the President to create electronic Monopoly money.
Who is buying? Abu Dhabi is buying $2 billion of Trump stablecoin
while the Chinese interests behind TikTok are buying $300 million worth
of Trump coin, and that is just what we know about. There is a lot we
don't know about because cryptocurrency literally means hidden money.
It allows for bailouts under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve
Act. Jay Powell won't do it, but the next guy will.
Congress won't stop him because crypto spends more in super-PAC than
any other industry by far, five times more than the combination of Big
Oil and Big Pharma.
It allows for the purchase of bitcoin and Trump coin, and Trump has
announced that he is going to do just that with our tax dollars going
into his crypto.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the
gentleman from California.
Mr. SHERMAN. Finally, this creates the perfect financial tool for
drug dealers and for tax evaders because every time a billionaire
cheats on his taxes, a member of the Freedom Caucus earns his wings.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. Davidson), who is the chairman of our Subcommittee on
National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial
Institutions and a longtime policy advocate for reform in our digital
markets.
{time}  0950
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, the ability to move payment or digital
tokens that represent other assets person to person, without a third
party or intermediary, across any space digitally at the speed of light
is part of the reason this industry was created.
What do those tokens represent? Either securities, commodities or
real world assets? We have needed a bright-line test since this market
began to decide who regulates them.
I introduced the first piece of legislation on this back in 2018
called the Token Taxonomy Act. Think of the harm that could have been
prevented if we had that bright-line test all this time.
The other essential component is self-custody, the ability to control
your own assets. You can't go person to person if you have to go
through an intermediary without a permission.
It does that. It does just what we need it to do, just like cash. We
finally have market structure in place with this bill. I hope the
Senate delivers the same structure soon, and we get the certainty the
markets need.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New
York (Ms. Velazquez), who is also the ranking member of the Small
Business Committee.
Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this
bill. It is ironic we are debating a bill called the CLARITY Act when
it offers no clarity on one of the biggest issues in crypto, the
blatant conflicts of interest inside our own government.
Since returning to office, President Trump has turned the Presidency
into a crypto cash machine. It is now estimated that crypto makes up
the majority of Donald Trump's net worth.
Foreign investors, some under Federal investigation, are pouring
millions into these ventures, buying access, influence, and favorable
treatment.
So I ask: What are we doing here?
With this bill, not only are we continuing to allow President Trump
to issue his cryptocurrency, but we are allowing him and his cronies to
be in charge of the regulators overseeing that venture and compromising
the stability of capital markets in our country.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time
remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arkansas has 2\1/2\
minutes remaining.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Nebraska (Mr. Flood), the chair of our Subcommittee on Housing and
Insurance.
Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. It has been a longer wait
than expected, but I am excited that the CLARITY Act has finally made
it to the House floor for debate.
The CLARITY Act is not just about digital assets like bitcoin. This
bill will usher in a new age of blockchain innovation that will go well
beyond the tokens that we know well today.
Chris Dixon's book titled: ``Read Write Own'' talks about a future
where blockchain technology enables a new generation of the internet
which he terms ``Web 3.0.''
Technologies like NFTs can be used as tickets to events, identity
verification tools, and serve other real-world uses that will change
our digital economy.
I urge my colleagues to see the bigger picture. The vote today is not
just about cryptocurrency as we know it. It is about enabling the next
generation of innovation enabled by blockchain.
This is a good, bipartisan product that builds on years of work from
Chairman Hill, Subcommittee Chairman Steil, the Financial Services
Committee, and the Agriculture Committee.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Foster), who is also the ranking member of the
Subcommittee on Financial Institutions.
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the CLARITY Act,
which claims to bring digital assets under a regulatory umbrella but
fails in two major areas.
First, it fails because it has no KYC--know your customer--
requirements for self-hosted wallets. It allows anonymous trading on
DeFi exchanges and the dark web, which means there is no way to prevent
wash trading, front running, corruption, ransomware, extortion and
kidnapping payoffs, and all the parade of horribles that unregulated
crypto has unleashed upon the world.
This legislation simply applies a patina of regulation while
codifying loopholes that leave large parts of the industry, including
the President's own meme coin schemes, completely unregulated.
[[Page H3401]]
Secondly, the CLARITY Act also lacks the basic investor protections
present in the securities laws. For example, firms are not required to
serve the best interests of their investors or to separate critical
market functions and many other basic protections.
Now, I am not ideologically opposed to crypto, and both of these
flaws are fixable, but in CLARITY they have not been fixed.
Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote
``no.''
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald).
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the
bipartisan CLARITY Act, commonsense legislation that finally gives
digital asset markets the regulatory certainty they need to grow
responsibly right here in the United States.
For too long, innovators have been stuck in a regulatory gray zone
caught between agencies and overlapping authority and subject to
enforcement instead of clear rules.
The uncertainty has driven jobs, investment, and innovation offshore
while leaving American consumers exposed.
The CLARITY Act fixes this. It establishes clear, functional rules
for digital assets, drawing a bright line between the SEC and the CFTC
and creating strong, enforceable protections for consumers.
It ensures the digital assets developers and consumer-facing firms
play by the rules, disclosing who owns what, segregating customer
funds, and avoiding conflicts of interest.
It is long overdue, and I commend the chairmen for bringing this bill
to the floor today.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from
Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), an unapologetic leader for justice.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in vigorous opposition to the
CLARITY Act. This bill gives a green light to self-enriching crypto
schemes where officials at the highest levels of power, including in
the White House, have generated hundreds of billions of dollars in
personal profit.
We need legislation that stops financial abuse, not encourages it,
especially during a time when the SEC has dropped enforcement actions
against major crypto firms and undermined investor safety.
Across our country, millions of working families are battling rising
costs, our elders are targeted by financial scams, and investors are
trying to recover from volatile markets. Republicans are ignoring all
of that to prioritize the crypto industry's wish list.
To be clear, the people deserve crypto legislation that is fair,
transparent, and accountable, not a bill that opens the floodgates to
conflicts of interest and weakens investor protections.
The CLARITY Act fails that test. Republicans need some clarity all
right: moral and legislative. I agree with Ranking Member Waters that
this is really the calamity act.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my
time.
We are here today, Mr. Speaker, because of the exceptional work by
the House Financial Services Committee over a 5-year period, including
under the leadership of then-Chairwoman Maxine Waters and former
Chairman Patrick McHenry, gathering feedback from experts, looking at
market participants, analyzing the markets, and talking to regulators.
That is how we got the CLARITY Act on the floor today. It is built on
the backs of that hard work.
This Chamber passed a similar bill in the last Congress with
exceedingly strong, bipartisan support. Since then, the CLARITY Act has
only been further refined and strengthened in terms of legal certainty
and consumer protection.
This bill, Mr. Speaker, as we have demonstrated over that period of
time, would prevent consumer harm like FTX.
Mr. Speaker, I support the bill. I urge my colleagues to support the
bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 2
minutes remaining.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).
{time}  1000
Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the so-called
CLARITY Act.
Let me be clear: I support the growth of digital assets, blockchain
innovation, and the promise that crypto holds for expanding financial
access and economic justice, but this bill is not clarity. It is
confusion cloaked in legislation. It picks winners and losers, and the
biggest winner is the President of the United States.
Why is that office exempt from all of the rules? It undermines the
SEC's ability to protect consumers and fast-tracks deregulatory
loopholes without addressing core issues like transparency, fraud
prevention, or equity and access. The SEC doesn't even like this bill.
We need comprehensive, thoughtful regulation, not rushed frameworks
driven by the people who will gain the most who ignore the voices of
everyday investors, builders, and communities left behind.
Crypto deserves rules that are smart, fair, and future-facing. The
CLARITY Act is none of these things because, if it was, Republicans
would have had the votes much earlier.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, let me reiterate: A vote for H.R. 3633 is a vote to give
Trump the pen to write the rules that would put more money into his
family's pockets. A vote for H.R. 3633 is a vote for increased investor
harm. A vote for H.R. 3633 is a vote to plant the seeds for the next
financial crisis. A vote for H.R. 3633 is a vote to endanger our
national security.
That is why I am voting ``no'' on H.R. 3633, the calamity act, and I
urge all Members to not give a vote to Trump to own crypto and not to
give a vote to the Vice President. They are the only two elected
officials in this bill who can own crypto businesses.
I want to see all of the Cabinet, the President, the Vice President,
and all Members of Congress unable to own crypto businesses.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote no, no, no, on this bill, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for Financial Services debate has
expired.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) and the gentlewoman
from Minnesota (Ms. Craig) each will control 15 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time
as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I am incredibly proud today to stand before you to share
my support for the CLARITY Act. This is legislation that we have been
working on in the Agriculture Committee for 7 years. This is an
improvement over the legislation that fulfilled the very same purpose
of what we are addressing today that passed last Congress with over 300
votes, including 71 Democrats, and it was a great bipartisan bill. This
is an improvement on that bill.
The CLARITY Act is about three related ideas: certainty, protection,
and innovation. I will talk about why each of these ideas is important.
First, the CLARITY Act provides regulatory certainty for all corners
of the digital asset ecosystem, including issuers; exchanges;
intermediaries; builders; software developers; and, most importantly,
users of digital assets.
This regulatory certainty means that all parts of the ecosystem can
engage with digital assets with confidence. It promotes healthy markets
by establishing commonsense requirements to protect consumers. Those
are all built on the existing requirements in the financial services
markets.
Secondly, the CLARITY Act protects good actors from government
overreach. By establishing clear rules, we limit the government's
ability to subjectively enforce vague statutes. These protections are
important to those entities like exchanges, brokers, and dealers, who
we require to register. Yet, in many cases, they are more important to
entities which Congress is not seeking to register.
[[Page H3402]]
Third, and most importantly, the CLARITY Act supports innovation
across the economy, not just the crypto economy.
At the House Agriculture Committee, we heard testimony from numerous
stakeholders about innovative ways in which developers and
entrepreneurs are leveraging blockchain to build projects and services
using blockchains and digital assets.
The certainty and protections provided through the CLARITY Act will
lead to the development of a new generation of services, tools, and
systems. I am excited for that future to happen here in the United
States of America.
Mr. Speaker, Congress has a historic opportunity here today to act.
With the CLARITY Act, we can pass legislation that protects consumers
and ensures that the United States remains at the forefront of
technological innovation. These are not mutually exclusive goals. They
are mutually reinforcing goals.
By supporting the CLARITY Act, we can create a safer, more
transparent, and more accessible environment for digital assets.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of nearly 44 million American
consumers who have invested in, traded, or used digital assets. That is
one in five Americans. The public interest in these markets is already
here, and it is not going away.
Under the status quo, there is a gap in regulation for the digital
commodity asset market. Our work here today could begin to provide the
protections that American investors are accustomed to in traditional
financial markets that are regulated by the CFTC.
Regardless of whether Congress acts, these markets will continue to
grow. The only question is whether we will begin the hard work of
developing regulation or refuse to begin.
The CLARITY Act would put consumer protections in place for the first
time for this industry. Consumers will finally be protected by the same
sort of guardrails that protect investors in other sectors of the
economy: segregation of customer deposits, consumer disclosures,
mandatory recordkeeping, and examination by regulators. We do not want
another FTX.
The 2022 collapse of the world's third largest cryptocurrency
exchange wiped out an estimated $8 billion to $10 billion in value,
leaving American consumers holding the bag. The CLARITY Act would have
largely mitigated or avoided this crisis entirely.
Former Biden administration CFTC Chairman Russ Behnam testified
yesterday before the Senate Agriculture Committee:
`` . . . inaction will only result in greater risk to our financial
markets and investors, through lack of market transparency, fraud,
market manipulation, corruption, and conflicts of interest.''
That is lack of action.
Mr. Speaker, let me address the elephant in the room: the First
Family's involvement with digital assets and personally profiting from
them.
It has rightfully raised questions of impropriety and alarmed
government ethics watchdogs. The First Family's personal financial
involvement in other sectors, such as telecoms, should ring alarm
bells, as well, loud and clear as it comes to ethics in our country.
There is a time and place for holding the powerful accountable, and
that must happen. We should address executive branch corruption
independently, and it should apply to all sectors.
Today, we must focus on regulation and protections for consumers
because, today, one in five Americans, and growing, lack those
protections and lack any guardrails. It is our job to start putting
them in place.
Is this bill perfect? No. Can it be improved upon? Absolutely, and I
encourage my Senate colleagues to keep working on those outstanding
issues.
This bill deserves our support, and I urge my colleagues to vote
``yes.''
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I was remiss with my
opening comments not to thank my Agriculture Committee partner, Ranking
Member Angie Craig, for her leadership and for working together with me
on this issue, but also our Financial Services Committee Chair French
Hill; my good friend, Don Davis; Whip Emmer; Bryan Steil, and so many
more. There was just such a strong bipartisan leadership partner team.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.
Feenstra), a member of the House Agriculture Committee.
Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thompson for bringing
this bill forward. It is an amazing bill.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the CLARITY Act. The
increasing adoption of digital assets and the use of blockchain
technologies can grow our economy and provide American families with a
new opportunity to grow wealth.
{time}  1010
However, under President Biden, digital assets were attacked, which
crushed innovation and created uncertainty for businesses.
Fortunately, President Trump is working to make America the crypto
capital of the world. We want digital asset innovation to happen in
America and crypto jobs to be created in America without ceding ground
to foreign countries.
That is why we must pass the CLARITY Act, to spur innovation and
support economic growth by providing clear rules of the road for
digital assets in the United States.
This bill establishes clear roles for the SEC and CFTC, which
prevents agencies from overreach and confusion. It provides consumer
protections through greater transparency and accountability in the
marketplace. It fosters innovation by providing a pathway for digital
asset firms to operate legally and with confidence, encouraging digital
asset innovation to remain in the U.S. The CLARITY Act unlocks economic
growth, global competitiveness, and financial opportunity for all.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and put
America first in the race to lead the global digital asset marketplace
for our country.
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. Davis), my distinguished colleague and the ranking member
of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Commodity Markets, Digital
Assets, and Rural Development.
Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
3633, known as the CLARITY Act.
I am honored to serve as a co-lead on this legislation, alongside
Chairman Thompson, Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Craig, Subcommittee
Chair Johnson, and so many others who came to the table in good faith
to get this done.
Let me also take a moment to thank the staff, both the majority and
the minority staff. They put in so many hours working on this. I know I
was up late one night. It was probably midnight. I really commend the
team. They helped work on a very complex issue here that is before us
and to help shape a bipartisan product that reflects the seriousness of
the moment.
This bill reflects compromise, collaboration, and months of work to
craft the regulatory framework that meets the moment, because the truth
is, we can't afford to fall behind.
Right now we are at a crossroad. The digital asset industry is
growing, evolving, changing the way people around the world engage with
financial markets and emerging technologies. Without a clear regulatory
structure in place, we are seeing innovation move overseas not because
our talent isn't here, but because the rules aren't here.
The CLARITY Act provides us with an opportunity then to change that,
to lead, to establish thoughtful and balanced guardrails that support
innovation, protect consumers, and foster confidence in our markets.
You see disclosures and reports dealing with so many provisions,
antifraud, manipulation. You can't commingle funds.
But let me be clear: The bill isn't perfect. I have been vocal about
that, too.
I remain concerned about the absence of meaningful conflict-of-
interest provisions dealing with the executive branch. It doesn't
matter who occupies the White House. The bottom line is,
[[Page H3403]]
whoever is in the White House, we need clear standards that ensure
public trust is never compromised.
I also remain concerned about adequate resources for the CFTC. Yes, I
acknowledge this bill provides more flexibility to deal with hiring,
but we also need to see more resources because we are asking the CFTC
to take on a major role here.
The Speaker pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentleman from North Carolina.
Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. In the 118th Congress, we passed FIT21
with overwhelming bipartisan support. The CLARITY Act builds on this
work. Let's pass the CLARITY Act and send a strong message to the
American people and the world that the United States will lead in
building a forward-looking digital economy.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nunn), a member of the Commodity Markets,
Digital Assets, and Rural Development Subcommittee.
Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thompson, as well as
Ranking Member Craig for leading a truly bipartisan opportunity to help
America deliver as a crypto capital for the entire planet.
As a member of both the Agriculture Committee and the Financial
Services Committee, I have been able to see this issue on both sides:
commodities versus securities, CFTC versus the SEC.
In my home State of rural Iowa, we know commodities: corn, soybeans,
hogs. The CFTC does this very well. In downtown Des Moines and on the
Main Streets of hometowns across Iowa, our banks handle stocks and
bonds, securities, those handled by the SEC.
That level of clarity works, but when it comes to digital assets, the
lines become blurred, confused, and overly burdensome. That regulatory
uncertainty doesn't just cost dollars. It costs jobs, innovation, and
America's global leadership.
The CLARITY Act is exactly what America needs now to drive toward the
future to ensure the next generation of financial internet technology
and blockchain success is built in America, that our innovators come
from the U.S., and that we have a future going forward. Mr. Speaker, I
endorse the CLARITY Act.
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Ms. McDonald Rivet), my distinguished colleague who serves on
the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Commodity Markets,
Digital Assets, and Rural Development.
Ms. McDONALD RIVET. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice support for
the CLARITY Act. While there is still work to be done, it is an
important step in providing crucial and clear regulatory framework to
the crypto industry.
Let's break it down. Today, one in six U.S. adults, 17 percent of the
population, are invested in or use cryptocurrency. That is 55 million
Americans. There is more than $3 trillion invested in the industry. It
is dangerous and irresponsible that a market of this size and scope is
currently operating without a clear regulatory framework. For
consumers, innovators, and the stability of our Nation's economy, the
CLARITY Act is an important first step forward.
It protects consumers and equips assigned agencies with the
appropriate authority to provide efficient and thorough oversight over
digital asset markets. It also provides desperately needed certainty so
that businesses can grow and evolve.
I will be clear: If the CLARITY Act had been in place, the FTX market
crash that caused their customers to lose $8 billion would not have
happened.
This bill strengthens our national security by giving regulators the
tools they need to track cross-border transactions and stop digital
assets from being used to evade sanctions or fund our adversaries.
The bill is not perfect, and it does not resolve every issue. Like
many of my colleagues, I am deeply concerned about the Trump family's
potential conflicts of interest in using crypto to profit from the
Office of the Presidency. That is why I voted for amendments to impose
guardrails to stop elected officials from improperly profiting off
trades, and I will continue to push strongly for solutions to this
problem.
However, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We stand
at a critical moment where market structure is critical for our
consumers, economy, and security, and the CLARITY Act moves us
meaningfully forward.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I will expand for a minute
on the important protections included in the CLARITY Act. The CLARITY
Act includes strong protections for the developers of software.
Sections 309 and 409 make it clear that neither the CFTC nor the SEC
have the authority to require a person to register just because that
person is developing, publishing, or distributing software. This is a
critical protection, rooted in our First Amendment, that should be read
expansively by the commissions.
{time}  1020
The creation of new decentralized finance protocols is also an
important development that the CLARITY Act seeks to protect. Both the
CFTC and the SEC must carefully examine and understand DeFi, which is
why we are requiring both Commissions to undertake a robust study on
the unique benefits and risks of DeFi.
Through the CLARITY Act, Congress is making an unambiguous statement
that DeFi is different, and it should be treated differently from the
centralized custodial intermediaries. Protecting this emerging
technology is an essential purpose of the CLARITY Act.
Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.
Messmer), a member of the Committee on Agriculture and a member of the
Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development Subcommittee.
Mr. MESSMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the CLARITY Act.
America's innovative ecosystem has made our Nation an investment
magnet and development hub, but thus far, our regulatory system has
failed the digital assets industry. Under the current framework,
fraudsters go unpunished, consumers remain unprotected, and the best
and brightest minds in the industry have picked up and left for other
countries.
The CLARITY Act finally establishes distinct jurisdictional
boundaries between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while also creating guardrails to
incentivize and safeguard investment.
The bill not only expands opportunities for Wall Street and Silicon
Valley, but it also provides great opportunities for Hoosier farmers by
opening a new frontier for rural innovators and expanding access to
capital in agricultural communities.
The digital asset markets are in dire need of regulation, and the
CLARITY Act is the solution. I look forward to witnessing a new era of
economic prosperity and technological advancement that this bill will
bring to America.
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. Figures), my distinguished colleague.
Mr. FIGURES. Mr. Speaker, I have listened to many of my colleagues'
views on the issues before us today. I respect them all, and I respect
their views. I don't disagree with many of the points that my
colleagues who are in opposition are making, especially as it relates
to executive conflict of interest concerns.
Here is what I know. I know that the United States is lagging behind
the rest of the world in regulating this industry. I know that the
regulations in the CLARITY Act are better than none at all in this
industry. I know that consumers will be better protected the day after
this goes into effect than they were the day before.
Now, is there more work to be done? Absolutely. We should do that. We
cannot allow subjective ideas of perfection to override what are
objectively steps in the right direction.
The CLARITY Act is one act that I support, and this is an important
first step. As we move forward, however, we must continue to make the
necessary investments so that everyone can participate. Those are
investments in technical training and education so that people have the
knowledge and
[[Page H3404]]
skills to actually understand and participate in a digital economy.
This is also a time to commit ourselves to ensuring that we do not
leave underserved and rural communities behind. I represent a district
that is geographically predominantly rural. We still struggle with
issues like not having access to the internet in many counties that I
represent.
You cannot participate in or leverage the benefits of a digital
economy if you can't get on the internet. That is a fact. We must stand
up for these communities and bring broadband and internet expansion
resources to every community that we possibly can.
Let's keep moving forward. Let's keep making sure that we are
bringing everyone along with us.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman who
just spoke for his remarks concerning the need for high-speed
broadband. My pledge, as the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture,
is that when we are back in September, we will have farm bill 2.0,
which includes rural economic development and rural broadband. We have
to get that done.
I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), a cosponsor of
the CLARITY Act, for 1 minute.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support
for the CLARITY Act.
The CLARITY Act is a bill that will make clear laws to help better
regulate digital assets and blockchain technology. This bill will
ensure that future innovations in the financial world will happen here
in the United States and not in foreign countries.
We cannot allow our adversaries, such as China, to control the
digital economy. The CLARITY Act will help modernize financial laws to
make innovation possible and clear up many opaque and sometimes
contradictory laws.
This bill delivers on President Trump's commitment to make the United
States the crypto capital of the world, and I am proud that we are
paving the path toward American dominance in the digital future.
Today, I again would like to give my support for the CLARITY Act, as
it cements America as a hub for the world's financial innovation.
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), my distinguished colleague who serves on the
House Financial Services Committee.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Craig for her
excellent leadership.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan CLARITY Act. This
bill was made possible through a bipartisan effort that I was very
proud to help lead with Chairman Hill and Congressman Steil. It is an
important one because one-fifth of Americans own crypto. My State, New
Jersey, proportionally ranks second nationwide in ownership of
cryptocurrency.
While cryptocurrency has tremendous economic potential, we
desperately need rules of the road to protect consumers, ensure the
success of American entrepreneurs, and ensure that America leads the
way, not other nations around the world, but that America leads the way
in this growing space.
The CLARITY Act takes commonsense steps to make crypto work for
everyday users, including measures to stop snake oil salesmen,
fraudsters, and hucksters, and puts the Trump family's coins under
regulation.
This legislation supports American-led innovation by encouraging
developers and entrepreneurs to build, invest, and create jobs in our
country.
Finally, this bill gives clarity to the SEC's and CFTC's roles in
crypto to work together efficiently and to crack down on scammers and
criminal activity. After years of uncertainty, it finally says who
should oversee what, so that people in this space understand the
direction it is going in and understand who is going to oversee what,
so that consumers can be protected. I can't say that enough.
Do we want this to continue to be the Wild West with uncertainty, or
do we want to have clear rules of the road to protect consumers? Do we
want to do something or nothing? Is it perfect? As you have heard
today, no, it is not perfect. Few pieces of legislation we bring here
are.
The questions are: Will it do good? Will it make sure that we look
after people who are involved in this space? Will it ensure that
America succeeds and grows? Those are the questions.
To do nothing means that we will ensure that Trump's coin has no
oversight. Why would we want that? We will ensure that no consumer is
protected if we do nothing. We want to protect American consumers. That
is our job. This legislation does that.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical
commonsense, bipartisan legislation.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is
remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Murphy). The gentleman from Pennsylvania
has 5\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Minnesota has 2\1/2\
minutes remaining.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose), the vice chair of the Commodity
Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development Subcommittee and also a
member of the House Financial Services Committee. He is a very busy
man.
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the CLARITY Act, which
provides long-overdue updates aimed at protecting the future of digital
assets, encouraging growth, and protecting American consumers.
The days of stifling this emerging industry through litigation and
rogue rulemaking must end. The Securities and Exchange Commission under
former Chair Gary Gensler went far outside the agency's statutory
mandate in many ways, especially with cryptocurrencies.
The CLARITY Act will strengthen transparency and accountability for
consumers. It will require developers to provide accurate disclosures
with details about the asset project's operation, ownership, and
structure. It requires brokers and dealers to disclose important
information to investors, to hold their own funds separate from their
customers' funds, and to report any conflicts of interest.
This bill ensures Americans know where they are putting their money,
and it gets government out of the way of growth and innovation.
Let's pass the CLARITY Act for the good of this country.
{time}  1030
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers at the moment. I
continue to reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), the chairman of the
Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development Subcommittee.
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. Speaker, it has been such an honor
to work with G.T., French, Angie, Don, Brian, and so many others on
something that is real.
It is sometimes hard to separate the real from the fake in this town.
That is certainly true for digital assets, NFTs, and memecoins. These
generate tremendous attention, and they can pull our gaze away from
what really matters.
Here is what matters: Blockchain technology, Web3, will transform
every single industry in the same way that the internet has transformed
every single industry over the last 30 years. That transformation will
happen much faster than people realize if we can keep government from
continuing to screw this up.
This is not about buying bubble gum with bitcoin. This is about
blockchain innovation happening here rather than overseas, about more
liquid capital markets, about small businesses creating new services
and products, about removing friction from transactions for every
single American, and about protecting consumers so the debacles like
the FTX meltdown never happen again.
We tend to overstate the impact of what we do in this town.
Everything is historic, even when it is not. However, this is
different. This is huge.
Before I came to Congress, I was in the broadband industry, and the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 provided the regulatory certainty needed
to launch the internet era. That was a watershed victory for this
country. Mr. Speaker, we are here again.
[[Page H3405]]
The regulatory certainty provided by this incredible bipartisan work
product will launch a golden age of innovation and the golden age of
digital assets. Today, now, this moment, this is a watershed victory
for this country. Today we do something real.
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance
of my time for the purpose of closing.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Dakota for his remarks
and, quite frankly, I couldn't agree more. I also thank, again, my
Agriculture partner, Ranking Member Angie Craig with the Agriculture
Committee, and Don Davis and our leadership and all those who have the
foresight to see that this is about the future. Well, it is about today
because, you know, companies are struggling with this, but more
importantly, it is about the future of both the financial sector and
the technological sector.
A vote for the CLARITY Act is a vote for America's future and
America's leadership. I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the
CLARITY Act. I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to
close.
Mr. Speaker, I, too, would like to thank the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, Chairman G.T. Thompson, and his team for working on this
consumer protection legislation in a bipartisan manner.
I believe bipartisan legislation is always preferable to partisan
legislation. It is stronger. It is harder to undo when it has broad
support and leadership changes overnight.
I heard my chairman talk about the farm bill. I regret that it wasn't
a bipartisan path through reconciliation for farm bill provisions, but
I am optimistic that we can work together in many other areas.
While I wait to see what the gentleman has in store for us for farm
programs left behind, I, too, agree that rural development is
incredibly important, Mr. Speaker. I hope that the bipartisanship shown
through the CLARITY Act process can act as a reminder that we
accomplish more and we go further when we work together.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.
The Chair understands that amendment No. 1 will not be offered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question
is ordered on the bill, as amended.
The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was
read the third time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the bill.
The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further
proceedings on this question will be postponed.
