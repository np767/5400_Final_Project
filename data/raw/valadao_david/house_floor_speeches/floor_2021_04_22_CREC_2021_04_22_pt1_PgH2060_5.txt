HONORING THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF DAVID KERN
(Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and memory of
David Kern.
David recently passed away at the age of 79, following a long fight
with cancer. I am particularly extending my condolences to his beloved
wife, Katy; his 4 children and 11 grandchildren.
David was a veteran of the United States Army, a volunteer
firefighter, a small business owner. He served as Liberty Township
Trustee for 32 years, and he was chairman of the Butler County
Republican Party. He was an avid hunter, fisherman, and
conservationist.
More than all that, however, he was a friend and someone who gave me
sound advice and used his influence as a mentor.
David Kern was a very good man, and his presence will be sorely
missed by his family, our community, and all who knew and loved him.
