HONORING OHIO STATE REPRESENTATIVE JIM BUCHY
(Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and pay tribute to Ohio
State Representative Jim Buchy.
Representative Jim Buchy will retire from the State House at the end
of the year. In fact, this week will likely mark the last time on the
floor for Jim Buchy as a representative, having served for more than 20
years in that role.
I am thankful to know Jim. I respect him tremendously because he has
been characterized more by his deeds than by his words. He is a strong
Christian, a solid conservative, and an articulate Republican. He has
championed the cause of freedom with great ideals, but a genuine
passion to represent the people in his district and their common values
in public service. He is a good man.
Jim lives in Greenville, Ohio. He has raised a beautiful family,
built and exited a very successful business, served the community--in
his church, on the board of education, with 4-H, economic development,
and in many ways. He has been a genuine leader in the Ohio pro-life
movement.
He is passionate about improving education with local control. He has
spent his career promoting traditional, value-based education and
important programs like FFA and 4-H.
Jim Buchy's role in the legislature will be missed, but he will live
on through his reputation and the great example he set.
Thank you for your service, Jim, and thanks for living your faith
boldly, for loving your community dearly, and for giving so much of
yourself in service to make sure the next generation is better off than
they would have been without your leadership and service. God bless
you.
