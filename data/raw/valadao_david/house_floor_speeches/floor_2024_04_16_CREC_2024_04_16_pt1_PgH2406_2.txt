Mr. RESCHENTHALER. For the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
McGovern), the ranking member of the Rules Committee and my good
friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During
consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose
of debate only.
General Leave
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all
[[Page H2407]]
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their
remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the
gentleman from Pennsylvania?
There was no objection.
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in
support of the underlying legislation.
House Resolution 1149 provides for consideration of six measures:
H.R. 6323, H. Res. 1143, H.R. 4691, H.R. 5947, H.R. 6046, and H.R.
4639.
The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 6323, the Iran

Additionally, the rule provides for consideration of H. Res. 1143, a

closed rule with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs

4639, the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, under a structured rule
with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their
respective designees and provides one motion to recommit. The rule
makes in order three amendments.
Mr. Speaker, President Joe Biden's foreign policy decisions have been
a complete disaster on the world stage and have emboldened our
adversaries and empowered foreign terrorist organizations.
Sadly, we were forewarned about all of this. Former President Obama's
Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, stated nearly a decade ago regarding
President Biden: ``I think he has been wrong on nearly every major
foreign policy and national security issue over the past four
decades.''
He is right. Let's look at the facts.
In the first year alone, the President green-lit Nord Stream 2 to
provide Russian gas to Europe while simultaneously blocking the
Keystone XL pipeline here at home. He issued 94 executive orders on
immigration, which has led to an unprecedented invasion at our southern
border. To appease his far-left radical base, he delisted the Houthis
as a foreign terrorist organization, which directly led to this
conflict in the Red Sea. He is responsible for the complete surrender
of Afghanistan, which killed 13 American servicemembers, stranded
thousands of Americans, returned the Taliban to power, and expanded
ISIS-K and al-Qaida.
In 2022, his policies of appeasement led to the largest invasion of
Europe since World War II. To help his party in the mid-terms, he
depleted the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to its lowest levels since I
was born, 1983, and he sent millions of barrels of oil to Communist
China.
In the first days of 2023, he allowed a Chinese spy balloon to cross
the entire country, which collected intelligence on innocent Americans.
On the 22nd anniversary of 9/11, on the very anniversary, in an insult
to the people who suffered those terrorist attacks, Joe Biden unfroze
$6 billion in oil sanctions to Iran just days before an Iranian proxy
group killed over a thousand people in Israel.
How does Iran thank us? Our troops in the Middle East faced over 100
attacks from proxy networks, which led to the death of three
servicemembers in Jordan.
Just this year, Biden waived billions of dollars in sanctions to
allow Iranian energy exports into Iraq--and I kid you not--while also
announcing an indefinite pause to new approvals of U.S. liquefied
natural gas exports from here.
Guess who benefits from that? It is not the United States. It is not
the American worker. It is Russia, China, and Iran who benefit from Joe
Biden's reckless foreign policy.
This administration's policies truly embody the slogan: America last.
That is why House Republicans are bringing to the floor this week
legislation to condemn Iran's recent attack on Israel, block Biden's
ransom payments to Iran, redesignate the Houthis as a foreign terrorist
organization, and apply maximum pressure on the Iranian regime.
We cannot stand idly by as the Biden administration hands over the
keys to the Ayatollah; the dictator in Communist China, Chairman Xi;
and the dictator Vladimir Putin.
This week's votes will be very clear: Do you stand with our ally and
strategic partner Israel, or do you stand with the authoritarian regime
in Tehran?
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania
for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time
as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I join the gentleman from Pennsylvania in condemning
Iran's attack on Israel, and I also express my growing concern at this
situation. I hope that President Biden continues working to de-escalate
tensions. I don't think that any of us want this to turn into a broader
conflict that puts even more civilians at risk.
Mr. Speaker, I also thank President Biden because, as Commander in
Chief, he ordered our military to shoot down more than 70 drones and 3
ballistic missiles that Iran launched. Because of his actions and his
work to unite our allies in the region, Israeli airspace was defended,
and 99 percent of the projectiles fired by Iran were intercepted.
That is real. That is concrete. That is tangible.
Listening to my friends on the other side. I think they blame Joe
Biden for everything. I mean, they blame him for Iran's attack more
than they blame Iran. I think they have people on their side who blame
Joe Biden for the earthquake, and I think one of my friends on the
other side of the aisle blamed Joe Biden for the eclipse. This is
crazy.
At some point they need to stop playing the blame game and work with
Democrats to address these global challenges in a thoughtful and
bipartisan way. Instead of doing that, instead of bringing everybody
together, what we have from Republicans is a fake response to a real
crisis.
The majority dusted off a bunch of old bills, some of which have
never had a hearing and have never been marked up by committee, and
they are bringing them to the floor. I guess they decided the original
schedule for the week would have looked bad because they originally
planned to bring up bills dealing with household appliances.
You heard that right, Mr. Speaker. With all the crises going on in
the world, the majority's plan this week was to bring up a bill about
refrigerator freedom. Not just one bill or two bills; they had a whole
week, six bills, dedicated to appliances. They wanted us to debate the
Liberty in Laundry Act this week. It took an actual international
emergency to get them to notice how out of touch and absurd their
policy agenda is.
Meanwhile, Democrats have been saying for months and months that we
need Republicans to get serious about helping our allies, and for
months we have heard excuse after excuse from Republicans.
First, they said we had to wait until H.R. 2, their extreme MAGA
border bill, became law. Then they changed their tune because they
tanked their
[[Page H2408]]
own border bill. Next, they told us to wait until the Federal
Government was fully funded. We did that, and the MAGA caucus moved the
goalposts yet again. Then Democrats were told aid for Ukraine had to
wait until the House reauthorized FISA.
Guess what, Mr. Speaker? Republicans are out of excuses and our
allies are out of time. Speaker Johnson's inaction has consequences. He
has emboldened our adversaries and left our allies wondering: Where is
America? I hear reports that he is in backroom discussions with Members
to find a way forward on Ukraine funding, and I hope that we see the
aid our allies need on the floor this week and that there is no
partisan B.S. attached to it.
What our allies need right now aren't more empty, do-nothing
exercises and political messaging like we are doing today. They need
our help immediately.
These bills we are debating do not meet this moment at all. The very
first thing we should have done this week is come back and debate a
bipartisan bill that can provide real, tangible help to our allies.
Instead, we get more wasted time, more broken promises, more useless
rhetoric from this Republican majority.
Has anyone even asked the Senate if these bills are going anywhere
over there, Mr. Speaker?
They passed the sanctions bill on Iran 6 months ago and haven't sent
it to the Senate yet. Are they going to send any of these bills to the
Senate or is this all for show, so they can send out a press release to
say they did something?
Meanwhile, the world is wondering when America will get our act
together and when this Republican majority is going to get their act
together, stop playing politics, and start doing their job.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, in recent days, far-left activists
have chanted ``Death to America'' and ``Death to Israel.''
In Chicago, cheers broke out over the weekend when Iran started
attacking Israel during a meeting about the upcoming DNC convention.
Just think about that for a moment. This isn't your grandfather's
Democratic Party.
In the 3 months following the October 7 attack, there has been an
increase of 360 percent in anti-Semitic incidents in this country. It
was reported earlier this year that there was an exodus of Jewish
families leaving Oakland, California, because of the anti-Semitic
radicalization of the teachers union in that city. This isn't 1930s
Nazi Germany. This is 21st century California where we are seeing this
happen.
If you doubt me, just listen to the leaders of the Democratic Party.
Here is Representative Rashida Tlaib, who said: ``From the river to the
sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful
coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.'' This is an absolute
lie. ``From the river to the sea'' is a call for genocide of the Jewish
people and the destruction of the State of Israel. There is
Representative Tlaib condoning a call for genocide.
Let's not forget about Representative Ilhan Omar, who said: ``We have
seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel,
Afghanistan, and the Taliban.'' Equating the United States, the U.S.
military, and the Israeli Defense Forces to terrorist organizations is
not only disgusting, it is absolutely disgraceful. She also said:
``Israel has hypnotized the world,'' alluding to an anti-Semitic trope
that we have seen for absolutely centuries.
Now, here is Representative Jayapal, as well, who said: ``Well, we
condemn Hamas' firing of those rockets, but I think you have to look at
what prompted even that behavior.''
It is very clear, far-left activists look to their leaders for
direction. The Democratic thought leaders in that party sympathize with
terrorists.
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), my good
friend and the chairman of the Rules Committee.
{time}  1230
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.
I rise today in support of this very important rule. Specifically, I
rise in support of Israel following the attack on Israel by Iran this
past weekend.
This direct attack on Israel is unprecedented. It does mark the first
time that Iran has directly attacked Israel from Iranian soil. In
total, more than 300 drones were launched toward Israel, severely
injuring a 7-year-old girl and damaging a military base.
While the United States worked with longstanding allies to help
assist in the interception of these missiles and drones, it is clear
that the stability of the region is only as strong as the Israeli-
United States partnership.
Understanding this and the gravity of Iran's attack, Republicans have
put forth legislation this week to condemn the attack and reaffirm our
support for Israel. Be assured, Mr. Speaker, Israel does have a right
to self-defense.
This rule and the underlying legislation in the rule reaffirms the
United States' commitment to Israel's security, it designates the
Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization, and it holds Iran
accountable for their support of proxy wars and terrorism in the
region.
Mr. Speaker, it is important that the United States take up these
measures and ensure the safety of Israel and the safety of the United
States. Undeniably, Iran should be held accountable for this attack.
This legislation seeks to do just that.
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the rule from my colleagues.
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Let me just say I have never heard so much B.S. in my life, to be
honest with you. Let me just remind my colleagues that Donald Trump,
the guy they apologize for constantly, is the one who let Iran attack
U.S. troops.
Donald Trump is the one who allowed not one but dozens of Chinese spy
balloons to fly overhead without telling us.
Donald Trump is the one who gave classified Israeli intelligence to
the Russians, intelligence they could have given to Iran.
Donald Trump is the one who went to North Korea--remember that--and
tried to get a brutal dictator to love him. He said, hey, Kim Jong-un
and I are in love.
Donald Trump is the one who tried to extort Ukraine by withholding
our aid, and he was impeached over it.
Donald Trump praises Putin, he fawns over Xi Jinping and Victor
Orban, and he sends Kim Jong-un love letters.
It is pathetic. It is pathetic.
Donald Trump is the one who praised an angry mob who attacked the
United States Capitol and injured people. That is all good for my
friends on the other side.
At every step of the way, Trump stood with America's adversaries and
those who oppose democracy. I am sorry that is an inconvenient truth
for my Republican friends, but it is the truth.
Contrast that with Joe Biden. Joe Biden rallied the world to
Ukraine's defense. He defended our ally Israel in their air space, and
he has rebuilt our image on the world stage and has stood up for
democracy.
My friends on the other side said nothing when the previous President
was apologizing and praising every tin horn dictator in the world who
had no regard for human rights.
Democrats are the party of democracy. Republicans can use whatever
rhetoric they want about the far-left this and the far-left that. Their
party has been radicalized by MAGA extremists.
Here we are at this late date debating legislation that is going
nowhere when, in fact, our allies, specifically Ukraine, is out of
money and out of equipment to defend themselves against Russia, and my
friends just sit there and twiddle their thumbs.
This is pathetic. This is pathetic.
I urge my colleagues to understand what is going on here. We are
doing this exercise that is going nowhere. I do not know who it is
designed to please--maybe to show that we are doing work when we are
not doing work.
We actually passed a bill on Iran--6 months ago to be exact--that is
still here. They never even sent it over to the Senate. This is all for
show. Meanwhile, we have a real crisis on our hands.
I hope my friends will get serious. Let's waste this time doing these
bills that are problematic and that are
[[Page H2409]]
going nowhere, but don't come and lecture us about democracy or about
protecting Israel, about protecting democracy in Ukraine.
It is because of House Republicans that the world right now is on the
brink, and I hope that hopefully in the next couple of days you come to
your senses and allow us to provide relief to our ally Ukraine. I hope
that we do that because if not, it will be too late. You have waited so
long, constantly giving in to the most extreme rightwing elements of
your party, people who have nothing but contempt for Ukraine, for
democratic movements who couldn't give damn about human rights.
It is pathetic that at this late date we are here doing this and not
doing what we should have done a long time ago--and that is provide
Ukraine the assistance it needs to push back on Russia.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds Members to refrain from
engaging in personalities toward presumptive nominees for the Office of
President.
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
You know, there is a lot of emotion coming from the other side of the
aisle, but as a really good friend has told me before, facts don't care
about your feelings. If you look at the facts it is pretty clear the
difference between the Democrats, Obama and Biden, and President Trump.
Let's just look at Russia. It is not a coincidence that Vladimir
Putin moved into Crimea and parts of Georgia when President Obama was
in office, and then for the 4 years President Trump was in office,
there were zero military incursions. Then as soon as Joe Biden took
office, he moves into Ukraine. Actions speak louder than words. Again,
those facts don't care about your feelings.
Let's look at Ukraine. You want to talk about conditioning aid? Joe
Biden conditioned lethal aid on Ukraine, forcing the Ukrainians to fire
a prosecutor that was investigating a corrupt oil and gas company that
Hunter Biden just happened to be on the board of. I will let you draw
your own conclusions on that, but it is very clear that Joe Biden
actually did what President Trump was wrongfully impeached for, and
then he actually bragged about it on TV.
He also had many missteps. Remember at the beginning of the lead-up
to the war, Joe Biden said that we would tolerate a ``minor incursion''
in Ukrainian territory, just whetting the appetite of Vladimir Putin.
Then when the Russians did invade, and Joe Biden slow-walked lethal
aid. Where were the MiGs that were sent? Why didn't we get the
Ukrainians antiaircraft air batteries? Why didn't we jam the electronic
abilities of the Russians to make sure that they didn't have air
superiority?
The Ukrainians still don't have the lethal aid because Joe Biden and
his far-left radical administration slow-walked the aid from the
beginning of this war. It has been an absolute disaster because of Joe
Biden's incompetence and the incompetence of those he surrounds himself
with.
I find it very rich to then attack President Trump's record on
Israel. Who was the first U.S. President to move the Embassy from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem? It was Donald Trump, making him the most pro-Israeli
President we have ever had. Who was it that had the Abraham Accords? It
wasn't Joe Biden. That was President Trump who had the Abraham Accords.
If he was a Democrat, he would have won two Nobel Peace Prizes for
that.
Let's not forget about Joe Biden, who still up to today, is calling
for a ceasefire when our number one ally in the world, Israel, is
fighting for its life against a terrorist organization in Hamas. The
people across the aisle and people in the White House are calling for a
ceasefire on that. I think that is absolutely unacceptable.
For all the talk about supporting our fellow democracies, let me
remind you that there is one thriving democratic state in the Middle
East. There is only one democracy in the Middle East, and that is
Israel. It would be nice if my friends across the aisle would support
that democracy.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.
Langworthy), my good friend.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from
engaging in personalities toward the President.
Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania
for yielding the time today.
I rise today in support of the underlying legislation to put a stop
to the Biden administration's policies of appeasement and stand firmly
with our friend and ally, the great State of Israel.
On October 7, 2023, Hamas--bankrolled by the Iranian regime with
funds that could have been spent on food or medicine or other
humanitarian needs of the Iranian people--murdered and kidnapped
children, they raped women, and they brutalized the elderly. It was
barbarism that the world hadn't seen in years.
The evil we saw on display on October 7 was done at the behest of and
with the resources provided by Iran's fundamentalist leaders. These are
the very same leaders that call for death to Americans, Israelis, and
the extermination of the Jewish state and Jews everywhere. I want to
remind everyone here today that we are still American, and we still
have American and Israeli hostages in Gaza. They are still being held
by a terror group whose lifeline has been and continues to be Iran.
Mr. Speaker, the true cost of the Biden administration's failed
policies of appeasing this terrorist state is on full display. Just
this weekend, Iran launched a full-scale military assault on our ally
with 330 drones, low-flying cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles.
The time for appeasement has long since passed. Let me remind
everyone that President Biden continued to allow Iran to access $10
billion even after they funded the horrific attacks on October 7. It is
ridiculous and frankly disgusting that any of my colleagues would
continue to advocate and to serve as apologists for state sponsors of
terrorism.
In the face of so much aggression in the region, I am relieved to see
that Israel, with the help of the United States, the United Kingdom,
and so many other allies, were able to minimize the damage from Iran's
recent attacks. We would not be at this point if it had not been for
President Biden's relaxing of sanctions and disgraceful attempts at
appeasement in a vain attempt to resurrect the failed Obama-era nuclear
agreement, an agreement that did nothing but empower Iran and its
proxies in the region.
Once again, Mr. Speaker, I am here today on the House floor calling
for this administration and my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle to stop pretending that we can negotiate or appease a regime that
wishes genocide on the Jewish people and the destruction of the State
of Israel.
I strongly support the underlying legislation to put a check on this
administration's reckless policies toward Iran that have jeopardized
the safety of the American people and the survival of our friend and
ally, the State of Israel, as they fight to defend themselves.
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Speaker, listen to the gentleman from New York
(Mr. Langworthy). He got up, and he blamed the President of the United
States more for Iran's attack on Israel than he blamed the supreme
leader of Iran.
It is pathetic. It is pathetic.
I say to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), yes, we
are emotional when we talk about this stuff. We are emotional when we
talk about this stuff because the bottom line is people are dying, and
we have Members on the other side of the aisle who continue to use
Putin's talking points in defending why we are not giving aid to
Ukraine. That is not me saying that. That is the Republican chairman of
the Foreign Affairs Committee.
So, I mean, this is a really important moment here, whether we are
going to stand with our friends in Ukraine, whether we are going to
help them stand up to Russia, or whether following the example of Trump
we are going to turn a blind eye. I mean, Putin is hoping that maybe
Trump wins and the Republicans win because then he knows he can take
over Ukraine.
[[Page H2410]]
Yes, we are emotional because people are dying. Russia has launched a
vicious war against Ukraine, and we are emotional when we talk about
not only protecting Israel but protecting innocent people in Gaza as
well because we actually think human rights matter.
Human rights knows no political party, knows no country's boundaries.
Everyone's human rights ought to be upheld. We are emotional because we
are sick and tired of the rhetoric coming from my Republican friends.
We are sick and tired of them apologizing for Putin all the time or
turning a blind eye on human rights abuses in the Middle East or
anywhere else in the world.
Coming to the floor with bills that my friends know are going
nowhere--I mean, we have done similar bills before that are still being
held at the desk and have not been sent to the Senate. This is all
about show business.
Enough. Enough.
We have an opportunity to come together, put politics aside, and do
the right thing. I hope my friends will join us in that effort.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico
(Ms. Leger Fernandez), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.
{time}  1245
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for
pointing out the importance of the moment we are in and the fact that
there are people dying. There are children dying of hunger. How is it
that we do not cry for that, and that we do not cry for solutions?
Mr. Speaker, I, like all of my colleagues here today, strongly
condemn Iran's heinous and unprecedented drone and missile attack on
Israel over the weekend. We should all be proud of how President Biden,
the United States military, and our allies struck down hundreds of
drones to minimize the casualties and the damage from the attack.
This is the mark of a strong President, bringing our allies together
to combat the threat to democracies around the world. The United States
should lead because we are the strongest when we lead coalitions of
democratic nations.
When the Republican majority scrapped this week's meaningless agenda
of protecting the freedom of refrigerators, we thought this would be
the moment when the Republican House leadership would finally rise to
the challenge of funding the fight against tyranny. This rule, however,
is a disappointment. It is incremental bills with titles condemning
Iran, but the bills themselves, where it counts, the text of the
legislation, does little. Lots of talk in the title but no real
solutions in the bills.
It is especially sad because we have a bipartisan bill that would
provide the bullets that Ukraine needs to defeat Russia, that would
provide the humanitarian assistance that the starving children in Gaza
need to stay alive, that would provide more assistance to Israel, and
that would combat China's increased aggression in the Indo-Pacific.
I know the vast majority of my Republican colleagues want to do the
right thing for Ukraine, but when extreme Putin-protecting Republicans
fail to curb Russia's aggression, they support Iran.
We cannot see these global threats in isolation. Iran's attack on
Israel is tied to the efforts of Russia, Iran, and China to reassert
themselves against the West, against America, and against democracy.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the
March 2024 Breaking Defense article titled: ``'Extremely Concerned':
American generals raise alarm over Iran's tightening ties with Russia,
China.''
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DesJarlais). Is there objection to the
request of the gentlewoman from New Mexico?
There was no objection.
[From Breaking Defense, March 22, 2024]
Extremely Concerned: American Generals Raise Alarm Over Iran's
Tightening Ties With Russia, China
(By Agnes Helou)
Beirut.--As wars rage in Gaza and Ukraine, senior US
military officials sounded the alarm to lawmakers about the
renewed relationships between China, Russia and Iran in both
the Middle East and Africa, suggesting alliances of
geopolitical convenience intertwining the three could
threaten America's position in both regions.
``I'm very concerned about this renewed relationship
between Russia, China and Iran,'' US Central Command head
Gen. Michael Kurilla told a House Armed Services hearing
Thursday. ``What we're seeing is Iran is reliant on China and
Russia is reliant on Iran.''
Kurilla explained that China buys ``90 percent'' of Iran's
oil, which is sanctioned by the U.S. In return, China uses
Iran's influence as part of an effort to ``replace the US as
one of the dominant forces in the Middle East.''
``So in effect, China is funding Iran's subversive and
malign behavior in the region,'' he said.
Iran, meanwhile, has provided thousands of one-way attack
drones to Russia for its war in Ukraine and now has even
``built a factory in Russia'' to produce more locally,
Kurilla said. The general said he couldn't discuss in an open
setting what Russia is providing Iran for this help, but said
that it was ``concerning.''
In his testimony Kurilla didn't get complete the triangle,
but US officials contend that China has provided at least
non-lethal aid to Russia since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine
in February 2022, and just prior to the invasion Russia's
Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping announced a ``no
limits'' partnership.
Earlier this month, Iran conducted maritime exercise with
Russia and China, dubbed as Maritime Security Belt. The
exercise reportedly took place in the North Indian Ocean and
the Sea of Oman.
Similarly US Africa Command chief Gen. Michael Langley said
the US also should be worried about Russian and Chinese
increased footprint in Africa.
``We should be extremely concerned because I would say that
both are very, very much exploitative when possible, but they
are also coercive when necessary,'' he said. ``They're trying
to get what they want. They're trying to replace the West
and, moreover, the United States in our access and influence
across this crucial continent.''
Langley said Beijing and Moscow are offering ``shiny
objects'' to ``our African partners.'' The US counters those
temptations, he said, with a ``hole government approach with
USAID and the State Department'' as well as the military
there.
Back in the Middle East, Kurilla said the region ``faces
its most volatile security situation in the past half
century'' in the wake of Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel,
Israel's massive, deadly counter-attack and the months-long
campaign of Yemen-based Houthis to strike at commercial
shipping targets in the Red Sea.
``The events of [October 7] not only permanently changed
Israel and Gaza. They created the conditions for malign
actors to sow instability throughout the region and beyond,''
Kurilla said.
He added that Iran, which backs Hamas and the Houthis as
well as Hezbollah in Lebanon, has exploited ``what they saw
as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the Middle
East to their advantage.
``Iran has worked for decades to encircle the region with
its proxies. And in the past six months, we have seen every
proxy and the Iranian threat network operationalized in Iraq,
Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, the West Bank, and Yemen,'' he said.
``Iran's expansive network of proxies is equipped with
advanced sophisticated weaponry, and threaten some of the
most vital trade in the world with global and US
implications.''
Kurilla stressed that Iran knows that its ``decade-long
vision cannot be realized if countries in the region continue
to expand integration with each other and deepen their
partnership with United States.''
He said that American ``partners'' in the region ``are
committed to advancing the region, and the United States
remains their partner of choice for now.''
The US leads two operations in the Red Sea: the defensive
Operation Prosperity Guardian, meant to protect ships from
incoming Houthi missiles and drones, and Operation Poseidon
Archer, an offensive series of strikes undertaken along with
the UK on Houthi targets in Yemen. Kurilla said a third
effort is aimed at interdicting Iran's supply of arms to the
Houthis.
Prosperity Guardian's international membership has
fluctuated since its launch in December, but Kurilla said
Thursday it currently has 24 partners, 17 of which were
``public.''
But it's Iran that's the source of much of the problem,
Kurilla said.
``Iran must be compelled to cease their malign behavior and
their actions of directing and supplying funding and training
these proxies,'' he said. ``We want to deny [the Houthi's]
ability to be resupplied. That will take a whole tougher and
actually international effort much like we did with counter
piracy, to be able to go after that because only two ships
can resupply the vast majority of the equipment that we've
destroyed so far of the Houthis.
``We have to stop that we have to increase the
international effort to be able to do the inspections on the
vessels that are going into Hodeidah [port in Yemen],'' he
said. ``We need to isolate the Houthis in the information
environment, we have to impose costs on Iran. So there's
consequences to their behavior.''
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, in the article, the U.S. Central
Command head, General Michael
[[Page H2411]]
Kurilla, says: ``I am very concerned about this renewed relationship
between Russia, China, and Iran. What we are seeing is Iran is reliant
on China and Russia is reliant on Iran.''
We cannot waste another day of precious floor time instead of getting
directly to passing the bipartisan security bill that would actually
hurt Iran. The Senate sent us the security bill 63 days ago. Twenty-two
Senate Republicans voted for that bill. That is as bipartisan as you
will ever get in the Senate.
Instead, we are in a holding pattern, waiting for Republicans to
publicly share the text of bills they promise will provide humanitarian
assistance and support Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, and Israel.
Why should we be waiting? The Senate bill has been available for
review by every office for 63 days.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to put real solutions up
for a vote, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this
rule.
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I guess I should congratulate my friends from across the
aisle for finally realizing there is a link between Russia, China, and
Iran. This has been U.S. foreign policy since at least the early 2000s,
but better late than never, I guess.
I am taken aback by the fact that there is an allegation that Joe
Biden is a strong President because he shot down the drones that Iran
sent into Israel. If the President was strong, drones would not have
been sent to Israel in the first place.
Again, let's not forget that under President Trump, Russia was not
attacking Ukraine and Iran was not attacking Israel. It is the
President's weakness and his policies of incompetence and American
weakness that have invited this aggression.
For the talk about Ukraine, we on this side of the aisle have
intellectual honesty and consistency on this because you can be for
defeating Russia and also for Israel defeating Hamas. You can also be
for holding Iran in check.
It is weird that the same people on the other side of the aisle who
say if you talk about a peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine,
that we are somehow using Russian talking points. Those same people
will be the same ones who say we need to have a cease-fire in Gaza
before the IDF is afforded their God-given right to destroy their
enemy, Hamas. It sounds to me like the talking points of Hamas, but I
will let others draw their own conclusion on that.
Talking about more failures in the Biden administration, let's talk
about the southern border and about how many terrorists have crossed
that southern border.
Since President Biden took office, there have been over 340
encounters at the southern border from individuals who are actually on
the terrorist watch list. Just this month, news broke that a terrorist
from Afghanistan, whose organization is responsible for the deaths of
numerous Americans, was released twice--not once, but twice--into the
interior of the United States after crossing our southern border. He
then roamed around unrestricted for almost a year before he was
captured.
Then earlier this year, a member of Al-Shabaab, which is an al-Qaida
affiliate in Somalia, one of their members was able to live in the U.S.
freely for almost a year, as well.
It is absolutely crystal clear: Biden and radical, extreme leftist
Democrats cannot be trusted to protect our communities and secure the
southern border. The numbers speak for themselves.
Mr. Speaker, talking about incompetence, let's go back and talk about
the surrender of Afghanistan.
Remember, under President Trump, there were zero fatalities for the
last 18 months before Joe Biden took office. Yet, the President, Joe
Biden, felt the need to surrender Afghanistan to the Taliban.
In 2021, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was absolutely the
worst military blunder in my lifetime. The Biden administration
abandoned the Bagram Air Base and released terrorist fighters from
prison, including one that killed 13 servicemembers at Abbey Gate. It
has led to a rise in al-Qaida and ISIS-K. The CENTCOM Commander
testified just last month that ISIS-K will have the capability within 6
months to do external operations against the West.
We know through our OIG reports that President Biden and his failed
bureaucrats in the State Department are funding the Taliban and al-
Qaida through international assistance, but it didn't impact just the
Middle East. This has also emboldened China, Russia, and Iran, the
three countries that Democrats apparently just discovered there is a
connection between in their anti-Western positions.
Reports indicate that the withdrawal helped Putin justify his
invasion of Ukraine. It is just another blunder in a long list of Biden
foreign policy failures.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
Rutherford), my good friend and a sheriff.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. It
is good to stand with him on this very important topic.
Mr. Speaker, I have to tell you, I rise today in strong opposition to
H.R. 4639, which is the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act included
in the rule before us today.
I have to tell you, I am standing shoulder to shoulder here. Although
you don't see them, every major law enforcement agency in this country
is standing with me in this opposition. The Fraternal Order of Police,
Major County Sheriffs of America, Major Cities Chiefs Association,
National Association of Police Organizations, National Sheriffs'
Association, and the list goes on.
I am disappointed to say that the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale
Act truly is one of the most antipolice bills I have seen since I have
been in Congress.
No one's Fourth Amendment rights are being bought. No one's Fourth
Amendment rights are being sold. No one's Fourth Amendment rights are
being violated.
This bill will simply block law enforcement from accessing open-
source, commercially available, lawfully collected data that can help
them solve crimes. It can help them develop probable cause.
Google and Facebook can access this data. The Chinese can access this
data. Cartels and criminals can access this data. But we are not going
to let the police access this data.
Now, my advocates will say: Private citizens and foreign adversaries
can't put you in jail. Well, that may be true. Some of them can
actually do worse to you.
Here is the thing that we need to remember: No one can put you in
jail without probable cause of committing a crime. This is open-source
data. Only law enforcement will be blocked from collecting and
accessing this data.
The bottom line is, the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act will
make communities far less safe, Mr. Speaker.
I adamantly oppose this bill. I will still vote ``yes'' on the rule
because I believe in our process of regular order that gives Members
the opportunity to hear both sides, debate, offer amendments, and,
ultimately, vote a bill up or down. I am absolutely good with that.
Lately, some of my colleagues claim that they want regular order, yet
they vote against regular order time and time again when they join with
the Democrats to take down a rule. Seven times, I think, since I have
been in Congress we have seen these rules go down. It is their way or
the highway, and that is sad.
We promised the American people we would do better. Voting down a
rule is not doing better.
Mr. Speaker, let's pass this rule. Let's pass the bills included in
this rule that will punish Iranian aggression toward our ally Israel.
Then, let's defeat the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, which is
only going to make our communities less safe.
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I think I have heard everything. The gentleman from
Florida just talked about regular order, saying to vote for this rule
because it represents regular order. I mean, he and I have a different
opinion of what regular order is.
There are six bills. Five of them are completely closed rules. Is
that regular order?
[[Page H2412]]
Two of these bills that are closed never went through committee or
never had a markup in committee. Is that regular order?
Boy, I need to send the gentleman a textbook on what regular order
is. This is not what it is.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler) is giving us
lectures about Biden and leadership. I should remind the gentleman that
the Republicans are on their second Speaker of this Congress right now.
If reports are to be believed that were in the newspapers this morning,
you have Republicans wanting to get rid of this Speaker and go on to a
third Speaker.
I mean, please, oh my goodness, lecturing us on leadership?
You are upset that Joe Biden used the U.S. military to help intercept
Iranian missiles into Israel. You say that is a lack of leadership by
President Biden. On the contrary, that is leadership. It is protecting
our ally from missiles from an adversary.
When Donald Trump was President and 109 U.S. troops suffered brain
injuries in a strike by Iran, what was the leadership that the former
President demonstrated? He did nothing, no response. Iran just did it,
and he did nothing. He downplayed it like it was no big deal.
I am sorry, we have a different opinion of what leadership is all
about. The fact of the matter is that we are looking for some
leadership on the other side of the aisle to support Ukraine in their
fight against Russia. I mean, the Senate acted a long time ago, and my
Republican friends continue to do nothing but sit back and scream about
Joe Biden and cover up all of Donald Trump's misdeeds and ignore all of
his weaknesses. Meanwhile, Ukraine is literally at the edge right now.
I mean, this is a strange way of defining leadership. Do you want to
show some leadership? Let's help our ally Ukraine. Let's stop Russia in
its tracks rather than giving comfort to Vladimir Putin.
{time}  1300
Now, I know when the former President was in office, he had a lot of
nice words to say about Vladimir Putin, praised him as this great
friend and this great leader. Then again, the former President also
said he and Kim Jong-un, one of the most notorious dictators in the
world, were in love. How pathetic. How disgusting.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks
to the Chair.
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. Davidson), my good friend and the author of the Fourth
Amendment Is Not For Sale Act.
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to
support this bill.
We all swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. The
Fourth Amendment does not say that if you have nothing to hide, you
have nothing to fear. It says as an American, you have a reasonable
expectation of privacy. It goes on to say that you can have that
privacy infringed upon if there is a probable cause warrant or a
subpoena issued.
What our agencies are doing, though, is they are buying data around
that to avoid having to even get a warrant or subpoena in the first
place.
The Fourth Amendment is Not For Sale Act protects private
information. Public information is not prohibited in any way. Whether
you pay somebody to do the search for you or you do it yourself, public
information is like the plain view doctrine. There is no limitation on
that.
Mr. Higgins is clarifying that. Clay Higgins, one of our colleagues,
has served as a lifetime law enforcement officer. The Judiciary
Committee, where numerous law enforcement officers serve, couldn't
possibly be more pro-law enforcement because they have done the career
themselves, and they have supported this bill out of committee.
To clarify that this bill is for law enforcement, Mr. Higgins has
offered an amendment to say what the intent of the bill is. Automated
license plate readers are there. That information has already been
disclosed to the government. You know you have disclosed it. The
license plate is designed to be a plain-view item in public.
Nothing about this should make policing harder, except that as
Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Justice on the United States Supreme Court,
said: The First Amendment is getting in the way.
Of what? Filtering speech.
If you think that the Fourth Amendment is getting in the way of
enforcing the law, it is designed to. It is supposed to be a limitation
on the ability of government to go after citizens because the
government is entrusted with great powers.
Mr. Speaker, this rule is an important process to getting a vote on
the bill. I thank the leadership team for putting it on the floor
today.
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for
closing.
Mr. Speaker, not one, not one of the bills under this rule, would
prevent Iran from carrying on future attacks, not a single one.
What are we doing here? The answer is simple. Republican leadership
can't organize their clown show of a conference. MAGA members are
playing politics with a global crisis, blaming Joe Biden instead of
Iran, and to top it all off, many of them continue siding with Putin,
an ally of Iran, in his war of aggression against Ukraine.
The people of Ukraine have been bombarded by Iranian drones for
months and months and months, and Republicans have refused to do
anything about it, not a single thing.
Republicans had an emergency Rules Committee meeting. They scrapped
their whole agenda this week to debate these useless bills that we are
talking about right now. There has been nothing for months and months
while the people of Ukraine beg for our help, nothing. In fact, not
only has this Republican majority done nothing, they have Members who
echo Putin's propaganda and mimic Kremlin talking points. You can't
make this stuff up.
What do our allies see when they look at us now? When the Speaker
even mentions potential action to support our allies, extreme MAGA
Republicans threaten to remove the Speaker and shut down Congress
again.
Mr. Speaker, is this the message we want to send our allies when they
need us most? This is shameful. We are at a turning point right now, an
inflection point in human history. Are Iran, Russia, and their allies
going to write the next chapter of the story, or are people around the
world going to stand up and say democracy is worth fighting for? Is
America going to fulfill our obligations and lead the free world as we
have always done and as Democrats want to do, or are we not?
We can't only do it sometimes or when it is politically convenient
for one party or the other. We need to do it all the time. We need to
do it in Ukraine, where people are fighting and dying for their freedom
and begging us for support. It is beyond time we pass something real to
help them.
The bills that we are talking about right now are messaging bills. We
don't even know whether, if they pass, they will even be sent to the
Senate because we have passed bills on Iran before, and they are still
being held up by the House. We haven't sent them to the United States
Senate.
I think people are sick and tired of my Republican friends going
through the motions or making believe like they care about human rights
or making believe that they care about ending the conflict in Israel or
ending the fighting in Ukraine. I think people see through what my
Republican friends are doing. They come to the floor and yell and
scream and blame Biden for every single thing, yet they continue to do
nothing.
This is the last week before we have another break, and it remains to
be seen whether or not there will be a package that comes to the floor
that will actually help Ukraine stand up against Russia.
I get it. There are a lot of Republicans who apologize for Putin and
apologize for Russia; think Russia can do no wrong. The former
President, in all of his meetings with Vladimir Putin, praised him and
praised him and praised him and said they are really good friends. He
doesn't really want us to help Ukraine at all and is imposing all of
these new conditions.
We are running out of time. We either do something now or it is too
late. What a tragedy to basically hand
[[Page H2413]]
Ukraine over to Vladimir Putin, as if that is where he will stop.
This is about human rights. This is about doing what is right. This
is about standing up for the principles that this country is supposed
to be all about. I just hope we do it.
I say to my colleagues: Vote ``no'' on this rule. We are wasting the
time of this Congress. What we need to do is do something concrete
before the end of the week to help Ukraine.
I know it is uncomfortable for my friend from Pennsylvania to hear
that. I know he doesn't want to have to scold some of his Republican
colleagues who would like nothing better than to turn a blind eye while
Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine.
I was in Ukraine. I met with not only Mr. Zelenskyy, but I met with a
lot of average citizens in Ukraine. They are counting on us and the
world community to help them protect their country from invasion. I
hope that we do that. This, what we are doing today, is a colossal
waste of time. That is what we do on a regular basis in this Chamber.
The Republican majority has done a horrific job, and we are now out
of time. Let's hope after we get this rule done and get whatever we are
going to vote on done here, that before the end of the week we can
actually bring a package to the floor that will help save Ukraine from
a Russian invasion.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time
for closing.
Under President Trump's leadership, our Nation was safe and our
adversaries were put on notice. He truly embodied the slogan: Peace
Through Strength.
As President, President Trump destroyed the ISIS caliphate and took
Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and the founder of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi,
off the battlefield.
President Trump refocused our Nation on the Indo-Pacific and the
growing threat of the Chinese Communist Party. He enacted a maximum
pressure campaign on Iran by pulling out of the disastrous Iran deal,
placing significant sanctions on the regime, and used military
deterrence against their proxy networks.
In stark difference to President Biden, the Trump administration
designated the IRGC and the Houthis as foreign terrorist organizations.
When former President Obama failed to enforce his own red line and
allowed chemical weapons to be used against the Syrian people, it was
President Trump who targeted the Assad regime through force.
He also helped bring peace and stability throughout the globe by
negotiating the Abraham Accords, pushed our NATO partners to do their
fair share, and moved our Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He stood up
for the American worker, not the global elite, when he renegotiated
NAFTA, placed tariffs on China, made America energy independent, and
secured our southern border.
In comparison, the Biden administration's foreign policy agenda is
worse than simply a nightmare because it is reality. That is why House
Republicans this week will stand up for our ally Israel and block some
of the disastrous decisions that have helped fund Iran's terrorist
network.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous
question and ``yes'' on the rule. I yield back the balance of my time,
and I move the previous question on the resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further
proceedings on this question are postponed.
