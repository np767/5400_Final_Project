CONGRATULATING SHARON HUGHES FOR 20 YEARS OF SERVICE
(Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and thank
Sharon Hughes for her 20 years of service to the Eighth District of
Ohio.
Sharon was born in Marion, Ohio, and attended Bowling Green State
University. She worked for Congressman John Boehner from 2002 to 2016,
and she has been a dedicated staff member in my office since 2016. She
served as a caseworker and office manager, and also directed the
military academy nomination process with excellence, and the
Congressional Art Competition with excellence as well.
Outside of her congressional work, she also served in several
leadership roles for the Butler Philharmonic Orchestra.
During her 20 years of service to the Eighth District of Ohio, Sharon
has made a difference in the lives of countless constituents, including
assisting in

securing Federal benefits; solving tax return problems; and acquiring
service records, passports, and military service-connected disability
compensation.
I thank Sharon so much for everything that she has done for Ohio's
Eighth District. May she enjoy her well-earned retirement.
