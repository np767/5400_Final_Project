RECOGNIZING STAFF SERGEANT MICHAEL ``MICK'' DeHART
(Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Staff Sergeant
Michael ``Mick'' DeHart for the selfless actions and bravery he showed
on April 10, 1969, during the Vietnam war.
While conducting a routine reconnaissance operation, Staff Sergeant
DeHart and his platoon were ambushed by a numerically superior force.
Throughout the firefight, Staff Sergeant DeHart moved through the enemy
fire to provide cover for injured soldiers, distribute supplies, and
coordinate a counterattack.
As dusk approached, Sergeant DeHart, at significant personal risk,
moved to an exposed position, fired on machine-gun positions and
approaching enemy soldiers, halting their advance. He also aided in the
successful exfiltration of his unit.
For his heroism in combat, Staff Sergeant DeHart recently had one of
his two Silver Stars upgraded to a Distinguished Service Cross.
Thank you, Sergeant DeHart, for your heroism, courage, and service to
our great country.
