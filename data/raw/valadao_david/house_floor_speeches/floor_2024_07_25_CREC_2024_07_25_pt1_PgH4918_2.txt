STOP DOJ WEAPONIZATION
(Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, at this moment, Mrs. Paulette Harlow, a
75-year-old Catholic grandmother, is locked in a Federal prison cell.
Why? For peacefully and prayerfully blocking access to a third-
trimester, late-term abortion mill.
Mrs. Harlow is one of many convicted under the Biden administration
for violating the FACE Act, which prohibits any obstruction to abortion
clinic entrances. For that offense, this wheelchair-bound grandmother
will spend 2 years in jail. Meanwhile, the same prosecutors declined to
prosecute 67 percent of all people charged with a crime in Washington,
D.C., even violent crimes.
At sentencing, the judge mocked her and her faith, demanding that she
``make every effort to stay alive'' as part of the ``tenets of [her]
religion.''
Biden's DOJ is politically weaponizing our justice system through
selective enforcement, disproportionate sentencing, and bigotry.
Congress must stop these political persecutions and help save the lives
of unborn babies.
