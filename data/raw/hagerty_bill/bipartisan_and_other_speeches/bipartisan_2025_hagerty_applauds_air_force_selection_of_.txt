The highly decorated 134th Air Refueling Wing will now enhance its capabilities with the Air Force’s next-generation tanker
WASHINGTON—
Today, United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) released the following statement on the Department of the Air Force’s decision to select McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base as the next Main Operating Base for the KC-46 Pegasus Aircraft:
“I’m proud to recognize that Tennessee’s McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base has been selected as the 7th Main Operating Base for the KC-46 Pegasus Aircraft. This outcome reflects the strong case we’ve made to the Air Force about McGhee Tyson’s readiness and unmatched value. From the start, I’ve pushed hard to ensure Tennessee’s capabilities were fully recognized, including our lowest-cost and mission-ready infrastructure.
“The 134th Air Refueling Wing’s exceptional readiness and 115 percent manpower strength made Tennessee the clear choice for this critical mission. This decision secures more than 1,500 jobs, protects over $200 million annually for our economy, and strengthens America’s air refueling capacity for decades to come.”
