TEAM ALABAMA WORKING TOGETHER
(Mr. CARL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately it often takes tragic events to
bring us all together.
Last week, a tornado ripped through Cottonwood, Alabama, and it
basically destroyed the entire town of about 1,200 people. This
weekend, I had the opportunity to visit with the folks in Cottonwood
and to see how I could help.
Small communities like this don't have the resources that other big
cities have to recover from a storm. The community has to come together
to rebuild their homes and their community, and that is exactly what
Cottonwood is doing. It is very moving to see everyone come together
and to help each other. This is what the Alabama family is truly all
about.
I am grateful today and every day to be part of Team Alabama working
together at the local, State, and Federal level to rebuild our storm-
damaged communities and begin to return to normalcy.
