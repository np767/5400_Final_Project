Senator Justice’s Broadband Strategy Drives Statewide Success
A $250 million Investment of Private, State, and Federal Dollars Makes West Virginia the Top State for Internet Growth Since 2023
WASHINGTON, D.C.
– Today, Senator Jim Justice released a statement highlighting a recent Broadband report that ranks West Virginia as the leading state in the US on internet growth:
“The internet is today’s lifeblood: jobs, investment, and opportunity all come when people are connected and online. My administration worked hand in hand with the West Virginia state legislature to invest in an effort that expanded the state’s broadband connectivity and cut through regulatory red tape. This investment is now bearing fruit as West Virginia leads in broadband connectivity faster than anywhere else in the country. I’m thankful for all those who worked with me to pull the rope together because this is good policy at work: plain and simple,”
