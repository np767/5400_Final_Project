WASHINGTON, D.C.
– Today, Senator Jim Justice released a statement celebrating Toyota’s investment announcement in Buffalo, West Virginia:
“I’ve said time and time again that West Virginia is a diamond in the rough – it’s great to see companies like Toyota start to catch on. This investment in our state to the tune of $453 million will stimulate our economy, bring about new jobs, and is another shining example of what can be done when you mind the store and get the economics right. I was optimistic when I heard this news in our meeting earlier this year, and I’m excited to see Toyota’s words become a reality in our state. Keep it going, West Virginia!”
