Senator Justice Celebrates Eight Years of Roads to Prosperity
WASHINGTON, D.C.
– Today, Senator Jim Justice made a statement celebrating eight years since the beginning of his Roads to Prosperity initiative – an effort that has proven to be a massive success in the state:
“Eight years ago, we made a promise to West Virginians to do something that had never been done before in our state. Roads to Prosperity wasn’t just an idea – it was a belief put into action that our state could dream bigger and build better. The folks of West Virginia are seeing the results of our commitment in every corner of our state. Eight years later, we can say this program was a huge success and has changed West Virginia for the better,”
said Senator Jim Justice.
BACKGROUND:
Roads to Prosperity has
celebrated 1,300 projects
underway or done since its inception in 2017.
Roads to Prosperity was overwhelmingly supported by West Virginians, and the dividends of the initiative are still being seen to this day.
In 2017, Voters overwhelmingly answered the call, with 73% supporting the Governor’s bold plan, which gave rise to the $2.8 billion Roads to Prosperity program.
A
release
from a year ago today highlights investments in:
The Donald M. Legg Bridge.
I-64 widening.
Interstate 70 Bridges.
Corridor H modernization.
West Virginia Turnpike widening.
Renovation of the King Coal Highway.
Coalfields Expressway extension.
Roads to Prosperity also funded smaller bridge, paving, and slide repair projects in every county—many of which might have remained untouched for years without this initiative.
