Senator Justice Votes to End Government Shutdown
WASHINGTON, D.C.
– Today, Senator Jim Justice released a statement following the Senate Republicans successful passage of a bill to re-open the Government:
“This whole episode has been a total wreck for West Virginians and Americans alike. I am happy to see common sense prevail, but it should not take over 40 days of a shutdown to make that happen. I urge the House of Representatives to quickly pass this bill, and encourage my Democrat colleagues to come to the table in good faith as we move forward. We need to put this behind us and get back to the real work of making life better for Americans across the board,”
