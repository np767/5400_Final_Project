Remembering Justice Scalia
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, on February 13, 2016, the Supreme Court
lost one of its Justices, our Nation lost a true legal giant.
Justice Scalia was described by colleagues as ``extraordinary,''
``treasured,'' and ``a stylistic genius.'' Beyond his unwavering
dedication to upholding the originalist viewpoint of the Constitution,
Justice Scalia was also wholeheartedly committed to his family. He was
a husband, father of 9, and grandfather to 36 grandchildren.
His son Paul said of him during his homily:
God blessed Dad with a love for his family. . . . He was
the father that God gave us for the great adventure of family
life. . . . He loved us, and sought to show that love. And
sought to share the blessing of the faith he treasured. And
he gave us one another, to have each other for support.
That's the greatest wealth parents can bestow, and right now
we are particularly grateful for it.
Justice Antonin Scalia was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1986 by
President Reagan and was confirmed by the Senate in a unanimous vote.
While his time on the Court often led to some criticism of his legal
opinions and his very colorful dissents, he remained respected by his
colleagues, even those of the opposite end of the judicial spectrum.
This is a sign of true character--to have an open, honest debate about
a particular issue while respecting the individual person holding an
opinion different from your own.
Justice Scalia said:
I attack ideas. I don't attack people. And some very good
people have some very bad ideas. And if you can't separate
the two, you gotta get another day job.
The sentiment was best portrayed through his friendship with Justice
Ginsburg. As one of his friends, she said:
We are different, but we are one. Different in our
interpretation of written texts. One in our reverence for the
Constitution and the institution we serve. From our years
together on the D.C. Circuit, we were best buddies. We
disagreed now and then, but when I wrote for the Court and
received a Scalia dissent, the opinion ultimately released
was notably better than my initial circulation.
Justice Scalia was known for his wit and his sarcasm in his writings,
famously referring to legal interpretations of his colleagues as
``jiggery-pokery,'' ``pure applesauce,'' and ``a ghoul in a late horror
movie.'' Yet it was these same criticisms that Justice Ginsburg said
nailed the weak spots in her opinions and gave her what she needed to
strengthen her writings.
Justice Scalia represented a consistent, constitutional voice on the
Supreme Court. Just as the Constitution is the pillar of our legal
system, so too is his affirmation to this foundational document of our
Nation. He said:
It is an enduring Constitution that I want to defend. . . .
It's what did the words mean to the people who ratified the
Bill of Rights or who ratified the Constitution, as opposed
to what people today would like.
Justice Kennedy said:
In years to come any history of the Supreme Court will, and
must, recount the wisdom, scholarship, and technical
brilliance that Justice Scalia brought to the Court. His
insistence on demanding standards shaped the work of the
Court in its private discussions, its oral arguments, and its
written opinions. Yet these historic achievements are all the
more impressive and compelling because the foundations of
Justice Scalia's jurisprudence, the driving force in all his
work, and his powerful personality were shaped by an
unyielding commitment to the Constitution of the United
States and to the highest ethical and moral standards.
Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy
Mr. President, with Justice Scalia's passing, we have a vacancy on
the Court to fill.
The question is, When?
I would submit, with only months left until the Presidential
election, that we should let the people decide.
I have heard over and over for the past 7 years that elections have
consequences, but apparently some people seem to only think elections
have consequences on Presidential elections. The American people
elected a brand new Senate in 2014 because of their incredible
frustration with the operation of the previous Senate and because of
the direction that we are now heading under this President.
I have heard this argument for years: The President should be able to
do what he wants. He is the President. But may I remind everyone of a
document in our National Archives called the U.S. Constitution, which
gives divided power to our Nation. The President is not over the
Senate, not over the House, and not over the Supreme Court.
Hyperbole of this has been overwhelming to me in the debate of the
past few weeks. I have heard that unless we replace Justice Scalia
right now, we will ``shut down the court.'' I have heard on this floor
people say that if we don't replace Justice Scalia immediately, it is
``dangerous,'' it is ``unprecedented,'' it is unheard of. I have heard:
``Do your job''--a failure to do your duty. I even heard one Senator
say: ``The Constitution says the President shall appoint and the Senate
shall consent.''
Well, let me show you article II, section 2 of the Constitution where
that comes up. It says that the President ``shall have Power, by and
with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided
two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate''--the
President shall nominate. That is his constitutional responsibility.
But it is not the constitutional responsibility--it never says the
Senate shall give consent to the President. Why? Because the
Constitution gives the role of selecting a Supreme Court nominee in a
50-50 responsibility between the Senate and the President of the United
States.
The President shall nominate; that is his responsibility. But that
only moves forward with the advice and consent of the Senate. There is
no ``shall give consent.'' There is no requirement how it moves.
In fact, Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist Papers, on this very
issue, said that the ``ordinary power of appointment is confided to the
President and Senate jointly.''
This is a 50-50 agreement. What we are facing right now are
incredible attacks on the chairman of the Judiciary
[[Page S1358]]
Committee because he dares to do what Vice President Biden, Senator
Schumer, and Senator Reid recommended years ago. I even heard that we
shouldn't listen to the words of Vice President Biden. I would
understand why people would say that, because when you go back to Vice
President Biden's words, when he was a Senator and chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, in the same spot Chairman Grassley is in now, this
is what, at that time, Senator Biden said. Senator Biden, chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, arguing on this same issue, said: ``Arguing
from constitutional history and Senate precedent, I want to address one
question and one question only: What are the rights and duties of the
Senate in considering nominees to the Supreme Court?''
This is from Vice President Biden--then Senator Biden:
Some argue that the Senate should defer to the President in
the selection process. They argue that any nominee who meets
the narrow standards of legal distinction, high moral
character, and judicial temperament is entitled to be
confirmed in the Senate without further question. . . .
Apparently, there are some in this body and outside this body
who share that view.
I stand here today to argue that opposite proposition.
This is from Vice President Biden. He stated at that time:
We have quashed the myth that the Senate must defer to a
President's choice of a Supreme Court Justice, the men and
women at the apex of the independent third branch of
Government.
Can our Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process,
so wracked by discord and bitterness, be repaired in a
Presidential election year?
Vice President Biden, as Senator Biden, said:
History teaches us that this is extremely unlikely. Some of
our Nation's most bitter and heated confirmation fights have
come in Presidential election years.
The Senate too, Mr. President, must consider how it would
respond to a Supreme Court vacancy that would occur in the
full throes of an election year.
Vice President Biden at that time said this:
It is my view that if the President goes the way of
Presidents Fillmore and Johnson and presses an election-year
nomination, the Senate Judiciary Committee should seriously
consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the
nomination until after the political campaign season is over.
He said, instead:
It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the
political season is under way, and it is, action on a Supreme
Court nomination must be put off until after the election
campaign is over. That is what is fair to the nominee and is
central to the process. Otherwise, it seems to me, Mr.
President, we will be in deep trouble as an institution.
This past week Senator Reid came to the floor to discuss Senator
Grassley and what he is doing, which is exactly what then-Senator Biden
recommended to be done, and he made this statement. Senator Reid said
this past week:
Last Thursday, the senior Senator from Iowa addressed the
Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, which took
place here in Washington. In his speech to them, here is what
Senator Grassley said: ``I feel it's about time that we have
a national debate on the Supreme Court and how it fits in
with our constitutional system of government.''
Then Senator Reid continued:
The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is suggesting that
we reevaluate the Founding Fathers' work, reevaluate the
Constitution of the United States, and change the
Constitution of the United States. Why is Senator Grassley
debating what the Constitution makes clear? The Senate must
provide its advice and consent on nominees appointed by the
President to the Supreme Court. Think of the irony. Justice
Scalia was a strict constitutionalist. Yet now, in the weeks
following his death, Senator Grassley wants to throw out the
Constitution just because President Obama gets to pick
Scalia's replacement.
That is what Senator Reid said this week.
Let's look at what Senator Reid said in 2005 on this exact same
issue. In 2005, on this floor, Senator Reid said: ``The President of
the United States has joined the fray to become the latest to rewrite
the Constitution and reinvent reality.''
This is speaking of President Bush at the time. Senator Reid
continued, ``Speaking to fellow Republicans Tuesday night, two days
ago. He said that the Senate `has a duty to promptly consider each
nominee on the Senate floor, discuss and debate their qualifications
and then give them the up-or-down vote that they deserve.' Referring to
the President's words--duty to whom? The duties of the Senate.'' This
is from Senator Reid in 2005:
The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S.
Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate
has a duty to give Presidential appointees a vote. The fact
was even acknowledged by the majority leader that a vote is
not required. Senator Byrd asked the majority leader if the
Constitution accorded each nominee an up-or-down vote on the
Senate floor. The answer was no. Senator Frist was candid.
The answer was no. The language was not there, Senator Frist
said. He is correct. Senators should read the same copy of
the Constitution Senator Frist had memorized.
Continuing with what Senator Reid said:
It is clear that the President misunderstands the meaning
of the advice and consent clause. That is not how America
works. The Senate is not a rubber stamp for the executive
branch.
So earlier this week, Senator Reid chastised Senator Grassley, saying
he wants to rewrite the Constitution. In 2005 Senator Reid stood on
this floor and encouraged all Members to read the Constitution--that it
nowhere requires that we take an up-or-down vote. So I don't know which
one to take on this--the current statements from Senator Reid or the
previous statements from Senator Reid--because they are in direct
contradiction.
Senator Schumer, on July 27, 2007, speaking about the last 18 months
of President Bush's term as President, said:
For the rest of this President's term and if there is
another Republican elected with the same selection criteria
let me say this: We should reverse the presumption of
confirmation. The Supreme Court is dangerously out of
balance. We cannot afford to see Justice Stevens replaced by
another Roberts; or Justice Ginsburg replaced by another
Alito.
Given the track record of this President and the experience
of obfuscation at the hearings, with respect to the Supreme
Court, at least: I will recommend to my colleagues that we
should not confirm a Supreme Court nominee except in
extraordinary circumstances.
I have also heard: Don't look at the words but the actions. Senator
Reid, Senator Schumer, and, when they were here, Senator Obama and
Senator Biden have all filibustered Supreme Court nominees when they
were Senators--all four of them have. Suddenly, now this is a dangerous
idea that will shut down justice and is completely unconstitutional,
and there are shouts of ``Do your job'' that come from the same Senate
leaders who blocked untold nominations from untold Republican
Presidents and didn't allow amendments on basic bills.
There is a lot of emotion in this body. I get that. There are a lot
of politics in this process. I would hope to bring some facts to light
and to turn down the hyperbole and all the rhetoric. So let me bring
some basic facts to this.
The last time a Supreme Court vacancy arose in an election year and
the Senate approved a new appointee to the Court in that same year was
1932. Since there is no nominee right now, it would not be possible to
fill the vacancy in time for that individual to hear cases in the
spring session of the Supreme Court. That means any nomination selected
now would only be able to serve--in our colleagues' arguments--in the
fall, which is a much shorter session of the Supreme Court, before this
President actually leaves. So we are talking about the final session at
the end of this fall--a very few number of cases.
Justice Stephen Breyer, just a few weeks ago, stated this about the
passing of Justice Scalia:
We'll miss him, but we'll do our work. For the most part,
it will not change.
The Supreme Court is open and is working this week. In fact, the
Court hasn't halted at all. The Court has heard 10 cases already since
Justice Scalia's passing, and they are continuing to release decisions.
It is a myth that there needs to be an uneven number of Justices for
the Supreme Court to actually work. In the past 6 years, 80 percent of
the cases were decided 6 to 3 or greater. So it is a small minority of
the cases that ever get to a 5-to-4 decision. And we don't know that a
5-to-4 would end up not being a 5-to-3 at this point.
Eight members can operate the Court. In fact, the Constitution
doesn't even give a specific number to the Justices. How many Justices
are on the Supreme Court has always been a decision of the President
and the Congress
[[Page S1359]]
together. The first Congress, for example, enacted the Judiciary Act of
1789, which stated the Supreme Court consists of ``a chief justice and
five associate justices.'' If you are counting right, that is six
Justices on the early Supreme Court.
The size of the Court varied during the 19th century, with the Court
shrinking to 5 Justices for a while, following the passage of the
Judiciary Act of 1801, growing to as large as 10 Justices in 1863. Then
in 1869, Congress changed the number to nine, where it has remained.
But the Court doesn't need nine Justices to actually decide a case.
In fact, Congress has established the quorum requirements to be only
six. If the Court ends in a tie decision, 4 to 4, or in the case of six
justices, 3 to 3, the Court will not write an opinion but will affirm
the lower court, or it will ask for a reargument of the case.
In other words, the Court is already set up to function and is
functioning, and it will continue to function with eight people.
I would say what is really happening is that the Democrats, who
implemented the nuclear option while they were leading the Senate and
packed all the lower courts, urgently want to be able to pack the
Supreme Court as well. That will not happen.
We will also not allow a recess appointment, as has been floated
multiple times in the media--the President will just do a recess
appointment and go around us. The Senate chooses when the Senate is in
recess, not the President. So we can do this: We can remain in
continuous session without recess to prevent a recess appointment by
this President through the rest of this year. Many of my Republican
colleagues and I have already agreed to be in Washington every 3 days
for the rest of this year to gavel in this body in pro forma session so
this President cannot put in a recess appointment judge.
Ironically enough, this right of the Senate was approved by the
Supreme Court just a few years ago by a 9-to-0 ruling when this
President tried to force in new members on the National Labor Relations
Board through a recess appointment, and this Supreme Court kicked those
out, saying the President cannot choose when the Senate is in recess.
Our Nation faces really big issues: accelerating debt, threats from
terrorism, a struggling economy, major education, and health care
reform issues. This is a moment when the people of the United States
should speak about the direction of our Nation. We are still a nation
of the people, by the people, for the people. And for the next
President and for the next Supreme Court nomination, we should let the
people decide.
With that, I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so
ordered.
Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, last month we all learned with great
sadness of Justice Antonin Scalia's passing after nearly 30 years on
the Court. He would have turned 80 years old on Friday, March 11.
In recent weeks, foremost on people's minds as they reflect on
Justice Scalia's legacy and his life is his dedication to the letter of
the law, his respect for constitutional and statutory text, his view
that the U.S. Constitution is a sacred document which must be read and
adhered to.
His decisions and opinions were aimed to follow the Constitution
wherever it took him, even if it may not have been to a place where he
would agree politically. Justice Scalia not only understood the
importance of not legislating from the bench, but he also cared deeply
about the lesson being taught by the work of the Court. Through his
writings, his opinions, including his dissents, he taught us great
lessons.
Now all of this is very important and relevant, ironically, as we
consider our role and path forward in the decision to fill his vacancy.
Instead, unfortunately, we have seen rhetoric and arguments which fly
in the face of that dedication to the text, to the Constitution, to
statutory law and rules, and following that letter.
My esteemed Democratic colleagues have taken to the Senate floor, and
they have encouraged outside groups to storm committee rooms--all
arguing that somehow there is a legislative or constitutional mandate
that the Senate have hearings, take a vote now, and not allow the
American people to weigh in through the election. They argue that
somehow the Senate is constitutionally obligated to hold hearings and
vote right now before the election, but as Justice Scalia would surely
point out: Read the text. Look at the Constitution. Look at all
relevant statutes and rules. That is not the case. It is clear,
otherwise. In fact, it is crystal clear. So let's do that in homage to
Justice Scalia.
He wrote many opinions arguing for exactly what I am saying: Read the
clear language that is at issue--either the Constitution or a statute
or whatever is at issue. He wrote opinions against what before his time
was rampant use of so-called legislative history, looking at the
history of how a law was passed really to give people fodder to make it
up as they go along and reach almost any conclusion and interpretation
they want to. Justice Scalia taught us--and he had a real impact on the
Court through his decisions--that we need an unwavering commitment to
principle and respect to statutory text as written.
As he often said in so many different ways, ``Legislative history is
irrelevant when the statutory text is clear.'' In one opinion he noted
that ``if one were to search for an interpretive technique that, on the
whole, was more likely to confuse than to clarify, one could hardly
find a more promising candidate than legislative history.'' He said
directly that ``our cases have said that legislative history is
irrelevant when the statutory text is clear.''
Again, that is a big part of his legacy and very relevant in this
discussion about how the Senate should fulfill its duties. Let's look
at the text of the Constitution and any relevant text like our rules
below the Constitution.
In the U.S. Constitution, article II, section 2, clause 2 says
clearly: The President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and
Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public
Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other
Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein
otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law.''
That is what it says on the issue. That is all it says on the issue.
Those words are straightforward, and those words do not mandate a
hearing or a vote in any certain timeframe. It is very clear from the
Founders and from numerous Court decisions since then that within the
constraints of those words, the Senate sets its rules of how to proceed
on all Senate matters, including confirmations. So another very
important and very clear text that we should read word for word and
adhere to are the standing Senate rules. Senate rule XXXI states:
``When nominations shall be made by the President of the United States
to the Senate, they shall, unless otherwise ordered, be referred to
appropriate committees; and the final question on every nomination
shall be, `Will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?'
which question shall not be put on the same day on which the nomination
is received, nor on the day on which it may be reported by a committee,
unless by unanimous consent.''
It only says when the vote cannot be taken. It doesn't say that a
hearing has to happen or a vote has to be taken within a certain amount
of time.
Another part of rule XXXI is even more direct on this point:
``Nominations neither confirmed nor rejected during the session at
which they are made shall not be acted upon at any succeeding session
without being again made to the Senate by the President.''
So this is even more direct and makes crystal clear that there is no
requirement of a hearing or a vote on any particular nomination in any
particular timeframe during a session. Again, that is very
straightforward, very crystal clear, but the Congressional Research
Service has a report which validates and confirms the obvious. Upon
their review of all of this text, they say:
A committee considering a nomination has four options. It
can report the nomination to
[[Page S1360]]
the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation,
or it can choose to take no action.
So they say the obvious from reading the relevant text. Those are the
options. There is no requirement for a hearing or for a vote within any
certain timeframe.
There are other ``authorities''--I will put that in air quotes--which
confirm this view, and ironically those authorities I am referring to
are Democrats who are taking exactly the opposite view now. When the
shoe was on the other foot, time and time again, they said: There is no
requirement to move forward on any certain timeframe.
The minority leader, Harry Reid, said: ``Nowhere in [the
Constitution] does it say the Senate has a duty to give Presidential
[nominees] a vote. It says appointments shall be made with the advice
and consent of the Senate. That is very different than saying every
nominee receives a vote.'' That is a direct quote.
In June of 2003, Senator Patrick Leahy--he is significant because he
is ranking member of the Judiciary Committee--said clearly:
The Constitution divides the appointment power between the
president and the Senate. It expects senators to advise the
President, not just rubber stamp his choices. It says advise
and consent, not nominate and rubber stamp.
Even further back, in June of 1992, then-Chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, now-Vice President Joe Biden argued for the need to set
aside partisanship and work to bring unity forward in the Senate by
saying: ``President Bush should consider following the practice of a
majority of his predecessors and not name a nominee until after the
November election is completed.'' He said that during a Presidential
election year, just like we are in the midst of a Presidential election
year right now.
Chuck Schumer, another leader of the Judiciary Committee, said much
the same thing in the past, making crystal clear that there is no
requirement--in fact, he said 18 months before the expiration of
President Bush's term. So not during his last year, but 18 months
before the end of that term that the Senate shouldn't confirm any Bush
nominee, except in extraordinary circumstances.
It is very clear from their own words that there is no obligation to
use any certain timeframe to have any absolute committee hearing or
vote within a certain period of time. So then the question is, What is
the best thing to do for the American people? I firmly believe the best
thing to do for the American people is to put the American people in
charge, to put them in the lead, to maximize their role, their power,
and their vote. That is what the opportunity of a major Presidential
election gives us.
Of course, if you have a vacancy early on in the term of a President,
you are not going to have another big election for some time, but that
is certainly not the case right now. We are in the midst of a huge
election with enormous consequences for the future, and it is very
clear the choices--whatever the final two choices may be--would offer
very different options in terms of the type of Supreme Court Justice
they would appoint.
I think we best serve the American people in almost all cases--
certainly in this case--by maximizing their voice, their role, and
their power. They often feel absolutely shunned, put to the side,
ignored by Congress, by Washington now. We need to put them in charge,
and in this Presidential election year we have a unique opportunity do
that. That certainly is what I am committed to doing.
I can tell you, as I travel Louisiana, the huge majority of my fellow
citizens whom I have talked to agree with that approach. I just
finished doing four townhall meetings in all different parts of the
State. In a few weeks I am going to do four more, all different parts
of the State. That is not a scientific survey, but nobody came to those
townhall meetings who didn't agree with that path forward. A great
majority of calls and emails and letters from my fellow Louisiana
citizens on this issue absolutely confirm and support that path
forward.
Let's put the American people in charge. They are crying for a voice.
They are crying with frustration over not being listened to by
Washington. This is a major decision. Let's put them in charge. Let's
let them lead in this Presidential election year on this very important
issue.
Of course, whoever is elected, the next President will have a big
impact on our country. That person will serve for 4, maybe 8 years and
make decisions that are enormous on a whole host of issues, but this
appointment to the Supreme Court could have an even more lasting
impact, could have an impact for decades to come, and it is even more
important in that frame of mind, in that viewpoint, to put the American
people in charge, to maximize their role and their voice about what
direction we should take.
So many Louisianians feel as I do. The Court has strayed from Justice
Scalia's proper philosophy of actually reading the Constitution and
reading statutory text and applying it as written. So many Louisianians
feel as I do; that they are making it up, in many cases, as they go
along; that they are legislating from the bench; that they are using
clever techniques, such as looking to legislative history--something
Justice Scalia, as I noted, railed against--as ammunition to get to
whatever endpoint they desire to get to. That is not the role of any
court, certainly not the role of the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court should apply the Constitution and the law as
written, not make it up as they go along, not legislate from the bench,
not get to some political endpoint through clever legal arguments--just
as we in understanding our role should read the Constitution, should
read the Senate rules and not suggest what is clearly not the case;
that somehow there is a mandate to have a hearing, to have a vote in
some set period of time.
I urge my colleagues to put the American people in charge. This is a
big decision, and I think we will do far better putting them in charge
than allowing some insider Washington game to control and manipulate
the process without hearing their voice, which we have every
opportunity to properly hear through this important election this year.
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am so pleased we are making strong
progress on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and I hope we
will get this bill done within a day. It is very important, especially
to States with rural areas, such as the Presiding Officer's and mine,
and I am glad we are starting to make headway.
U.S.-Canada Relations
Today, Mr. President, I am here to talk about something else, and
that is the importance of the U.S. relationship with Canada. Senator
Crapo and I cochair the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group
and have been working in the trenches on everything from softwood
lumber, to the Detroit-Windsor bridge crossing, to issues of
intellectual property, to dairy, to beef, and with the arrival of Prime
Minister Trudeau, this work has suddenly gotten a little more
glamorous. We are excited about that and excited about the Nation's
newfound interest in our important relationship with Canada. In fact,
Canada is one of our largest trading partners. There is so much
business that goes on between the Presiding Officer's State and Canada,
as well as my State and Canada. Prime Minister Trudeau is bringing a
newfound interest in this work.
Many of our two countries' priorities, which include national
security, infrastructure, and energy, align closely. During this visit,
I expect our relationship will deepen, and we will hear more about how
our two nations will work together on our shared priorities. We hope
they will discuss hockey, which is something that is very important to
Minnesota and Canada. A number of our hockey players have actually come
from Canada, and a number of the Canadian hockey players have come from
Minnesota. But we think there are other important topics as well.
[[Page S1361]]
First, I will start with our economic relationship--a relationship
that supports 9 million U.S. jobs. Canada purchases more goods from
America than any other nation. If you asked people what country in the
world is the biggest purchaser of U.S. goods, I think they might not
predict that the answer is Canada. Canada is the No. 1 buyer of goods
produced in 35 out of 50 States, including Minnesota. Last year
Canadians bought $376 billion worth of goods made by American
businesses, and it is a two-way street. The United States imports more
than $300 billion in Canadian goods every year.
Over the years, to enhance this relationship, we have taken many
important steps to improve the flow of travellers and goods across our
common border. In the wake of September 11, we created a U.S. passport
card, which is a secure but less expensive and more convenient
alternative to a traditional passport. We removed unnecessary double
screening of luggage--a bipartisan bill I passed with Senator Roy Blunt
of Missouri--and then expanded the number of preclearance airports,
which allows American security personnel to be in those airports. I
think we are up to eight now.
We have agreed to build a new bridge connecting Windsor, Ontario, and
Detroit, MI. It is a source of great concern. The bridge that is there
now is privately owned and has huge lines. It is not a very good
situation. So a new bridge is in the works, and we are very excited
that our two countries worked on that together.
I especially want to acknowledge Ambassador Doer, the longtime
Ambassador from Canada to the United States who worked on that with our
two Ambassadors. I also want to acknowledge the newly named Canadian
Ambassador, Ambassador David MacNaughton, who will continue the strong
diplomatic relations between our countries.
Our national security partnership is also incredibly important. We
share the longest border in the world with Canada. Obviously border
issues are important, but more than that, Canada, as part of NATO, has
worked with us not only in Afghanistan, where they supplied many troops
and now provide funding there, but they are also on the frontline with
ISIS. They actually have hundreds of trainers working on the frontline
there. I would be remiss not to mention them standing up to Russian
aggression in Ukraine. Believe it or not, Canada has a major Ukrainian
population, and they have been our friend in dealing with Ukraine as
well.
Prime Minister Trudeau has also been a leader in welcoming refugees
to the country. Right after his election, he showed up at the airport
to greet Syrian refugees. It was not just a symbol; they actually
brought in 25,000 Syrian refugees during the last year and are expected
to take in 10,000 more this year, which is significantly more in total
than the United States has been able to bring in. We know the vetting
process is incredibly important, but we do want to thank Canada for
taking part in what is a travesty internationally.
They are working on combating Ebola with initiatives such as Power
Africa and are also working with us on the climate change numbers.
By the way, our two countries are working together with Mexico. We
have formed a very powerful trading block, and we want to encourage
that with our standards and other things that we do in terms of
building electrical capabilities to allow us, as a North American
block, with a new day in North America, which was agreed to among the
three Presidents of countries in the last 2 years, to compete in the
block in an increasingly competitive global economy, including
harmonizing emission standards and doing other work together.
As one of the cochairs of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary
Group, we welcome the new Prime Minister to Washington. When I was
sworn in as a U.S. Senator in 2013, my friends and colleagues
celebrated at the Canadian Embassy. I am the first person I have found
to have my swearing-in at the Canadian Embassy, but I chose it to make
a point--that we should not forget one of our best trading partners.
For years it was the only Embassy draped in banners that read
``friends, neighbors, partners, allies.'' So many other countries do
not acknowledge their friendship with the United States in a way that I
think they should. Canada doesn't hide it. Canada is proud of it. And
we welcome the Prime Minister today.
I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.

[[Page S1362]]
Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the opening words to the preamble of the
Constitution of the United States are familiar to all of us: ``We the
People.'' But what do those words mean?
It was ``the People'' who established the U.S. Constitution. We
established, among other things, the Senate in article I, section 1, of
the Constitution. It is for ``the People'' that my colleagues and I,
along with every other public official across these United States, now
serve.
And it was on behalf of ``the People'' that the Constitution
established ``one supreme Court,'' consisting of judges appointed ``by
and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.''
Since the tragic passing of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, there
has been a great deal of debate about this particular provision of the
Constitution. But there should be no controversy. The text of our
founding charter is clear.
The President has full and complete power to nominate individuals to
the Supreme Court, and the Senate has full and complete power to reject
or confirm the nominee. It is as simple as that. Indeed, the Senate
retains complete discretion with respect to whether it should even
consider--much less accept or reject--Presidential nominees.
This should not be controversial. It is how virtually every student
of the Constitution--and how nearly every Member of Congress--has
understood the Senate's power of advice and consent for the past 228
years since the Constitution was ratified.
Senator Harry Reid said in 2005: ``Nowhere in that document does it
say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote.''
Senator Pat Leahy in 2003 acknowledged that the power of ``advice and
consent'' included the power to withhold consent.
Then-Senator Joe Biden in 1992 argued from the floor of this Chamber
that the Senate should refuse to consider a Supreme Court nominee until
the people had spoken in the upcoming Presidential election.
But now, with the Presidential election in full swing, some of my
friends on the other side of the aisle maintain that the opposite is
true. Some argue instead that the Senate is constitutionally obligated
to hold hearings and to vote on any candidate President Obama might
eventually nominate to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. I
respectfully dissent.
If this a-textual and a-historical account of the Constitution were
accurate--and it is not, but if it were--then prior Senates violated
the Constitution when they did not cast up-or-down votes on Supreme
Court nominees. Even the Standing Rules of the Senate would be
themselves suspect under this theory, contemplating as they do that
``[n]ominations neither confirmed nor rejected during the session at
which they are made shall not be acted upon at any succeeding session
without being again made to the Senate by the President. . . . ''
Neither does the prospect of a temporary eight-member Supreme Court
raise any significant constitutional concern or even any significant
pragmatic concern for the Supreme Court of the United States.
For instance, during the Supreme Court's 2010-to-2011 term, the Court
decided over 30 cases with 8 or fewer Justices participating, almost
entirely as a result of recusals arising, as they often do in this
circumstance, from Justice Kagan's nomination. Similarly, following the
retirement of Justice Powell in 1987, the Court acted on 80 cases with
8 or fewer Justices. In short, the sky does not fall when the Court
operates with only eight Justices. As Justice Breyer recently stated,
the work of the Court ``[f]or the most part . . . will not change.''
Now, we have to remember that any Supreme Court nominee made by
President Obama would not be seated until weeks before the people
choose the next President. Let me explain what I mean by that. Even if
the President of the United States were to nominate someone today to
serve on the Supreme Court of the United States to replace Justice
Scalia, using historical averages, under any calculation of the amount
of time that it typically takes to confirm a Supreme Court Justice,
that confirmation could not be completed until after the Supreme Court
is scheduled to have heard its last oral arguments for this term--the
term that began in October of 2015. What does that mean? Well, it means
that for the rest of this year, the Justice couldn't participate in
cases being argued this year. What that also means is that by the time
the Court resumes its work and begins its next session starting in
October of this year, we would be just weeks before the next
Presidential election. Yet that would be the first moment at which any
newly confirmed Justice would start hearing cases being argued before
the Court--cases being argued on their merits for consideration before
the Court--just weeks before the next Presidential election.
Consider also that since the nomination of Justice Scalia to the
Supreme Court in 1986, nearly 30 years ago, it has taken more than 70
days, on average, for the Senate to confirm or reject a nominee after
that nominee has been submitted to the Senate for its advice and
consent.
So, again, based on that historic average, even if the President
nominated somebody today and assuming that nominee were confirmed, that
individual would not be seated in time to hear or rule on any of the
cases the Court is considering on the merits for its docket this year,
and that would, of course, mean that the next time arguments were
heard, the first time this particular Justice could participate in such
arguments on the merits before the Court would be just weeks before the
Presidential election.
This is a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land--a
Court that considers not only the interpretation of Federal laws,
statutes, and regulations in operation within the Federal Government,
but also the very meaning of the Constitution itself. In light of the
fact that this is a lifetime appointment to that Court and in light of
the fact that the people are about to speak this November to decide who
ought to occupy the Oval Office, we should, in respect and deference to
the people of this great country, wait until the American people have
spoken. They deserve a voice.
In my view, the future of the Supreme Court is now at stake, and the
election for our next President is also, of course, well underway
already. So it is the people who should determine what kind of Supreme
Court they wish to have.
Now, the President is entitled, of course, to discharge his own
constitutional authority to nominate. No one can take that from him.
That belongs to him. But the Senate is equally entitled to withhold
consent and to protect the people's voice. We have to remember that it
was considered at the Constitutional Convention the possibility that
the Senate would itself have the exclusive power to nominate executive
branch officials. It was also suggested that the Senate be given a veto
power over the President's appointment prerogative. Neither of those
ended up in the Constitution. Instead, what ended up in the
Constitution, based, I believe, on the Massachusetts Constitution, was
a shared power--one in which the President has the power to nominate
but does not have the power to appoint, unless or until such time as
the Senate chooses to grant its advice and consent and thereby confirm
a nominee put forward by the President.
As James Madison wrote in The Federalist Papers, ambition must
counteract ambition, and the people should decide.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, there is a vacancy on the most important
Court in America, and the message from Senate Republicans is crystal
clear: Forget the Constitution. It doesn't matter who President Obama
nominates because the Republicans will allow no votes on that nominee.
They will hold no hearings on that nominee.
Their response to one of the most solemn and consequential tasks that
our
[[Page S1363]]
government performs--the confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice--will
be to pretend that that nominee and President Obama himself simply do
not exist--cannot see them, cannot hear them.
At the same time they are blocking all possible Supreme Court
nominees, Senate Republicans are in a panic because their party seems
to be on the verge of nominating one of two extremists for President--
two candidates who think nothing of attacking the legitimacy of their
political opponents and demeaning millions of Americans, two candidates
whose extremism, Republicans worry, will lead their party to defeat in
November.
These are not separate issues. They are the same issue. If Republican
Senators want to stand up to extremists running for President, they can
start right now by standing up to extremists in the Senate. They can
start by doing what they were elected to do right here in the Senate.
They can start by doing their jobs.
The refusal of the Republican Senators to execute the most basic
constitutional duties of their office is shocking, but it is not new.
Article II, section 2 of the Constitution says that the President of
the United States ``shall nominate'' judges, executive officials, and
Justices to the Supreme Court with the ``Advice and Consent of the
Senate.'' There is no secret clause that says ``except when that
President is a Democrat,'' but for 7 years that is how Republicans in
the Senate have acted. Since the first day of the Obama Presidency,
Republican Senators have bowed to extremists who have rejected the
Obama Presidency and abused the rules of the Senate in an all-out
effort to cripple his administration and to paralyze the Federal
courts. The Constitution directs Senators to provide advice and consent
on the President's nominee, and every Senator swore an oath to uphold
the Constitution. If Senators object to a nominee's qualifications,
they can vote no and they can explain themselves to the American
people. President Obama and I are members of the same political party,
but I haven't agreed with every single nomination he has made, and I
haven't been shy about it. That is how advice and consent works. Learn
about the nominee and then use your best good-faith judgment about
their qualifications, but Republican extremists aren't voting against
individuals based on a good-faith judgment about a specific person. No.
They are blocking votes wholesale in order to keep those jobs vacant
and undermine the government itself.
For years Republicans have executed a strategy to delay votes on
confirming government officials across the board. In 2013, only 1 year
into President Obama's second term, Republican leaders flatly rejected
his authority to confirm any judges to fill any of the three open seats
on the second highest court in the country, and Democrats had to change
the filibuster rules in order to move those nominees forward. Once
Republicans took over the Senate in 2015, judicial confirmations nearly
ground to a halt.
It is not just judges. For months after the President won reelection,
Republicans held up his nominees to run the Department of Labor and
Environmental Protection Agency, largely on the suspicion that those
highly qualified individuals might actually help those agencies do
their work. For years Republicans held up nominees to the National
Labor Relations Board--even Republican nominees--in order to cripple
the ability of that 80-year-old agency to resolve disputes between
workers and their bosses. For years Republicans held up the President's
choice to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, refusing to
confirm anyone unless the President would agree to gut the agency.
Republicans regularly hold up the confirmation of dozens of
Ambassadors, undermining our national security and our relationships
with other nations. Last year Republicans blocked confirmation of the
Attorney General, the highest law enforcement official in this
country--blocked her for 166 days--longer than it took the Senate to
consider the prior seven Attorneys General combined.
For more than a year the Republican chairman of the Banking Committee
hasn't held a single vote on any of the 16 Presidential nominees
sitting on his desk, not even nominees who are critical to maintaining
the financial stability of this country or the ones who are responsible
for choking off the flow of money to ISIS.
The message couldn't be clearer. No matter how much it damages the
Nation, no matter how much it undermines the courts, no matter whether
it cripples the government or lays waste to our Constitution, Senate
Republicans do pretty much everything they can to avoid acknowledging
the legitimacy of our democratically elected President. For too long
the Republicans in the Senate have wanted to have it both ways. They
want to feed the ugly lies and nullify the Obama Presidency while also
claiming they can govern responsibly. Well, that game is over.
Candidates motivated by bigotry and resentment, candidates unable to
govern, candidates reflecting the same extremism that has been nursed
along for 7 years right here in the U.S. Senate are on the verge of
winning the Republican Party's nomination for President.
Now Republican Senators must make a decision because here is the
deal: Extremists may not like it, but Barack Obama won the Presidency
in 2008 by 9 million votes. He won reelection in 2012 by 5 million
votes. There were no recounts and no hanging chads, no stuffing the
ballot box or tampering with voting machines, no intervention by the
U.S. Supreme Court. No. President Obama was elected the legitimate
President 7 years ago, and he is the legitimate President right now. So
if it is true that some Republican Senators are finally ready to stand
up to the extremism that denies the legitimacy of this President and of
the Constitution, I say to you: Do your job. Vote for a Supreme Court
nominee. Do your job. Vote on district court judges and circuit court
judges. Do your job. Vote on Ambassadors. Do your job. Vote on agency
leaders and counterterrorism officials. If you want to stop extremism
in your party, you can start by showing the American people that you
respect the President of the United States and the Constitution enough
to do your job right here in the U.S. Senate.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so
ordered.
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to address the
responsibility of the Senate in its advice and consent role under the
Constitution. Of course, the President's duty is to nominate a Justice
when the vacancy exists for a Justice, and that responsibility is very
clearly written into our Constitution. The Constitution also very
clearly conveys the Senate's role in providing advice and consent. This
is the vision of our founding document. Actually, our Founding Fathers
wrestled with exactly how to best construct this nomination and
confirmation process. They knew there had to be a way to appoint judges
in the judiciary and certainly ambassadors and directors in the
executive branch, how to go about that. In those early efforts to craft
the Constitution, some argued that this responsibility should be with
the Executive, with the President; others argued that, no, no, it is
better given to the assembly, to the body. Well, that conversation went
back and forth. We can read a little bit about the thinking through
Alexander Hamilton's The Federalist Papers 76 because he laid out the
conversation as it went back and forth. They recognized that there were
certainly advantages to having the President make the appointments.
I quote from Alexander Hamilton's paper:
The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will
naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact
regard to reputation. He will under this account feel himself
under stronger obligations and more interested to investigate
with care the qualities requisite to the stations to be
filled.
In short, direct your accountability to one individual who would be
responsible for carrying that out.
But they were also concerned about some disadvantages of the
Executive
[[Page S1364]]
making appointments. Giving absolute power of appointment to the
President could lead to unwarranted favoritism, as it was put, or
incompetence in those appointed.
Well, then again they thought, how about the assembly? They recognize
that you have certainly a rich makeup of views in an assembly and
perhaps that could be of value. On the other hand, they also felt that
there would be a lot of horse-trading over appointments and that they
would just never get the job done, and indeed, as Hamilton noted, ``the
intrinsic merit of the candidate will be too often left out of sight.''
So that was the dilemma, and they came up with a strategy to take the
strength of the Executive and the strength of the assembly;
specifically, that you would indeed have the power invested in one
person, and of course the Executive, in creating nominations for the
executive branch, wanted to make sure those--there was an inherent
desire to make sure those folks were competent, but there was also
still this concern about, what if there was too much favoritism and
what if individuals of unfit character were appointed to the bench? So
give the Senate the chance to review and provide consent or, as
Hamilton wrote, ``to prevent the appointment of unfit characters.''
That is what it boiled down to. So the strength of the Executive and
the strength of the Senate combined in order to solve this knotty
problem of how you filled the key posts in the judiciary and the key
posts in the executive.
All of this led to the exact crafting of article II, section 2, of
the Constitution. It referred that the President--``and he shall
nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall
appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the
supreme Court,'' and so on and so forth. Of course, this isn't, when
there is a vacancy, the President can if he or she desires; no, it is
shall. This is a responsibility. You have to fill the position. So the
President has an obligation under this clause, and we in the Senate
have an obligation to follow up with the advice and consent function.
That is where we stand and why this esteemed Chamber has operated now
throughout the more than 200-year history in providing that check and
balance on the Executive. It is the President's responsibility to
nominate, and it is our responsibility to vet those nominees, to
examine them, to see if they have the fit, the characteristics of both
their own qualifications and their character. That is the basis:
qualifications and character. That is the question that we have
addressed in this Chamber century after century.
But here we are today with a unique circumstance in which the
leadership of this body has said: We are not going to fulfill the
responsibility that is given to us under the Constitution. We are going
on strike. We don't want to do our job.
I think the American people are saying the opposite: Senate, do your
job. Senate, you were assigned a job in the Constitution. Senators, you
signed an oath to abide by that Constitution. You have a responsibility
under the vision of our Government to make it work. You have a
responsibility to fulfill that job, to do that job.
The Supreme Court is only the latest manifestation of the challenges
we have had with nominations for the executive and for the judicial. I
hope we can come together and develop a much more rapid system of
vetting nominees and, if there is not a major objection, having those
at lower levels essentially conveyed quickly into their posts, because
this is something that we know will be the case.
We know that over time, there will be Republican administrations and
there will be Democratic administrations. We know that under the vision
of three co-equal branches of Government, it is not the role of
Congress to systematically undermine the other two branches. That was
not the design of our Constitution. So we wield a particularly sacred
responsibility not to use our partisan inclinations as a tool to try to
destroy the Presidency of a different political party or to pack,
basically, the courts according to our own philosophy. We are not doing
that now. As a body, we are failing our responsibility.
The Constitution says: Do your job. The people of America say: Do
your job. The leadership here in the Senate is saying: We refuse to do
our job. That is just wrong.
Our Court does play this critical role in making sure that our laws
and regulations stay within the bounds of the Constitution. It is not
since the Civil War that the Supreme Court has been left with a vacancy
of more than a year. The Civil War is a very unique circumstance. Since
the 1980s, every person appointed to the Supreme Court has been given a
prompt hearing and a vote within 100 days. Since 1975, it has taken on
average only 67 days to confirm Supreme Court nominees.
We can look at the list: Justice Kagan, 88 days; Justice Sotomayor,
67 days; Alito, 83; Roberts, 63; Breyer, 74; Ginsburg, 51; Thomas, 99;
Souter, 69; and, on through the list, Kennedy, 65; Scalia, who just
passed away, 85; and Rehnquist, 89.
You notice that these are nominations by both Democratic Presidents
and Republican Presidents. And in each case, the Senate--regardless of
the party in control of the Senate--did their job, vetted these
nominees, held a vote on them, and proceeded. But now we have more than
317 days still left in this administration, and the leadership of this
body is saying that they are not going to do their job for 317 days.
They are not going to meet with a nominee, not going to hold a
committee meeting on the nominee, not going to report that to the
floor, not going to hold a floor debate--not because of the standards
set up in the Constitution, not because of this standard: Is this a fit
character? Is he or she fit by qualifications? Is he or she fit by
judicial temperament? The standard of unfit character--no, this is a
strike, a job strike based solely on partisan politics. This is
bringing partisan politics into the very place it should never be--
confirmation of our judges not at 100 days but more than 300 days,
which is totally out of sync with the history of this Nation, totally
out of sync with the responsibility that each of us is assigned to help
provide advice and consent.
More than a dozen Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed in the
final year of a Presidency. I want to emphasize that because there have
been folks here in the Chamber who have said: Well, there should be
some special rule. In fact, they even thought there was some special
rule that you don't confirm a Supreme Court Justice in the final year
of a Presidency.
That simply is not the case. More than a dozen Justices have been
confirmed in the final year of a Presidency. Most recently, Justice
Kennedy was confirmed in the last year of President Reagan's final
term. It was not a Republican-led Senate that did that confirmation. It
was a Democrat party-led Senate that did that confirmation because the
Democratic Party leadership and Members said: This is not partisanship.
This is a responsibility we have, and we are going to execute it.
But, unfortunately, we are hearing a very different story at this
moment from the Republican leadership in this body, and it is an
embarrassment. It is an embarrassment to this Chamber. It is an
embarrassment to our responsibility. I certainly am appealing that it
be remedied. There is time to remedy it. The President hasn't put
forward his nomination yet. It is time to recognize that perhaps those
comments that were put forward in the heat of the moment can be set
aside and we can still do our job.
When people elect a President, they don't say to the President: Do
your job for 3 years, but you get the last year off. When they elect
us, they don't say: Well, do your job for 5 years, but you get the last
year off. They certainly don't say: And by the way, after a couple of
years, you can take a year off from your constitutional
responsibilities. A President is elected for all 4 years. Our
responsibility is to provide advice and consent, and it goes on
continuously.
In the last 200 years, the Senate has carried out its duty to give a
fair and timely hearing and a floor vote to the President's Supreme
Court nominees--whether the President was a Democrat or a Republican,
whether this body was led by a Democratic majority or a Republican
majority. Let's not change that tradition. Let's not fail our
responsibility. In fact, let's honor our constitutional responsibility.
[[Page S1365]]
I will close by calling on my colleagues: Let's work together to
diminish the partisanship and improve the problem-solving. Let's turn
down the rhetoric in terms of our back and forth during this campaign
year and, certainly, turn it down enough that we can fulfill that core
responsibility that provides advice and consent on nominations and
certainly on what is probably the most significant and important
nomination--that of an individual to the Supreme Court of the United
States of America.
To summarize, the Constitution lays out the job before us. The
American citizens expect us to do our jobs. Let's do our job.
Genetically Modified Food
Mr. President, I am going to shift gears here to discuss a bill that
has recently come out of committee and the way that we should consider
responding to it. This conversation is all about defending Americans'
right to know what is in the food they buy and Americans' right to know
what is in the food they feed to their family and they feed to their
children. I will also discuss the legislation I am putting forward to
attempt to be a bridge between some very different visions on that
topic.
Let me start by saying this is all about genetically modified food
and the information provided to citizens on the package about that.
This often turns into a debate: Well, GMO has done some wonderful
things over here. Others say: Well, it has created some problems over
here.
I am going to acknowledge that both of those are true. It has done
some very positive things, and I will mention some in specific. But it
has also created some challenges, some problems, and I will mention
some of those. But after we recognize that that is the case, where do
we come back to? Here is where we come back to: We should enable the
individual in our beautiful Republic to make the decision and not have
Big Government make the decision or suppress information. That is what
happens in the non-``we the people'' world. That is what happens in
dictatorships. That is not what should happen here in the United States
of America, where individuals have the right to know what is in their
food.
Let me go ahead and explain some of the benefits and some of the
challenges. Let's start with the example of golden rice. Golden rice
was developed by the International Rice Research Institute. It provides
greater amounts of vitamin A in the rice to reduce the deficiency that
exists in many diets around this planet for that essential vitamin.
That is a pretty positive development. I don't know at this point of
any side effects or other things that have been brought to light.
Nature is complicated, but for now, let's recognize that providing
vitamin A where it is needed is a pretty positive thing.
Let's take a look at carrots. Carrot cells have been transgenically
modified to produce a chemical that treats Gaucher's disease. Gaucher's
disease is a metabolic disorder where people lack a specific enzyme
which helps rid the body of certain fatty substances. Those fatty
substances then accumulate, causing enlarged livers, spleens, bone
damage, bruising, and anemia. These transgenic carrots are part of the
answer, part of the solution.
Let's turn to sweet potatoes. Researchers are genetically modifying
sweet potatoes to withstand multiple viral infections commonly
encountered in South Africa, making this a much more successful crop
and providing more food to people who need more food. So that is a
positive development.
All of this is not a one-sided scientific picture. There are also
scientifically documented concerns. We can call them scientifically
documented problems that have occurred with transgenic crops.
Let me start by noting that the most common transgenic crops in
America are crops that have been modified to be resistant to
glyphosate. That is an herbicide. After the introduction of these
resistant crops, which means you can put more herbicides or weed
killers--you can put a lot more weed killer onto the acreage--you
basically knock out the weeds much more easily and less expensively
than with other strategies.
What happened? Well, basically, since 1994--early 1990s--several
major crops have become almost 100-percent transgenic-glyphosate
tolerant. The amount of glyphosate put on the crops has grown from 7.4
million pounds in 1994--let's round it off--to 160 million pounds in
2012, and the number keeps climbing. This is a huge amount of
herbicide. Try to picture in your head 160 million pounds of herbicide.
Well, it is so effective in killing everything except the GM corn, GM
soybeans, and GM sugar beets. It is so effective in killing everything
else that very few weeds survive. One of the weeds that doesn't
survive, because most don't, is milkweed. Milkweed happens to be the
food for the monarch butterfly. As we have seen the enormous increase
of glyphosate applied to our fields, we have seen a crashing of the
monarch butterfly ecology. It is not the only thing affecting the
monarch. Several other things are affecting them as well, but it is--in
scientific study after study--a very significant factor.
Let's also take a look at something else; that is, that all of this
glyphosate doesn't stay on the fields. When it rains, it gets washed
into our waterways. Our waterways are full of things that are affected
by our herbicides, and so it has a big impact on the ecology of our
streams and rivers. That is a serious scientifically documented issue
that we are continuing to learn more about as time passes.
Let's turn to another issue. This is a fascinating story. It is about
a pest that bores into the roots of corn. It is called the corn
rootworm. The corn was modified so it would have a pesticide in the
cells and would kill the rootworm when it bored into the corn, but
guess what happened. If you do this on a vast scale, Mother Nature
comes along and has a few genetic mutations here and there and suddenly
that rootworm starts to propagate with others that are now resistant to
this pesticide that has been put into the roots. So now more pesticide
has to be added to the corn, and as a result of that we have an
opposite outcome than what was expected.
The hope was that this would reduce pesticides, but now you have to
put the pesticides back in it, and so now we have the evolution of
superbugs. Here we have the adult beetle, and the rootworm is a
reference to the larvae stage of this beetle. These are the type of
concerns that are raised.
I say all of this just to explain that while there are benefits of
transgenic crops, there are also issues that are raised in the natural
world. So anyone who takes this floor and says that nobody should be
concerned about bioengineered crops is simply refusing to look at the
scientific literature that says, no, there are things we should be
concerned about. That is why it comes back to the right of the
individual to know what is in their food. They want to know if it is a
transgenic crop, and they can look up the details and make their own
decision. Why have Big Government say that we are going to make the
decision for you? Why have Big Government say that we don't trust you
with information and we are not going to allow you to know what is in
your food? No. That should be in some dictatorship, not in the United
States of America.
Well, we have a big battle now because out of committee last week has
come a bill, and this bill is known as the DARK bill. It stands for
Deny Americans the Right to Know because Big Ag says that we don't
believe in this whole ``we the people'' model of a republic. No, we
like to have a government that makes decisions for people and that
denies information to people because we don't trust them, as consumers,
to decide what they want to eat. We don't want them to know what they
are feeding their children and their family. We want to make the
decision for them. Well, 90-plus percent of Americans disagree. They
want the information to make the decision on their own. They can find
out about the benefits over here. They can find out about the concerns
over here. Different foods have different transgenic crops in them.
They should get to make the decision and not have Big Government making
the decision for them.
This bill, the DARK Act, prohibits counties, cities, and States from
any decision to provide information on a package to their citizens
about what is in their food regarding transgenic crops.
I got together with the representatives of the food industry and
advocates for consumer information. I tried
[[Page S1366]]
to find out if there is an overlap so we can craft a bill that will
bring these two communities together, and we made some progress on
that, and so I will share that with everyone.
Basically, a big concern of the food industry--totally legitimate--is
that they don't want 50 different standards in 50 different States or
to have a bunch of counties decide to make up their own rules, which
would result in hundreds or thousands of rules. If you operate a
warehouse, you can't send different cans of soups to grocery stores
across the country. No. So that makes sense. They want a 50-State
solution. Furthermore, they want to have it acknowledged that there is
nothing pejorative about the concept of bioengineering or transgenic.
They want to know that people know this is a situation where there are
some positive benefits, and I have mentioned some of those positive
benefits. They don't want a label on the front of the package because
they think it would be scary to consumers, and they want flexibility as
to exactly what system they use to alert consumers.
The bill I put forward provides all of those goals for a 50-State
solution. There is nothing on the front of the package, nothing
pejorative, and provides flexibility for the food industry. It does not
go to the final step that much of the food industry wants, which is no
unpackaged labeling because then there is no compromise between the two
sides.
The consumer side would like to have something mandatory so it is on
each package of food. They want it clear so a person can pick up the
food or the can or the sack and have it easy to identify on the
package. That is the compromise bill I have put forward. It enables the
food industry to either put an asterisk on an ingredient that is
bioengineered and have it explained below or it enables an industry to
put a symbol in parentheses after the ingredient or it enables an
industry to just put a symbol on the ingredients panel. In Brazil they
use a ``t.'' It is a very simple ``t.'' It is not scary, but for those
who want to know, it is identified.
This approach of simplicity--nothing scary, simple access that is
easy to see--this is the bulk of what both sides want to accomplish so
we can have a 50-State standard.
It has been endorsed by a number of groups. Over the last few days my
bill has been endorsed by Campbell's, Stoneyfield, and Nature's Path.
It has been endorsed by Amy's Kitchen and Ben & Jerry's and Just Label
It.
We can give up the ability of each State to have a separate labeling
system if we do this simple symbol or parentheses or asterisk on the
ingredients panel so a person who cares can look it up.
I think about it this way. My daughter has always wanted to buy
products that don't have highly enriched corn syrup or high fructose
corn syrup. Along the way, she read something and said: I am just not
sure that is something I want to buy. So she picks up a package, turns
it over, and often the ingredients on the package have tiny print, but
she can figure it out. It is the same for this. Enable the consumer who
is willing and wants to make the effort to be able to pick up a can--
again, it doesn't have to be on the front--and find out what is going
on.
This is the world standard. There are 64 other countries, including
28 members of the European Union, Japan, Australia, and Brazil, that
all require some type of indication on the ingredients panel or on the
package. Do you know who else is in that group? China. China is a
dictatorship. China doesn't deny its citizens the right to know. How is
it possible that a bill in this Chamber has been introduced to take
away the right of Americans to know what is in their food? Even China
doesn't do that, and we must not do it either.
I appreciate the folks who have already signed up to sponsor this
bill. Senator Leahy, Senator Tester, Senator Feinstein, Senator
Sanders, Senator Murphy, Senator Gillibrand, and Senator Blumenthal,
thank you. Thank you for standing up for your citizens' right to know.
Thank you for standing up for a fair compromise that solves the big
problem the food industry is facing with the potential of 50 different
States having 50 different standards. Thank you for finding the area of
compromise that works on both sides of this equation.
I appreciate the endorsements. I appreciate the sponsors, but what I
really appreciate is that we have freedom of speech in our country to
be able to carry on this conversation, but how is it consistent to have
freedom of speech and then say that we want to ban information from our
consumers? How is that consistent? This is like the mob that says that
we don't want our citizens to read certain books so we are going to
burn them, we are going to ban them--and that is what this DARK Act
does. It has been introduced and went through the Agriculture
Committee. It bans the ability of States to provide information to
their consumers. That is just wrong. Even China doesn't go there, and
we should not go there either.
I thank the Presiding Officer.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon we had a very
strong vote here in the U.S. Senate to move forward on the legislation
we are currently considering. It is called the Comprehensive Addiction
and Recovery Act. It is legislation that is intended to make the
Federal Government a better partner with State and local governments,
with our nonprofits who are in the trenches around the country, and
with all of our States dealing with this now-epidemic level of heroin
addiction, prescription drug addiction, and overdoses.
Today, as we are here in the Senate, on average, we will lose over
100 people a day in the United States of America to deaths from
overdoses. Frankly, that is just part of the problem, as horrible as
that is. So many people are being saved by this miracle drug called
naloxone or Narcan. Also, others who may not be overdosing are not
working. Their families are broken apart. They are committing crimes to
support their addiction. So many Americans are not achieving their God-
given purpose because of this addiction issue that is gripping our
country. Our legislation is meant to address it in a very direct way.
The debate on the floor that we had over the past week has been very
interesting to me. It is the first time in decades that this Congress
has taken up this issue in this manner. We have had a very open debate
on addiction policy. What does it mean? I think what you heard Members
say on both sides of the aisle is that we have learned a lot about
addiction over the years and that addiction now is viewed by most as a
disease, an illness. Like other illnesses, it needs treatment.
I think that is a very important change in terms of how we address
this issue, and the policy before us today on this floor that I hope we
will vote on in the next 12 hours or so represents a change in thinking
about this, that indeed we want to do everything we can to prevent the
addiction in the first place, to keep people out of the funnel of
addiction, to have better efforts in education and prevention, and that
is in this legislation. But also, once we have people who are addicted,
we need to get them into treatment. And for people who are arrested for
possession, who are users of drugs, it is better to get them into
treatment and recovery than just getting them into jail or prison
because we have found that hasn't worked. So the criminal justice
system has a role to play here--legalization is not a good idea--but
that ought to be, in part, diverting people into treatment that works
better for them to be able to get at this problem. Otherwise, folks
will continue to see these incredibly high levels of use, addiction,
and all the negative consequences that stem from that.
I thank my coauthor of this legislation, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse.
He and I have worked together over the past few years on this
legislation, bringing in experts from all over the country and getting
expertise from our home States. In Ohio, we had a number of roundtable
discussions that added a lot of important input to be able to come up
with legislation that actually
[[Page S1367]]
works, that is actually going to direct funding to evidence-based
programs and prevention and treatment and recovery that work.
We talked a lot to our law enforcement community. That is one reason
the Fraternal Order of Police supports our legislation. So does the
Sheriffs' Association, so do the prosecutors, and so do the attorneys
general, because we have actually worked with them to say: How can you
be more effective in dealing with this very real problem you have in
your community? And if you talk to law enforcement, you talk to
firefighters, you talk to emergency medical folks, they will tell you
this issue is at the top of their list. They are frustrated by it. They
are looking for a solution, and this legislation helps to come up with
the solution.
I also thank Senator Ayotte, Senator Klobuchar, and 42 bipartisan
cosponsors for their support of this legislation. It is comprehensive,
it is evidence-based, and it is going to make a difference.
Not only has it had a lot of support here in the Senate--and I hope
we will see that again in the final vote--but it also has support in
the House of Representatives. There was a companion bill at one time
that was identical to our legislation, also called CARA, the
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Ours has changed a little bit
through the process, but it is very similar to the House companion
bill. There are over 80 cosponsors to that legislation. It is a
bipartisan bill on the House side as well.
So this is one of those issues where if we pass it here in the
Senate, we have a very good chance of passing it in the House and
getting it to the President for his signature so it can begin to make a
difference in our communities.
The reason we are here today talking about this is, again, because so
many people are suffering. There are 23 million Americans, it is said--
23 million Americans--who are in recovery from addiction. Think about
that. We are doing this for them, to ensure that they can have
successful recoveries, to help them to ensure that they can keep their
lives together and not fall back into this struggle of addiction.
With 23 million people recovering, think of the millions who are
still struggling. Together, those who are recovering and those who are
addicted have begun to stand up and let their voices be heard. That is
one of the differences I have seen in this debate, is that the stigma
that has been associated with addiction has begun to be removed.
There was a rally here on the Capital Mall several months ago. It was
called the Unite to Face Addiction rally. There were people there from
all over the country. Thousands of people came to Washington, DC--
thousands. And the message from them was, one, pass CARA, this
legislation--and I appreciate their help. We wouldn't be here today on
the floor talking about this issue if they hadn't engaged with their
elected representatives in the House and the Senate and our leadership
to help us get this moving. Second, there message was, look, addiction
is a disease and it has to be treated like other illnesses, and we have
to have legislation that helps break the stigma associated with drug
addiction so that we can address it and we can begin to get people out
of the grip of addiction and get our communities and families out of
the grip of addiction. This is a cause, and it is one that requires law
enforcement and the criminal justice system, but it also requires love
and faith and communities coming together. It is one that we can only
carry out together--all of us, not as Republicans or Democrats or
Independents but as Americans, as fathers and mothers, family members
and friends and coworkers who care about those who are facing this
great challenge of addiction.
CARA now has the support of over 130 groups around the country. These
are criminal justice groups. These are people who are in the trenches
every day dealing with treatment and prevention. These are folks who
are in public health. These are people who are in law enforcement and
understand the importance of this. They have all come together to say:
Let's pass this legislation so we can begin to implement this evidence-
based program to respond to this epidemic.
It does add prevention and education efforts. It does do a lot to get
prescription drugs off the shelves and get the medication out of the
hands of our youth. It does allow us to monitor drugs. It authorizes
law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and methamphetamine in
areas that are particularly hard hit. It expands the availability of
the miracle drug we talked about earlier--it doesn't always work, but
it has saved a lot of lives--called naloxone or Narcan.
In the criminal justice system, it does identify and treat
individuals suffering from substance abuse disorders and expands
diversion and education efforts to give those individuals that second
chance.
We give special help in this legislation to our veterans. We
establish more funds for these veterans treatment courts. I have been
to them in Ohio. They are incredible. Yesterday, I talked about the
story of one of the veterans who had been in and out of the prison
system. Now he not only has his life back together, he has his family
back together. He is back in school getting a degree. He is one example
of many who got off track because of PTSD, because of an addiction,
used self-medication to deal with his PTSD, was in the prison system
and is now back out. We are supporting that effort.
We do help women who are postpartum and suffer from addiction. We do
help babies who are born addicted. We have this incredible situation
where in Ohio we now have a 750-percent increase in the number of
babies who are born with this syndrome--with addiction. They have to be
taken through withdrawal. I have gone to these neonatal units with my
wife, and we have seen these incredibly compassionate doctors and
nurses. What I hear from them is, you have to do something. This
legislation takes that important step to the Federal level.
CARA supports recovery programs focused on youth and building
communities of recovery. It creates a national task force on recovery
to get the experts really engaged to help us to improve ways to address
some of the collateral consequences caused by addiction.
Economists will tell us that addiction now costs this country about
$700 billion every year. Think about that. That is lost productivity.
That is more expensive health care. If you go to the emergency room in
your community to find out what is going on, you will see a lot of
people coming in because of addiction. There is the cost of policing
and incarceration. Law enforcement tells me that most of the crime
being committed in our communities is now being committed because of
this issue.
So $700 billion every single year is a lot of money, no doubt, but
addiction costs us something else too: It costs us in dreams that are
never fulfilled, in families who are torn apart, in lives that are
lost. We don't just measure our success in dollars and cents. We
measure it in safer neighborhoods, less crime, in empty jail cells, and
by the number of people who never have to struggle with drug abuse in
the first place because of more effective prevention and education. We
measure it in the moms and dads who beat addictions so they can come
back to be with their kids and bring their families back together. We
measure it in the families who are not torn apart but instead are
healed.
As we move forward to pass this legislation--the Comprehensive
Addiction and Recovery Act--our message is a really simple one. To
those who struggle with addiction, to those who think they cannot
overcome, to those who believe there is no one out there who cares
about them or can help them: You are not alone. We are with you. There
is hope. I have seen people beat this. I have known people who have
beat this. You can beat this.
And we can be a better partner here at the Federal Government to be
able to help people overcome this struggle. We need to pass this bill
and get it signed into law to begin to make a real difference for the
families we represent.
The House has companion legislation also called CARA. They have a big
bipartisan group supporting it. After we pass this legislation here--
because I am confident we will based on the vote this afternoon--I hope
the House will take it up, take up CARA, and get it passed. Let's get
it to the President for his signature, and let's truly begin to
[[Page S1368]]
deal with this epidemic--it is at crisis levels, it is urgent, and it
can't wait--so that we, all of us, can begin to make a real difference
for those we represent.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Maryland.
Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar
Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, Senator Cardin of Maryland, my
colleague, and I are here on the floor today to ask that two
nominations for the Federal bench, the district court, be confirmed.
They are the next two judges in line on the Executive Calendar for the
Federal district courts.
One is Mr. Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., a highly qualified nominee from
the State of Tennessee. The other is Ms. Paula Xinis from our own State
of Maryland, a brilliant, talented lawyer who also is ready to be
confirmed. Both have been approved by the Judiciary Committee. Mr.
Crenshaw was approved in July and has been waiting for a vote. Ms.
Xinis was approved by the Judiciary Committee in September. So it has
been more than 6 months to allow Senators to be able to evaluate the
excellent work done by the Judiciary Committee on whether these
nominees should be confirmed.
We think it is time that the full Senate did its job and gave these
two outstanding candidates for the bench a vote. Therefore, I come to
the Senate floor with Senator Cardin and I ask unanimous consent that
the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following
nominations: Calendar No. 215 and Calendar No. 307; that the Senate
proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on these
nominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be
considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or
debate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that
any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be
immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume
legislative session.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
The Senator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would
just point out to my friends from Maryland, and the senior Senator who
has made this consent request asking that we move off of the current
legislation--the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--off of that
important legislation into executive session to consider these
nominations, that it is the prerogative of the majority leader to set
the agenda. If every Senator could come to the floor and cherry-pick
different nominations from the calendar and ask consent that we move to
executive session and then consider those, it would result in some
chaos. For those reasons, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
The Senator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am certainly disappointed by the Senator
from Texas objecting to the request of the senior Senator from
Maryland, Ms. Mikulski.
The request of Senator Mikulski is for us to consider two article III
judges who are next in line for consideration before the U.S. Senate.
They have cleared the committee. They have both been approved by the
committee by voice vote, a unanimous vote within the Judiciary
Committee.
I know Paula Xinis--the vacancy to be filled in Maryland at
University Park. She joined the law firm of Murphy, Falcon & Murphy in
Baltimore. She is a senior trial attorney, well qualified to take the
seat of the former chief justice, Deborah Chasanow. She was appointed
by President Obama in March of 2015. We are now approaching the 1-year
anniversary of her appointment--1 year anniversary for a
noncontroversial, well-qualified appointment to the district court.
Let me just talk a little bit about fairness. I heard what the
Senator from Texas said about the majority leader scheduling the votes
on the floor of the Senate, but I think my colleagues should be aware
of the facts in regard to filling judicial vacancies.
We have completed the confirmation process on 16 article III judges
since the beginning of this term of Congress. The comparable number in
the last 2 years of a Presidential term where the President was of the
Republican Party and the Senate was controlled by the Democrats--just
the opposite of what we have today--was the year 2007 and 2008 under
President George W. Bush. The Judiciary Committee was chaired by
Chairman Leahy. That year, by March 9, we had cleared and confirmed 40
judicial appointments--40 compared to 16 in this Congress. By the end
of the year, we had approved 68 of President Bush's nominees.
Going back to the other time with a Republican President and with a
Democratically controlled Senate--President Reagan--in 1987 and 1988,
under Chairman Biden, by March 9 of the last year, the Senate had
confirmed 47 of his nominations, compared to 16 this year, and by the
end of the year, we had confirmed 85 nominees, including a Supreme
Court Justice, Justice Kennedy.
We have pending right now on the floor of the Senate that have
cleared committees--every single one by voice vote unanimously--we have
12 article III judges who are ready for action and 5 other judicial
appointments, for a total of 17. But that is not the whole story. We
have 25 nominees who are still pending before the Judiciary Committee,
including Stephanie Gallagher of Maryland, to fill a vacancy. This is
not the only vacancy we have in Maryland. We now have two in Maryland
waiting for action by the U.S. Senate.
So there is a matter of fairness here. There is also a matter of
respect for the judicial branch of government in allowing the courts to
be able to function.
The district court is where most individuals get their justice. That
is the trial court. That is the court where most of our citizens will
go for their judicial relief. We have vacancies where appointments have
been made that are noncontroversial, well-qualified people, and we
can't get a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate? My friend from Texas
tells me this is the prerogative of the majority leader. It is our
responsibility to act on these nominations.
Senator Mikulski has set up a process in Maryland where we take an
interview process to get the very best talent to serve on our courts. I
am honored to work with her as we go through the process of finding the
very best to serve on the courts. How do you expect to allow their name
to come forward when it takes a year to consider a nomination? If you
want to get the very best on the courts, we have to act, and we have to
be responsible.
Let me just say something. We have to take up these nominations. I
appreciate that we always have a lot of work that we have to do. We
have time today to get these nominations done. I call on the majority
leader and I call on my friends to say: Look, let's get our court
vacancies filled. Let's carry out our responsibility and vote on these
nominations.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.
Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, why am I here today on the floor asking
for these two nominations to be confirmed? They are the next two judges
in line on the Executive Calendar for our Federal district courts:
Waverly Crenshaw, Jr., a highly qualified and talented nominee from the
great State of Tennessee; and Paula Xinis, nominated from my State of
Maryland. Both Mr. Crenshaw and Ms. Xinis have been waiting for months
to have their day and get their vote. Mr. Crenshaw has been waiting
since July, Ms. Xinis since September. I think 6 months is enough time
to provide our advice and evaluate these nominees. It is time to do our
jobs and give these candidates a vote. I urge the Republicans to allow
these nominations to move forward.
We are easily on pace to be the least productive Senate in recent
history. Last year Republicans confirmed the fewest judges in almost 50
years: a total of 11 in 2015. Since Republicans took over the Senate
the number of judicial emergencies has nearly tripled, which leaves
courts overworked and understaffed.
Now some Republicans say there is precedent for their obstructionism.
Some Republican Senators have tried to fudge their numbers, saying the
judges confirmed during our lameduck session at the end of 2014 should
count toward their abysmal numbers for 2015. Well, what about those
numbers? I didn't realize that's how the Senate
[[Page S1369]]
worked: that we take credit for work that others did. Some Republican
Senators specifically asked for lameduck passage of their nominees.
They didn't want to wait for the next Congress--but they're stalling
now, before we are even in lameduck. They are already talking about
stopping nominations with 9 months left to do work.
A lack of judges has real consequences for the American people. Due
to our constitutional protections, criminal trials must happen with a
``speedy and public trial.'' What does this mean in our courts?
Criminal trials end up prioritized, protecting those charged with
crimes, but civil trials are put on hold--sometimes for years--while we
wait for judges to have time for them. What does this mean for the
American people? Judges spend less time on cases, judges have to
encourage cases to settle instead of getting their day in court, judges
have to encourage defendants to consider plea deals rather than wait
out a lengthy trial process. Justice delayed is justice denied, which
is what is happening around our country right now.
For Marylanders to receive their day in court, we need Judge Paula
Xinis to be on the bench. I was extremely proud to nominate Paula Xinis
to President Obama with Senator Cardin. She is a brilliant litigator
and public servant. When I consider nominees for the Federal bench, I
have four criteria: absolute integrity, judicial competence and
temperament, a commitment to core constitutional principles, and a
history of civic engagement in Maryland. Ms. Xinis exceeds these
criteria. She has dedicated her career to the rule of law. The
persistence and character she has shown in advocating for her clients
and in her activities in the community make her truly an outstanding
nominee. She has a deep respect for the law and what it means to every
American. She will ensure that everyone who comes before her truly
feels that they have been heard and have received equal justice under
the law.
It is absolutely critical that we have judges in our courts to make
sure that the judiciary is strong, independent, and that all Americans
get their days in court. The President has made dozens upon dozens of
judicial nominations. Now the Senate must do its job. Enough time has
passed on these two nominees. It is time to have our say. I do not take
this duty lightly, but I will do my job. I carefully evaluate nominees
and render an independent judgement based on my commitment to core
constitutional principles. These candidates deserve timely hearings and
timely votes. We have had the hearings. We have had plenty of time to
evaluate their merits. Now is the time to vote.
Mr. President, I would like to compliment once again my very able
colleague from Maryland for his statement, in which he laid out facts
and he laid out the historic precedent, and I want to associate myself
with those remarks.
I also want to add that I am really frustrated. I am so frustrated
that, No. 1, President Obama doesn't get to be President Obama. His job
as President is to nominate competent people for an independent branch
of government, the Federal judiciary. He did his job. Then it came to
the Senate. Really, we thank the Judiciary Committee because they did
hold a hearing and did their due diligence to examine the worthiness of
whether these nominees should be brought to the Senate. Do they have
the judicial temperament? Do they have the judicial experience? Are
they of sound character to truly be independent and render impartial
justice, which our Constitution mandates? The Judiciary Committee said
yes.
It comes to the Senate on something called the Executive Calendar.
That is Senate-speak for the nominating calendar. It means they are on
the calendar, waiting their turn to have a vote, but this is just a
slowdown.
We don't want to be in a showdown here. I didn't bring this up with
Senator Cardin to disrupt consideration of the opioid bill. We have a
terrible problem in Maryland with opioids and heroin. We are for this
bill. We are for bipartisan action, but we are driven to taking action,
asking for unanimous consent because we are not getting action.
I would have yielded to a compromise if the gentleman from Texas,
himself a member at one time of the Texas Supreme Court, had said: How
about Mr. Crenshaw first and Ms. Xinis after the break that will be
coming up? You know, we are like college kids; we get spring break.
Well, we would agree to that. All we are looking for is for Mr.
Crenshaw, who was on the calendar before Ms. Xinis, to go first.
We are not pushing, but we are persistent. All we want is a time
certain when we could get a vote on Ms. Xinis. We are now in the
business of discouraging people from coming into public service. They
are willing to put their career on hold and their life on examination
to be able to serve on the Federal bench or other nominations. She did
it. Our nominee did it. She is in a law firm. Her career is on hold.
We also have Ms. Stephanie Gallagher, who is a Federal magistrate
judge, waiting for a hearing. What are we doing here? People are
finally going to say: I don't want the hassle. I don't want the
harassment. I don't want to go through all this just to wait, wait,
wait, wait.
The Senate needs to move in an orderly way. When a nominee has been
moved through the process, nominated by the President, gone through the
due diligence of the Judiciary Committee, and is waiting, I think we
ought to do it. I think we ought to take a couple of days and just vote
on these nominations.
I believe our courts are overwhelmed. There are backlogs in the
courts. There are people waiting for their ability to have a trial. We
need good judges. We need to be able to make sure that the people are
willing to serve and they have the credentials, the judicial
temperament, and the character to serve. We need to be able to at least
give them a vote. Now, if you don't like the Obama nominees, vote them
down. Vote them down, but don't slow down the process.
We have a constitutionally mandated process. Let's follow it. Let's
do our job. We have Mr. Crenshaw and Ms. Xinis. We are happy to have
Mr. Crenshaw go first, but we sure would like a date for Ms. Xinis.
We call out to our colleagues to give us a date, give us a vote. Give
it to us now.
Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the
Senate as in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
The Senator from Arizona.
Omnibus and Defense Authorization Bill
Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last night we saw another unusual election
result. We see a ``businessman'' now in a very significant lead for the
nomination of the Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln and
Ronald Reagan.
As I watched the postmortems last night and this morning, we see
again that many of those who voted cite as one of their primary--if not
the primary--reasons distaste, anger, and frustration about Washington,
DC, specifically the Congress of the United States, as well as the
President. They believe they need somebody who is an outsider, someone
who is not ``of the establishment.'' I guess that applies to anyone who
is in elected office.
Some of us have been surprised. Certainly no one predicted these
outcomes, not only on the Republican side but on the Democratic side.
We saw our colleague from Vermont engineer quite a stunning upset in
the State of Michigan last night. But he also--even though a Member of
the Senate, Senator Sanders clearly is speaking in opposition to the
machine, the business as usual in Washington.
Sometimes we ask ourselves why the American people give us such a low
approval rating. I see polls show that the approval rating of Congress
is 12 percent, 13 percent, 14 percent, sometimes as high as 15 percent.
I would inform and remind my colleagues that it wasn't always like
that. We didn't always have such a low approval rating in the Congress
by the American people.
[[Page S1370]]
I think it is worthy of note that in the last year since regaining
the majority, we have enacted some legislation that I think we could be
proud to go back and talk to our constituents about, whether it be
education reform, where we did away with common core, or whether it be
a highway bill that was much needed to provide infrastructure for our
States, counties, and towns. We passed a budget. We passed a defense
authorization bill that has some of the most significant reforms in
history. But the fact is, those numbers haven't changed, and they
haven't changed sometimes for good reason.
That is why I come to the floor today, because I am ashamed and
embarrassed, as a representative of the people of my State, to talk
about billions of dollars of unnecessary wasteful spending of their
taxpayer dollars, and it happened on the Omnibus appropriations bill--
omnibus. A lot of my constituents don't know what ``omnibus'' means.
What it means is, we are required to take up 13 appropriations bills.
We don't do it--and I would put the responsibility for that on the
other side of the aisle, but it doesn't matter, really, because we end
up, at the end of the year, with a massive, hundreds of billions of
dollars bill that is about this high, that none of us have seen or read
and there is no amendment to it, and we have approximately 48 to 72
hours in which to vote yes or no, with the option being the government
not continuing to function. That is not the way to do business. That
doesn't inspire any confidence in us on the part of the American
people, and it is disgraceful.
So the omnibus, again, was passed with votes from both sides,
actually, but the fact is that our responsibility was to take up these
bills one by one, to examine them, to have amendments, and to have the
Congress--in this case, the Senate--work its will. We didn't do that.
Here it was. We walked in, and here was this bill--not that size but
this size--that no one had read, no one had a chance to peruse, and
even if we had, we couldn't do anything about it because the bill was
not amendable because if we amend it, then it bounces back to the other
side of the Capitol, and we run out of time, and the government shuts
down. That is the wrong way to do business.
One of the major reasons for what happened is it is open to
incredible abuse. I came to the floor today to talk about the abuse of
the most sacred responsibility we have, which is the defense of this
Nation.
I am proud to be chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, a
post I aspired to for many years. We work hard on the Defense
authorization bill. We work hard in the Senate Armed Services
Committee. We work on a bipartisan basis. We have hearings, we examine
the issues, and we examine the programs. We are talking about, again,
hundreds of billions of dollars, of taxpayers' dollars, whether it be
pay and benefits for the men and women who are serving or whether it be
the equipment they need or many of the policies that govern the defense
of this Nation. And I am proud of the work we do.
So after producing a bill with an overwhelming majority vote--90-some
votes--with the authorization for all of this to do with our Nation's
defense, the Appropriations Committee decides to overrule what we have
authorized, in violation not only of the way the Senate is supposed to
function but in violation of a resolution adopted by the Republican
conference, which I will read:
Earmark Moratorium
Resolved, that it is the policy of the Republican
Conference that no Member shall request a congressionally
directed spending item, limited tax benefit, or limited
tariff benefit, as such items are used. . . .
Et cetera.
So what was in this omnibus bill? Let me give you the best example:
$225 million for a ship called a joint high-speed vessel, for a ship
the Navy did not want. No one asked for this.
We had hearings in the Armed Services Committee on shipbuilding. We
examined all of the proposals. Some of them we didn't accept. Others we
did. Others, through votes in the committee, debate, and discussion,
came up with our shipbuilding authorization.
So what was done in this Omnibus appropriations bill by the
Appropriations Committee? For the second year in a row, $225 million
the Navy did not request and did not need.
By the way, my friends, I would not take too much time in the Senate,
but building a ship is just the beginning of the expense. You have to
man it, you have to put the ammunition on it, you have to put the
equipment on it, and you have to operate it for as long as 30 years,
and the Navy did not want it. The Navy has lots of unmet military
requirements. So what was put in there and why? Because, frankly--and I
use these words without reservation--it is made in Mobile, AL. It is
made in Mobile, AL. It is blatant. It is blatant. And then, of course,
there were so many other items in it.
It is like any other evil. First you condemn things. Then you condone
them. Then you embrace them. There is no better example of that than
the so-called money for ``medical research.'' In fact, years ago
somebody decided: Hey, we will spend some money for medical research on
some of the illnesses that affect the men and women in the military. I
don't take exception to that. But it grew and grew and grew and grew
and grew.
Now, in this bill, $1.2 billion extra--not million but billion
dollars--is asked for. Let me give examples: $120 million for breast
cancer, $12 million for lung cancer, $6 million for multiple sclerosis,
$20 million for ovarian cancer, $7.5 million for epilepsy, $12.9
million for HIV/AIDS. My friends, all of those are worthy causes. All
of those should probably be funded.
We should do all those things, but not on the Defense bill. It was
not authorized and was jammed in for the Willy Sutton syndrome. The
Willy Sutton syndrome is about the famous bank robber who, when asked
why he robbed banks, said: That is where the money is. Well, the
defense appropriations is where the money is.
So here we have, over the last 23 years, as it has grown and grown
and grown, just $2.4 billion of the $10 billion spent on these
congressionally directed medical research programs being relevant to
the military. In other words, $7 billion went to research things such
as osteoporosis and mad cow disease instead of training, equipment, and
care for our troops and their families.
We do not have enough money to care for the men and women in the
military and take care of their families and take care of their medical
needs. We don't have enough money for that as a result of
sequestration. So what did they do? They put in $1.2 billion more in
medical research.
There are a few other examples. There is an additional $7 million in
funding for a machine gun. These guns are made with a 500-percent
increase. There is $750 million for a National Guard and Reserve
equipment fund and $600 million in additional funding for DOD's science
and technology budget.
This is very interesting, my friends, this science and technology
budget. Here is what happens. They put out $600 million, and it is
supposed to be for ``scientific and technology research.'' But it
doesn't say for what specific item. So what happens is the members of
the Appropriations Committee then write to the Department of Defense
and tell them to spend certain money on certain projects. That is the
way of getting around the letter of the earmark ban if not the spirit
of it.
Then, of course, there is the Russian rocket. Today we are having to
use for space launches Russian rocket engines. The company that makes
these Russian rocket engines happens to be run by cronies of Vladimir
Putin. In fact, two of the cronies of Vladimir Putin are such thugs and
gangsters that they have been on our sanctions list. We have sanctioned
them. Yet our friends on the Appropriations Committee, again, with
ULA--the people who are buying these rocket engines--are based in
Alabama and, of course, headquartered in Chicago, IL. The engines, as I
mentioned, are manufactured by this Russian company that is controlled
by a guy name Chemezov and a guy named Rogozin, who have been
sanctioned. Yet we are sending tens of millions of dollars to them.
What we did was we restricted the cost and encouraged the
competition, and we had hearings on it. It was a big issue. We had
votes in the committee on it, we discussed it and we debated it. And so
what did the appropriators do? They put a provision into this bill
reversing what we authorizers did. That
[[Page S1371]]
is in complete violation of the rules of the Republican conference.
So I have talked very often with our twelve freshmen. I can't be more
proud of what these freshmen Senators have brought to this conference.
They have brought enthusiasm, they have brought knowledge, they have
brought youth, they have brought military experience--people like
Senator Ernst and Senator Cotton and others who bring their military
experience. I am so proud to have many of them serving on the Armed
Services Committee. I have asked them to get together and condemn this.
I campaigned for almost all of them. They promised the people of their
States, as I promised the people of my State, that I wouldn't allow
this waste of billions of their tax dollars, that I would fight against
it. So I am asking our freshmen Senators to join together--and I hope
they will because I have had conversations with them--to reject this,
and, if we go into another appropriations omnibus, that they will not
allow this to happen.
Why did I focus my comments on defense? It is for two reasons. No. 1
is obvious. I am chairman of the Committee on Armed Services. So I take
strong exception when the men and women who are serving in the military
are having to leave the military involuntarily because we don't have
enough money, yet they are wasting billions--billions--of taxpayer
dollars. Second of all, it is not right. It is not right. And thirdly,
we authorize--we authorize--and our bill is passed by the Senate and
the House, for 53 straight years, and signed by the President of the
United States.
This bill is important to defend the Nation. When our careful
deliberations, our votes, our hearings, our debates day after day on
the floor of the Senate as we consider the authorization bill is then
overturned--overturned--and pork barrel projects such as a $225 million
extra vessel the Navy neither needs nor wants are added to it, then, my
friends, do not be surprised when we have an approval rating of 12 or
13 or 14 percent.
The American people are smart. Our constituents are smart. When they
see billions of dollars wasted in this fashion, it is no wonder we
receive their condemnation and their sarcasm and their disapproval.
So I am asking my freshmen colleagues to take the lead--to take the
lead because they are the ones who are closest to the people--and to
help me reject this corrupt process. And it is corrupt.
I want to also assure all of my colleagues that if they try this
again--if they try this again--I will do everything in my power--
everything in my power--to make sure it is reversed or that it never
happens to start with. We owe the American people much better than the
process I just described.
Mr. President, I note the presence of the senior Senator from Texas,
and I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the senior Senator from
Arizona, for his great work over the years, and particularly now in the
Committee on Armed Services, which he chairs. He has been tenacious in
his attempt to make sure that no dollars are inadvertently or
unknowingly wasted, especially when it comes to the Pentagon.
I, for one, believe this is the No. 1 priority of our country. I know
he shares that view. But it is pretty hard to make the argument that we
ought to continue to give more money to the Pentagon if the money is
not being used efficiently, either because of their internal
administrative problems or for some other reason.
I know, because I happened to be at the Pentagon this morning, that
many of our military chiefs are concerned that the things that are
being put in appropriations bills are not things they actually want or
need and that there are other priorities. The best way to get those
vetted is through the Senate Committee on Armed Services and working
with the Appropriations Committee to make sure the money is being used
as efficiently as possible and not wasted--certainly not on things the
military doesn't want or doesn't need.
So I thank my colleague for his continued leadership.
Mr. President, I wanted to talk about a few topics here. No. 1 is the
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the legislation we have been
working on now for 2 weeks. Anybody who has been listening understands
the importance of this legislation, which will help stem the tide of
the massive epidemic of opioid prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse
that continues to claim lives across our country.
This bill is actually a good example of how the Senate can work in a
bipartisan fashion to advance good policies that positively impact the
lives of ordinary American citizens. I know most people in this
polarized environment are not aware of this bipartisan work we have
been able to do over this year and last year, but we have actually done
a number of good things. Some, if you told them, they might not even
believe it, but to the people who are open to the facts, I think this
is another good example. Of course, in this instance, it has been the
result of the strong leadership of the junior Senator from New
Hampshire, Ms. Ayotte; Senator Portman of Ohio; the chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Chuck Grassley;
along with our Democratic counterparts, people like Senator Whitehouse.
I am hopeful this legislation will contain an amendment I offered
last week to help those who struggle with both substance abuse and
mental illness. It is estimated that more than 10 million Americans
suffer from both addiction and mental health disorders. These are
called co-occurring disorders. It is a fact that many people who don't
otherwise get treatment for their mental health problems try to self-
medicate, making their lives even more complicated and worse, and that
is what this amendment is designed to address.
Many mental health and substance abuse services, like specialty
courts, have operated on separate tracks, and they only treat one part
of the problem. This amendment really isn't all that earth-shaking. All
it would do is make the commonsense link between mental health and
substance abuse, something that we direct our existing criminal justice
programs to apply to these coexisting disorders as well. That way
people who struggle with both addiction and mental health problems can
have both of those problems addressed using the money we are already
appropriating and already spending in grants to local law enforcement
and medical providers.
It would also expand substance abuse and transitional services to
help those suffering from co-occurring disorders to receive the
treatment they need to recover. So I look forward to voting on this
legislation and getting it passed soon.
I would note that we are having a few bumps along the way, in terms
of our Democratic friends allowing votes on amendments. There are
apparently about 25 different amendments that have been negotiated
between the Republicans and Democrats, but I am told our Democratic
friends are objecting to any amendments by Senators who happen to be
running for election in 2016.
Now, the Democratic leader, in a fit of candor the other day, said
they were going to object to an amendment authored by the Senator from
Wisconsin, Mr. Johnson, because he is running for election. Well, I
would ask them to back off of that sort of political hardball and to
let us get our work done.
It doesn't help when they object to noncontroversial amendments or
they take certain amendments hostage because they do not want somebody
to score points by getting something done. I mean that is why we are
sent here; it is to get things done for our constituents.
Regarding the amendment I mentioned just a moment ago, that
apparently is one of those being held hostage. I would like to share a
letter from the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the American
Correctional Association, and the National Association of Police
Organizations that supports the amendment I just talked about. If the
Democratic leadership will not listen to me, maybe they will listen to
them. I hope they will listen to the voices of the families who suffer
from mental illness and to law enforcement officials.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in
the Record.
[[Page S1372]]
There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in
the Record, as follows:
March 2, 2016.
Hon. John Cornyn,
Hart Senate Office Building,
Washington, DC.
Dear Senator Cornyn, On behalf of the undersigned mental
health, substance abuse and criminal justice organizations,
we are writing to express our support of the Mental Health
and Substance Abuse Act amendments to S. 524, the
Comprehensive Addictions and Recovery Act (CARA).
Approximately 65% of persons incarcerated in jails and
prisons across the United States have substance use
disorders. Many of these individuals have co-occurring mental
illnesses such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder,
or schizophrenia.
It is further estimated that 2 million people with serious
mental illness are admitted to jails across the U.S. each
year. Twenty percent of all inmates in state and federal
prisons, approximately 314,000 individuals, have serious
mental illness. Many of these individuals also have drug or
alcohol use problems.
Historically, mental health and substance abuse services
have been operated separately, and coordination in addressing
the needs of people with co-occurring mental illness and
substance use disorders has proven challenging. This has been
true as well with specialty courts established to address the
unique needs of non-violent offenders with substance use
disorders (drug courts) or mental illness (mental health
courts). Drug courts have frequently not been equipped to
address the needs of people with mental illness and mental
health courts have frequently not been equipped to address
the needs of people with substance use disorders.
The provisions included in the Mental Health and Substance
Abuse Amendments would be helpful in addressing these
problems.
Section 802 would add ``mental health treatment and
transitional services for those with mental illnesses or with
co-occurring disorders'' among those prioritized for
assistance when transitioning out of criminal justice
systems.
Section 803 would include ``training for drug court
personnel . . . on identifying and addressing co-occurring
substance abuse and mental health problems'' to federal
criminal justice training priorities.
Section 804 would add grants for developing and
implementing specialized residential substance abuse
treatment programs that ``provide appropriate treatment to
inmates with co-occurring mental health and substance abuse
disorders or challenges.''
Inclusion of these provisions in CARA would be very helpful
in fostering positive treatment outcomes and in reducing
recidivism among offenders with mental illness and substance
use disorders.
Senator Cornyn, we greatly appreciate your strong
leadership on these issues and stand ready to help in any way
we can to move them forward.
Please contact Ron Honberg with NAMI with any questions or
if we can provide further support.
Sincerely,
National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), American
Correctional Association, National Association of Police
Organizations, TASC, Inc. (Treatment Alternatives for Safe
Communities--Illinois), The National Alliance to Advance
Adolescent Health, American Orthopsychiatric Association.
Calling For Appointment of a Special Counsel
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, separately, earlier this morning I joined
my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee to hear testimony from
the Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch.
As a former attorney general of my State, I have always taken a great
interest in our system of justice at the State level and now certainly
at the national level, and I have tried to do everything I can to help
strengthen the rule of law and help keep the American people safe, and
that includes transparent and fair investigations.
I spent a little bit of time asking the Attorney General this morning
about her Department's investigation into the former Secretary of
State, Hillary Clinton, and her use of a private email server during
her tenure. I have talked many times on the floor about my concerns
surrounding her use of an unsecured email server. The former Secretary
did refuse to use the government server and decided to basically play
by her own rules, setting up a server at her home in New York. But the
fact is, this sort of reckless conduct put our country at great risk.
Several experts from the intelligence community have outlined how her
unsecured server left her emails--some highly classified--vulnerable to
hacking in cyber attacks. So this is a very serious matter.
Last fall, about 6 months ago, I asked the Attorney General to
appoint a special counsel to fairly and fully conduct an investigation.
That is because Secretary Clinton is not just a random citizen or
former government employee; her case is awfully high-profile. As a
result, I think there are many questioning whether she is being treated
in exactly the same way as any other citizen would be treated under
similar circumstances or whether she is getting some sort of
preferential treatment. Because the Attorney General is a political
appointee of the President of the United States and given Ms. Clinton's
high profile, there are real conflicts of interest and real concerns
about politics ahead of justice. Those could be addressed and mitigated
by providing a special counsel, as the law provides, to provide some
measure of independence from the Attorney General so the public can
have confidence that this case is being treated just like every other
case and not with some sort of political favoritism based on a conflict
of interest.
This morning, I questioned the Attorney General about recent reports
that the Department has granted immunity to the staffer who set up
Secretary Clinton's private server.
So anybody listening understands, the only reason immunity would be
granted in a criminal investigation is if somebody invokes their Fifth
Amendment rights against self-incrimination. But if given immunity,
then that individual must cooperate with law enforcement authorities
and cannot refuse to answer questions because they no longer have any
likelihood or any chance of being convicted of that crime, having been
granted immunity.
This does indicate that this investigation has taken on a new level
of seriousness, and I suspect the FBI continues to be hard at work
trying to get to the bottom of this, as I would expect them to do. I
hope this indicates that the Department of Justice is treating this
case with the great care and gravity it requires. They are integral to
this grant of immunity because the FBI can't do this on their own, and
it takes the prosecutors of the Department of Justice to agree to a
grant of immunity as part of an investigation.
I still believe the American people deserve an independent
investigation, and I will continue to press for the appointment of a
special counsel to that end.
Mental Health Reform Legislation
Finally, Mr. President, I want to address another issue I questioned
the Attorney General about, and that is about needed reforms to our
mental health system. I believe I repeated to her today--I have
repeated this story so many times, I sometimes forget when I have said
it before. But I recently had a chance to meet with a number of major
county sheriffs, and somebody asked me: Would you like to meet the
largest mental health provider in America?
I said: Well, sure.
He said: Well, he is over here. It is the sheriff of Los Angeles
County.
So the fact is, many people incarcerated in our jails are suffering
from mental illness, and they may have committed petty crimes, such as
trespassing and the like, but they are not getting their condition
treated as long as they are warehoused in jails. Many communities, such
as my hometown of San Antonio, TX, have created a model of how to
divert people from jail to get their mental health issues treated and
at the same time make sure we don't continue this turnstile of people
coming in and out of our jails when their underlying mental illness
problems are not being treated.
I asked her to take a look at a bill I introduced, the Mental Health
and Safe Communities Act, which is designed to help communities and
families who are struggling to help their loved ones who are mentally
ill. Many families don't have access to adequate treatment or lack the
resources to comply with doctors' orders.
The fact is, back in the nineties, back when a major policy change
was made in America and people were essentially turned out of
institutions where the mentally ill were treated, there wasn't any
followup to make sure there was some sort of safety net or some follow-
on treatment to make sure their needs were taken care of.
Today, any of us who have walked down the street in a major American
city know we have a lot of homeless people living on our streets who
are essentially suffering from some form or another of mental illness,
and their
[[Page S1373]]
needs are not being addressed. Some of them, perhaps because they
abused alcohol or other drugs in order to try to medicate or take care
of their problems on their own, end up committing crimes of one type or
another, not necessarily what I would call a serious crime but serious
enough to get them arrested and put in jail.
I am hopeful that we will take this opportunity, as we are looking at
our criminal justice system at large, along with prison reform and
legislation that passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee--which I
hope will soon come to the floor of the Senate--to deal with issues
like this confluence of mental health and criminal justice in a way
that is more enlightened, in a way that is cheaper, and in a way that
is more humane and more efficient than simply warehousing people who
are mentally ill in our criminal justice system.
We can do better, and I am hopeful that models like those in Bexar
County, TX, where mentally ill persons are able to find programs that
actually help them solve their underlying problem--those kinds of
models are helpful to the rest of the country and to us as we try to
craft means for our communities to better care for those suffering from
mental illness.
I look forward to moving this legislation soon. The chairman of the
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Alexander,
tells me he has been working with Senator Murray, his ranking member,
along with Senator Cassidy and Senator Murphy, on another piece of
legislation that they are proposing on mental health. My hope is that
the group of us who are interested in this issue can cobble together a
consensus piece of legislation which the majority leader could then
bring to the floor of the Senate to let us do some additional important
bipartisan work to help address this problem.
I don't see any Senator wishing to speak, so I suggest the absence of
a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Cuba
Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, after decades of isolation, we are seeing a
measured shift in our policy toward Cuba. We have resumed diplomatic
relations, expanded travel opportunities, lifted caps on financial
assistance between families, and eased trade restrictions.
I congratulate the administration for spearheading these changes. It
took courage to embark on this path. These policy changes are supported
by the vast majority of Cuban Americans. They are applauded by sector
after sector of the U.S. business community, and they are welcomed by
Americans at large, but still it took someone to lead and President
Obama did. I applaud him and his administration for doing so.
Make no mistake, conditions are improving for the Cuban people
because of these changes. There are some who do not fully appreciate
the meaningfulness of this opening to Cuba. They maintain that we have
somehow offered concessions to the Cuban Government without benefit to
the United States or to the Cuban people. Some contend that we have
moved prematurely when human rights issues remain unresolved in Cuba.
To be clear, human rights abuses persist in Cuba. We all seek to
remedy these abuses. Yet extending 50 years as the Cuban Government's
convenient scapegoat for the failure of socialism is unlikely to yield
gains in human rights in the future any more than our policies have
done in the past. Instead, this opening to Cuba takes full advantage of
the opportunities presented by the failures of socialism. Recognizing
the inherent right of Americans to travel to Cuba isn't a concession to
dictators. It is an expression of freedom. It is Americans who are
penalized by our travel ban, not the Cuban Government.
During my first visit to Cuba in 2001, I told the Cuban Foreign
Minister in a meeting in Havana that I was attempting to lift the U.S.
travel ban. I added, if the Cuban Government didn't improve its human
rights effort, I would seek to lift the entire trade embargo. It was
taken as an attempt at humor, of course, but for me it was no joke. I
have always believed that denying Americans the ability to travel to
and trade with Cuba has done more to extend dictatorial rule on that
island than any other policy we could have adopted.
For far too long U.S. administrations, both Republican and
Democratic, have insisted that U.S. measures, such as ending the travel
ban or easing the trade embargo, must be met by moves by the Cuban
Government to improve the human rights condition of the citizenry. I
understand this instinct, but I will submit that ending the travel ban
and easing the trade embargo, even when done unilaterally, leads to
better human rights conditions in Cuba.
Milton Friedman wrote that economic freedom is ``an indispensable
means toward the achievement of political freedom.'' Far from being
concessions to dictators, changes in our policy toward Cuba are
reinforcing and advancing opportunities for Cubans in the private
sector. Citizens who are totally dependent on government for their
livelihood are subject to the whims of all-powerful leaders in a way
that those who are economically independent are not.
In a very real sense in Cuba, the economic agenda is the human rights
agenda. Recognizing its precarious economic position in recent years,
the cash-strapped Castro regime has laid off thousands of government
workers and expanded legal opportunities in the private sector. This
has given way to a dramatic rise in the number of entrepreneurs on the
island who are running restaurants, bed and breakfasts, taxi services,
barbershops, beauty salons, and much more. In fact, it is estimated
that as many as one-third of Cuba's 5 million workers are now operating
in Cuba's private sector. This exponential expansion of Cuba's
entrepreneurial class would not have happened were it not for U.S.
policy changes in 2009 that has led to an explosion of travel and
remittances among Cuban Americans. Some suggest that remittances to the
island are responsible for 70 to 80 percent of the capital used in
small businesses in Cuba.
Recent changes to U.S. regulations allowing for additional travel and
remittances have further expedited the expansion of the private sector
in Cuba. Additional regulatory changes, such as allowing the so-called
people-to-people exchanges to be conducted on an individual as opposed
to a group basis, would propel this movement even further. Again, this
entrepreneurial expansion in Cuba has not only given scores of Cubans a
better quality of life, it has lessened their dependence on the Cuban
Government in a way that has improved their human rights condition.
The recent bilateral air service agreement also represents a key
piece to ensuring the continued travel of Americans to the island. This
agreement will, for the first time in 50 years, provide scheduled air
service between the United States and Cuba. Frequent and regular travel
between the two countries will continue to open economic ties, and it
will lead to private sector economic opportunities on the island.
I should note that the administration has done just about all that
its authority permits to affect change on the island. In the coming
months, it will be up to Congress to take the next steps.
I hope that we--particularly those of us on this side of the aisle
who believe so strongly in the value of free markets and free
enterprise--will remember these principles as we promote democracy and
human rights in Cuba.
Margaret Thatcher famously said: ``There can be no liberty unless
there is economic liberty.'' This statement is as true in Cuba as it is
anywhere in the world. It is my hope that this principle will guide our
actions as we endeavor to promote freedom and liberty in Cuba.
I yield back the remainder of my time.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
[[Page S1374]]
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon on the floor
to join with colleagues as we discuss the Comprehensive Addiction and
Recovery Act, CARA. I would suggest that from the perspective of
families across the country, many would look at this and say this is
probably one of the more important pieces of legislation that this
Senate could be taking up this year.
If we think about this crisis, this epidemic that we are seeing
across the country with opioid addiction, it is probably one of the
most pressing public health issues facing American families all across
the country. As we have heard from colleagues, this is not just one
single State's issue. This is not just one region of the country. This
is across all 50 States. I always like to think that in Alaska, because
we are so far away, we are so remote, perhaps we might be insulated
from some of the negative aspects of this modern society. In fact, we
cannot isolate, we cannot insulate ourselves from the scourge of the
drugs and the drug addiction we are seeing.
This addiction does not discriminate. It doesn't discriminate against
any demographic, any group. Again, it can't be confined to a single
geographic region. It impacts young people. It impacts our older
people, the lower income people, the middle-income people, and the
higher income levels. Those of us who have served our Nation as our
honored veterans, pregnant women, and even newborn babies can suffer
from addiction.
The stories we hear when we are back home visiting with our
constituents, talking with friends, talking with neighbors, and then
hearing these stories recounted on the floor--these are heartbreaking
stories that come from all over the country, from the east coast,
again, all the way to the most remote villages of Alaska. We have seen
and we have heard the pain that opioid addiction causes. It is
important that we take action and that we address this issue now before
it worsens. Unfortunately, as we see the statistics, that is where it
is going, that is the trend, and that is the direction.
The rates of addiction and hospitalization will only continue to
skyrocket unless we can throttle this back, unless we can get our hands
around it. This is our opportunity not only to treat but to prevent
opioid addiction. Lots of numbers have been discussed on the floor
about this epidemic that we are seeing, and the numbers really are
horrifying. In Alaska, the mortality rates related to opioid and heroin
abuse have more than tripled since 2008. In 2015, we had 33 Alaskans
die from heroin overdose--perhaps even more that we just haven't been
able to identify. The rates on inpatient hospitalization for heroin and
opioid poisoning have nearly doubled since 2008. The cost is over
millions of dollars.
As we know, it is often our young people who suffer from addiction
the most, and certainly the most directly. Between 2008 and 2013, the
rate of individuals between 21 and 29 years old being admitted to
treatment centers has doubled. Again, we are talking about numbers, and
we are talking about statistics. But we are really not. We are talking
about our friends, we are talking about family, and we are talking
about neighbors. But we can make a difference if we provide the
resources and if we provide the education and the outreach, not just to
young people but to all, so that they understand the dangers of opioid
addiction.
Unfortunately, some of what we have seen with this addiction is that
somehow or another, opioids are viewed as less a health threat because
they are prescription. What CARA does, what this legislation in front
of us does, is to help address the educational need, provide States and
communities with grant options and resources to ensure that all in the
community--the educators, the parents, the doctors, other members of
the community--have the knowledge and have the tools they need to guide
and support young people and the community at large. But it is just so
hard; it has been so hard to see families and friends lose their loved
ones to addiction.
Over the past several months in the community of Juneau, our State
capital, there have been a series of newspaper articles that have
chronicled how that community has been impacted by the loss of young
people due to heroin. Six young people, all under the age of 30, were
lost last year. In September, a young man who was a softball player
lost his life due to heroin overdose. Two weeks after that, another
family lost a son who was going to film school.
You read the stories, you read the details about the lives of these
young people, who could be like any of us until something happens. And
what that something is is an exposure to opioids and an addiction that,
again, cuts a life short. Those parents of these young people, as
parents in States all across the Nation, grieve for the loss of their
children and wonder what they could have done to perhaps help save
their child's life. Again, the community of Juneau is recounting that,
but it is all over our communities.
This drug addiction knows no boundaries. It seeps into and corrodes
Alaska's most remote and rural communities. These are communities, I
will remind you, where it is not like there is easy access to them.
These are communities--80 percent of the communities in the State of
Alaska are not connected by road. In order to get to them, particularly
this time of year, the only way to get in is to fly in. It is expensive
to fly in. In the summer, there are water options, but that too is
expensive. So while it is difficult for people to move in and out,
somehow or another the drugs are coming in and out. The heroin and the
opioid addiction have found their way into these remote communities,
leaving families and loved ones scrambling and desperate as they try to
help those whom they love.
Unfortunately, the resources we have in terms of any form of
treatment centers are so incredibly limited. In one of the communities
that is on the road system, the community of Palmer, just north of
Anchorage, our largest city, I was at an event this summer. Lots of
people wanted to talk to me at this picnic. There was a woman with her
daughter who was in her early twenties, and that woman waited
patiently, patiently, patiently to be able to speak with me alone. She
asked to go off into a corner of the outdoor area that we were in so
that she could speak to me about her daughter's situation. Her daughter
was an addict. She had been in and out of jail. She had been in and out
of treatment. Nothing had worked, and this mother had no place else to
go, no place else for her daughter to go. So she, as one mom who cared,
was trying to help raise awareness of the lack of facilities, the lack
of treatment, and the lack of options for so many in her situation. You
listen to stories like that, and you realize that we must attempt to do
all we can.
Granted, we are sitting here in Washington, DC. The Federal
Government doesn't always know what is best. We know that for a fact,
but how is it that we can help these families, these communities, as
they deal with, again, this scourge that has afflicted so many?
We have had some good news in the State of Alaska. Just this week,
the Alaska State House of Representatives passed a bill that will
remove civil liabilities for providing or administering the drug
naloxone to treat opioid and heroin overdose. It was actually the
representative from Juneau, Representative Munoz, who spoke to the need
for reform and helped lead this important measure. That is on its way
to the Governor's desk. Again, I think it is an important option for
lifesaving treatment.
As we work together--those of us who have cosponsored the CARA bill
and all who have expressed their concern--we know we need to keep the
pressure on. We need to keep the momentum up to address this, not only
in Alaska but around the country, to fight back, to deal with this
addiction we are seeing, and to really attack the issue from every
degree. From mental health to criminal justice reform, community
programs, educational resources, tools for veterans and pregnant women,
addressing this widespread issue with a widespread response is
important.
I thank my colleagues who have led on this issue, and the Presiding
Officer here today has clearly done just that. I thank the Presiding
Officer for his leadership on this.
As I have spoken this afternoon on opioid addiction, and perhaps more
specifically to heroin addiction, I always
[[Page S1375]]
feel compelled to mention that in my State, and particularly in
Anchorage, we have seen a spike of ``spice'' abuse. This is a synthetic
marijuana. More and more, we are seeing individuals who are being sent
to the hospital. It is our firefighters who seemingly are responding to
more spice and more heroin incidents than they are responding to fire
calls. Recognizing that it is not just heroin, but it is other drugs
that are truly wreaking havoc on our families and our communities, we
need to unite together to make a difference.
So I think what we are doing here in this body is a first step.
Passing this legislation is an important response, and through what we
are doing, we can work to change the direction in which, unfortunately,
we have been going.
With that, I yield the floor.
(At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to
be printed in the Record.)

Wasteful Spending
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today marks the 36th edition of my ``Waste
of the Week.'' For those who have been listening I have been down here
every week, while the Senate is in session, addressing what has been
documented as waste, fraud, and abuse.
I took on a major role when first coming back to the Senate starting
in 2011 to deal with the larger issue of our plunge into debt through
deficit spending year after year after year. Despite numerous attempts,
many of them bipartisan, all blocked by decisions made at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue, we have not been able to put in place a reasonable
plan--or any plan whatsoever--that would reduce our spending, balance
the budget and begin to chip away at this ever-deepening cesspool of
debt. It is hurting our economy, and laying a burden on future
generations that will have enormous negative consequences.
Given the fact that those larger efforts came to naught, I have
decided to start chipping away from the other end of the fiscal
spectrum to identify waste, fraud, and abuse, a much more efficient,
effective Federal Government and not waste taxpayer dollars that these
days are hard-earned and pretty scarce.
This ``Waste of the Week'' deals with not as substantive an issue as
many of these. The speeches talk about a whole range of issues that are
taking a lot of taxpayer dollars out of the purses and wallets of our
constituents, sent to Washington and simply wasted.
Every once in a while I try to present something that is so
ridiculous, so unnecessary, that it catches the public's attention and
ought to embarrass every Member of this body. Some arguments can be
made about, well, perhaps the Social Security Disability Trust Fund
could be adjusted so we wouldn't do this or that. But every fourth or
fifth time down here I like to throw out something where people say:
Are you kidding me? We are actually using our hard-earned tax dollars
to do this?
One that caught the most attention was the grant that amounted to
hundreds of thousands of dollars to determine whether a massage made
you feel better after an expenditure of physical effort. If they were
asked that question, there is probably no one in America who would not
conclude that. They would say, yes, that works. I'd prefer a massage
over no massage at all. But this grant was used to determine that.
Rather than take a human subject, they used mechanical massages on
the backs of white rabbits. Actually, these rabbits were from New
Zealand. Then they looked at the grin on the rabbit's face--I don't
know how they determined it. Rabbits can't turn around and say: Yes,
that feels good. Apparently they made some kind of measurement, and
after spending about $400,000, came to the conclusion that, yes, it
really works. Well, that caught people's attention.
There are a lot of people who are outraged at the way we are spending
their money. There are people trying to make their mortgage payment,
trying to get to the end of the week for the next check, to buy
groceries, or to set aside money for their kids to go to school.
This is one of those weeks where I want to bring forward yet another
issue of ``Can you believe this is how the Federal Government is
spending your money?''
I am told by my staff that there is a new word around called
``hangry.'' It means that if you are hungry, you tend to get a little
bit disjointed, and you are more angry than you would be if you were
not hungry. I suppose that is something we could easily prove by all of
us just asking: What is our disposition when we are hungry? Are we a
little more tense or a little more quick to trigger in terms of getting
upset about what someone may say to us or something like that--a little
more irritable.
So this new generation has taken this condition called hangry, which
is hungry and angry, and turned it into the term ``hangry.'' The
National Science Foundation said: Well, we better find out whether this
is true. So they issued a $331,000 grant for researchers to study
whether ``hanger'' actually occurs. If you get hungry, do you end up
feeling ``hangry''? That was the question. So researchers issued a
$331,000 grant for the study on married couples. Listen, you can't make
this stuff up. They came up with the idea of giving each spouse a
voodoo doll, and if they felt they were angry, they were to take a pin
and stick it into the voodoo doll. They each had their own voodoo doll.
Like I said, you can't make this stuff up. It only cost $331,000.
So whenever a spouse made the other spouse angry, the other spouse
grabbed the voodoo doll and grabbed a pin and stuck it in. The
conclusion was after a 3-year study and $331,000 spent--yup, we proved
it. ``Hanger'' occurs when you are hungry.
There are some Senate pages who are trying to hold back their
laughter. I see a lot of smiles on the faces of people in this Chamber
saying: Surely, this can't be true. Surely, this is made up. Surely,
this is a spoof to try to prove a point. This actually happened, folks.
This actually happened.
The serious part of this is that the taxpayer paid for it. At a time
when we are trying to repair roads and bridges, when we are trying to
put money forward for health care research, when we are dealing with
terrorist issues to make sure our national security is strong, when our
military is underfunded, when we are trying to deal with all the issues
of the day, we are taking this money--and of all things the National
Science Foundation could do, they do this.
We take the $331,000 and add it to our ever-growing accumulation of
documented waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars. We have now
risen to a position of $157,591 million and change. It is not small
stuff. It adds up. This is what your Federal Government is doing, and
we wonder why the American people are frustrated. We wonder why they
are angry when they hear issues like this.
I am not trying to stoke the flames and make the American people more
``hangry.'' I am simply trying to expose this so we will be so
embarrassed with these kinds of things that people will come down to
this Chamber and offer legislation to clean up this stuff. We have
already made some progress but we can make more.
Migration Crisis in Europe
Mr. President, I would like to reserve some time to talk about
something that I think is very serious, to discuss an issue that I
think has an impact on all of us, particularly our national security.
Last week NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Philip Breedlove,
whom I have had the opportunity to talk to a number of times, testified
before the Senate Armed Services Committee about how he views the
threats facing us today and what the most serious threats are to the
United States. Featured among them was a serious migration crisis that
is destabilizing our European allies. He said:
Europe faces the daunting challenge of mass migration
spurred by state instability and state collapse. The influx
of people is
[[Page S1376]]
masking the movements of criminals, terrorists, and foreign
fighters. Within this mix, ISIS [or ISIL] . . . is spreading
like a cancer, taking advantage of paths of least resistance,
threatening European nations and our own [nation] with
terrorist attacks.
Each day as we watch on television or read in the papers, this
migration crisis continues to grow worse. Efforts by the European Union
to stem the tide have failed to even slow down the flow of refugees and
migrants. These repeated failures, now moving into its second year, are
threatening to break the European Union apart as each member country
resorts to a ``fortress Europe'' mentality, enforced by national means.
These include new razor wire barriers along internal EU borders. They
encourage divergent national policies on refugee admissions that make
almost a mockery of EU policy consensus or even common efforts.
The EU agreement on common borders--described as the Schengen
Agreement of 1985--has been considered the bedrock of European unity.
If this fundamental agreement is crushed by the unsupportable weight of
hundreds of thousands of desperate migrants, how can the European Union
itself be saved? That is the question.
Many of our European friends are asking that question. I was recently
in Munich at a security conference, and representatives from all the
European nations were there. The No. 1 topic was the flow of migration
and the destabilization of Europe and the unity of Europe, nations not
abiding by their earlier commitments to receive migrants, nations
raising barriers and building walls--whether they are razor wire or
concrete walls--around their borders. It is creating a major crisis in
Europe.
The political stability and social cohesion of individual European
states are clearly under strain. We have seen street riots and police
suppression. Growing hostility between citizens and migrant groups is
spreading like wildfire. Extremist political groups are feeding on this
chaos and further threatening democratic institutions. Even in Germany,
an extremist rightwing, basically fascist party has grown its
population from zero 4 years ago to 15 percent to 20 percent today,
taking over in many places as the third largest party in Germany. We
all know that after key state elections this weekend, this may be
growing.
The latest EU effort to come to grips with this enormous problem is
continuing at a summit meeting this week in Brussels, with attendance
by Turkey. The draft agreement on the table shows how desperate the
Europeans have become. Without discussing the detailed items here, it
is sufficient to note that the central proposition under consideration
is this: a convoluted system to send some migrant refugees from Greece
back to Turkey in exchange for other migrants to be resettled directly
from Turkey to European countries. The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees and other refugee organizations have denounced this
proposal as unworkable and illegal. Some EU countries, such as Hungary,
have even promised to veto this scheme.
Without entirely prejudging a proposal still under consideration, I
nevertheless have to guess that even if it is accepted and enacted, it
is unlikely to address meaningfully the real dimensions of this
migration problem. Something else clearly has to be done. The numbers
that are coming in show an ever-expanding number of migrants seeking
relief by taking treacherous routes--many of them guided by criminal
elements--into Europe and the European resistance and the instability
all of that has provided.
The draft EU-Turkey agreement does include a commitment to pursue
another idea, and that is what I want to talk about on the floor this
afternoon. I have long advocated this as hopefully a more workable
condition; that is, to create conditions in and near Syria that will
permit people to remain there in humane conditions of relative safety
near their home country, within their own culture. To my knowledge,
European leaders as a group have not before committed to pursue this
solution, but I have raised it with European leaders personally. The
response has often considered the caution that Europe would not be
willing to commit the resources necessary for such a solution. I agree
that the resources required would be considerable and that the
political courage required would be even greater, but, I have argued,
what is the alternative? Until political leaders in Europe, and here as
well, see that creating safe areas in and near Syria is the only
possible solution to this migration crisis, the political courage and
vision to take it up will be absent. But now, at least, the Europeans,
having failed at a number of other efforts to address this
destabilizing problem, are talking about it.
It has always been clear to me that such a solution is far beyond the
capacity of Europe alone. It will require the United States and other
cooperating powers to work with our European partners to create areas
in and near Syria where Syrians can find safety and humanitarian
relief.
As difficult as this task sounds--and surely it is--it has been done
before. There is a precedent here. The manner in which the
international community eventually came to deal successfully with the
Bosnian war in the 1990s gives us a useful template for how we can
approach the safe-area task in Syria. That template, derived from our
Bosnia experience, includes two essential components: the U.N. Security
Council and NATO, North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
First, we are going to have to have a clear mandate from the U.N.
Security Council creating U.N.-designated safe areas.
Secondly, the U.N. Security Council would have to create a new U.N.
protective force. ``UNPROFOR'' is the term that was used in the
Balkans. In the Balkan example, that force was comprised of 40,000
troops from 42 contributing countries. In Syria, I would suggest that
such a course would include most NATO countries and especially
neighboring Islamic countries. Russia should also be pressed to
participate. NATO could take on primary planning and organization
tasks.
When I discussed this proposal with Europeans, the first response has
been that no one is willing to put troops in the field to fight this
war. It is important to emphasize that this UNPROFOR would not be in
Syria to fight the war; rather, it would exist to protect the
designated safe areas. The force would have policing functions intended
to protect and secure the borders and keep radical elements out or
under control. That was the model that was put in place in the Balkans.
It succeeded. There were some glitches, there were some problems, but
it succeeded.
Third, it is obvious that safe areas in Syria would require rigidly
enforced no-fly zones authorized by the UNSC.
Mr. President, I have presided a number of times, and when the clerk
turns and discusses the timeframe--may I ask whether I am under a time
limitation? If so, I ask unanimous consent to extend that for just a
few moments.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as I said, it is obvious that safe areas in
Syria would require rigidly enforced no-fly zones authorized by the
U.N. Security Council. I suggested that with its planning and
leadership capabilities and massive resources, NATO should take on that
job, as it did in the Balkans. In this role, too, NATO must work
creatively to bring in the regional powers in a broad, coordinated
effort under NATO leadership.
Fourth, as in Bosnia, the U.N. must mobilize a massive relief effort
within Syria led by the UNHCR and similar humanitarian organizations.
The international community must be willing to pay for this important
humanitarian effort. We should call for major contributions from the
regional states, European countries, and other traditional donor
countries long committed to the humanitarian crisis.
Dealing with so many refugees in safe, humane conditions will be
expensive, yes, but it cannot be more expensive than the costs already
being borne by those destination countries burdened with uncontrolled
migration.
In the current discussions of Turkey, the EU has offered 6 billion
euros to help them deal with refugees, and Turkey has reportedly
demanded as much as 20 billion euros. With such sums being discussed--
and they almost certainly are underestimates--the costs for caring for
these desperate people humanely, in conditions of safety, and
[[Page S1377]]
in or near their homeland, are easily justified.
Far greater costs will be incurred if this problem is not dealt with
effectively. For example, a collapse of the Schengen system and
reimposition of border controls in Europe--a process now underway--
could cost as much as 1.4 trillion euros over the next 10 years,
according to a recent European Commission report. This is the cost in
reduced economic outlook for the region, not including the costs for
infrastructure and personnel if the Schengen system is abandoned.
In returning to where I began, the extra security gained by such a
solution is beyond price.
I strongly believe the time has now come for us to press vigorously
for the safe-area solution to the migrant crisis. The problem is
growing far worse with each passing month. Efforts to identify other
solutions have failed, and the safe-area proposal may be the only one
left standing. Those who are discouraged by the admitted obstacles and
great difficulties in pursuing this solution must simply be persuaded
to take it up with creativity, determination, courage, and leadership.
I have discussed this proposal directly with Vice President Biden,
Secretary of State Kerry, Supreme Allied Commander and NATO Commander
General Breedlove, and senior European leaders. The Vice President,
based on his own experience with the Balkan wars, agrees that the
Bosnia precedent could be a useful guide. The general agrees that there
are sufficient resources if there is sufficient political will. The
European leaders I have spoken with agree that no other alternative is
visible at this time. That they included this idea in the negotiations
with Turkey is a positive sign. I intend to keep these discussions
going in coming days.
In conclusion, I am under no illusions about how difficult this task
would be for either us or our allies. It is an enormous undertaking,
and even when it does not address the underlying conflict in Syria,
which has so far defied all of our best efforts, it is something we
must pursue. However, the continuing flow of millions of refugees and
migrants is completely unsustainable, posing serious threats to our
European friends and ultimately to all of us.
I will continue to press for this and talk to European leaders and
others in our country to see this as a necessary, viable, and doable
solution to a crisis situation that is having enormous impacts on the
stability of Europe and even on the United States in terms of this
humanitarian crisis.
With that, I thank my colleague for his patience and allowing me to
conclude.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.
Climate Change
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am on the floor for the 130th time
in my ``Time to Wake Up'' series urging us to wake up to the threat of
climate change here.
Time and time again, peer-reviewed science demonstrates that carbon
pollution from burning fossil fuels is causing unprecedented climate
and oceanic changes. We see the effects already in our farms, our
forests, and our fisheries. Yet the Republican-controlled Congress
continues to hit the ``snooze'' button every time an alarm goes off.
Every major scientific society in our country, upon examining the
data, says climate change is real and it is caused by our carbon
pollution. So do all of our National Laboratories. So do our leading
home State universities. The Presiding Officer is from Nebraska, so let
me read what the University of Nebraska says on its Web site: ``Climate
change poses significant risks to Nebraska's economy, environment, and
citizens.''
Another quote: ``The magnitude and rapidity of the projected changes
in climate are unprecedented.''
The fundamental science of climate change is settled, and the stakes
of the climate crisis loom large. In poll after poll, Americans
demonstrate they understand the connection between climate change and
the role humans play in affecting climate. A recent poll shows that 64
percent of Americans support enacting policies to address climate
change and 78 percent of Americans think Federal Government should curb
the release of greenhouse gases.
In spite of the overwhelming science demonstrating that climate
change is real and the growing awareness and determination of the
American public to do something about it, Congress continues to
prevaricate. The reason is simple: the power and threats of the fossil
fuel industry. But is this strategy, the fossil fuel industry strategy
of obstruction and denial, actually self-injurious?
Let's look at coal. The coal industry--longtime provider of
inexpensive yet dirty energy--is in economic decline. Between 2008 and
2014, coal production and consumption have decreased by 15 percent and
18 percent respectively. Analyses by the U.S. Energy Information
Administration suggest 2015 U.S. coal production was likely down a
further 10 percent, the lowest level since 1986. Coal is losing its
share of the electricity market to natural gas and to wind power. From
2002 to 2012, net generation from coal declined by 22 percent and coal-
fired electricity, which just 15 years ago constituted 50 percent of
the electricity on the grid, now makes up only 33 percent, roughly, and
falling. Gas-fired powerplants generated more energy than coal in 7 of
the 12 months of 2015. Prior to 2015, gas-fired electricity generation
never exceeded coal.
The top four U.S. coal companies--Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, Cloud
Peak Energy, and Alpha Natural Resources--produce approximately half of
the domestic volume of coal in this country. In the past 5 years, all
four companies' stock prices have crashed. According to a recent report
from the Niskanen Center, a Libertarian-leaning think tank, the
combined total revenue of these top producers between 2010 and 2014
declined by approximately 18 percent.
Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs recently delivered more bad news for
the global coal market. According to its analysis, ``the industry does
not require new investment given the ability of existing assets to
satisfy flat demand, so prices will remain under pressure as the
deflationary cycle continues.''
The coal industry seems divorced from this reality. Consider what
Peabody's CEO Gregory Boyce argued in his company's 2014 annual report:
``[T]hermal coal consumption from the low-cost U.S. regions . . . is
likely to increase 50 to 70 million tons over the next 3 years as
natural gas prices recover, demand from other regions is displaced, and
expected coal plant retirements are offset by higher plant utilization
rates.''
Well, the Energy Information Administration disagrees, projecting
thermal coal demand growth of just 4 million tons between 2012 and
2018. And remember, this was Peabody Energy's CEO speaking last week.
Wyoming's Star Tribune reported that Peabody Energy's senior lenders
are recommending that America's largest coal company file for
bankruptcy, as Arch Coal, the second largest coal miner in the United
States, did in January. Patriot Coal Corporation, Walter Energy, and
Alpha Natural Resources have also all filed for bankruptcy in the past
year.
The fossil fuel strategy of political obstruction for coal is looking
more and more like economic suicide.
In some corners, light is dawning. Appalachian Power president and
CEO Charles Patton told a meeting of energy executives last fall that
coal is losing a long-term contest with natural gas and renewables. He
said this: ``If we believe we can just change administrations and this
issue is going to go away, we're making a terrible mistake.''
Well, what if there is an answer to this terrible mistake that is
also an answer to climate change. What if we could reduce the amount of
carbon pollution we dump into the atmosphere and oceans while helping
communities to transition from coal-based economies to clean energy
ones, helping coal miners. More and more conservative and libertarian
economists are making the case that the ailing coal industry should
embrace a fee on carbon.
The idea is simple. You levy a price on the thing you don't want--
carbon pollution--and you use the revenue to pay for things you do
want. Greg Ip, chief economics commentator for the Wall Street Journal
wrote:
The most reliable way to limit the bushing of fossil fuels
is to alter market signals so as
[[Page S1378]]
to divert demand toward cleaner sources of energy or
conservation. We know how to do that: Put a price on carbon
dioxide emissions via a tax, or via tradeable emission
allowances in a cap-and-trade system. Both incentivize the
market to find the least economically harmful way to reduce
emissions.
Dr. Aparna Mathur of the conservative American Enterprise Institute
conducted an analysis with a colleague from the Brookings Institution
showing a carbon fee could reduce emissions, shore up the country's
fiscal outlook, and play an important role in broader tax reform. Dr.
Mathur points out: ``The fact that we understand better the burden of a
carbon tax and how to offset it for low-income households should make
us more likely to adopt this policy, not less so.''
In fact, even the fossil fuel industry knows a carbon tax is an
effective mechanism to help shift toward a low-carbon energy future.
Six of the world's major oil and gas companies, including BP Group and
Royal Dutch Shell, wrote the United Nations last summer saying they
could take faster climate action if governments work together to put a
proper price on the environmental and economic harms of greenhouse gas
emissions. Here is what they said:
[W]e need governments across the world to provide us with
clear, stable, long-term ambitious policy frameworks. We
believe that a price on carbon should be a key element of
these frameworks.
Harvard Professor N. Gregory Mankiw was chair of the Council of
Economic Advisers for President George W. Bush, and he served as an
economic adviser to Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney. He
agrees: ``The best way to curb carbon emissions is to put a price on
carbon.''
With a robust price on carbon, Congress could help coal mining
companies, help coal mine workers, and help States and communities with
significant coal mining activity. A carbon fee could be used to help
coal companies by supplanting current taxes and fees and funding carbon
capture for existing operating coal plants. A carbon fee could help
coal workers by retraining them for high-paying jobs and providing
pension and health care security not available from bankrupted
employers. A carbon fee can provide assistance to coal mining
communities to help them transition through all the challenges I have
described.
A report by David Bookbinder and David Bailey of the Niskanen Center
said this:
The coal industry is facing terminal decline. . . . An
unfettered chaotic decline of the coal industry would create
major social and economic issues such as deep regional
unemployment and a multitude of unfunded liabilities,
particularly for coal-dependent States.
They point out that there is a way to solve these problems:
Compensation for the losers from government policy action
is an important conservative principle.
It is in this spirit that I introduced, along with Senator Schatz,
the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act of last year. I call it a
carbon fee because none of the revenues would go to fund Big
Government. The bill is a simple proposal to cut emissions while
raising over $2 trillion in revenue, all of which would be returned to
the American people--no bigger government.
In addition to slashing the corporate tax rate, which the revenues
would let us do, and providing families with tax credits beginning at
$1,000 per couple, which the revenues also would allow us to do, the
bill would provide $20 billion of flexible annual funding back to the
people through their States to be used to help them through this
inevitable transition--this inevitable transition. In coal-heavy
States, this money could make the difference for communities that have
been reliant on coal jobs.
Arthur Laffer, economic adviser to President Reagan, called our bill
a ``game-changer.'' He said of my proposal: ``I applaud Senator
Whitehouse's efforts to reduce carbon emissions while simultaneously
offsetting--through pro-growth marginal tax rate decreases--the harm
done to the economy by the carbon tax.''
I introduced my bill to start a conversation with Republicans on how
best to design a carbon fee to help the economy. I would welcome the
opportunity to sit down with any colleague to discuss ways to improve
our proposal.
The coal industry in particular has a clear choice: either to keep
fighting climate action, keep obstructing, keep their head in the sand,
continue to be truculent and obtuse until they crash into more
bankruptcy in that unfettered chaotic decline the Niskanen Center
predicts or they could embrace a carbon fee and use it to provide for
coal communities, to provide for coal workers, to provide for carbon
recovery, and to provide for retirees burdened with unfunded pension
obligations.
Mr. President, I have put a ladder into the water, and I urge the
coal industry, before it goes under, to grab hold.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.
Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, our Nation's Founders fought the British
Empire to create an independent nation governed by laws. They fought so
their children could be freed from the callous fiats of a monarchy on
the other side of the ocean.
Our Founders learned from the excesses and mistakes of European
powers and came together to design a new system of government, a
carefully balanced system, one of distributed powers and
responsibilities, checks and balances. American schoolchildren learn
about the three coequal branches of government and the unique roles
they play in maintaining that carefully crafted balance of power.
A strong, independent, and fully functioning judiciary is inseparable
from a healthy American democracy. Our Founders wisely reached
consensus to create a system wherein the President designates judicial
nominees and the Senate provides advice and consent. This prevents
undue influence or control by either the White House or the Congress
over the Supreme Court. Simply put, the Senate has a constitutional
duty to provide timely consideration of any President's Supreme Court
nominees.
Today, I would like to focus on three distinct and complementary
reasons why we must fulfill this obligation. First, we should examine
the ample historical records available to determine the intent of our
Nation's Founders. Second, we should look at the actual text of the
Constitution and the plain meaning of the words in the document we all
agree represents the highest law in the land. Finally, we can look at
the Senate's track record and traditions when it comes to considering
Supreme Court nominees.
As Senators, we raise our hand and take a solemn oath to defend the
Constitution of the United States and faithfully discharge the duties
of our office. One of the core constitutionally mandated duties of
serving as a Senator is to advise and consent on Supreme Court
nominees, and it is not one we can take lightly.
We are fortunate that many of our Nation's forefathers were prolific
writers who left us reams of documents that now help us understand the
debates and the discussions that led to our current system of
government.
Our Nation's fourth President and the youngest member of the
Constitutional Convention, James Madison, kept a record of the debates
that occurred during those formative months of our Nation in the summer
of 1787. I urge my colleagues to revisit this record as they consider
how to proceed with our Nation's next Supreme Court nominee.
On June 4, 1787, James Wilson of Pennsylvania--a signatory of the
Declaration of Independence and a member of the Continental Congress--
argued that justices should be appointed by the executive branch alone
and strongly opposed appointments made by the Federal legislature.
Madison disliked the appointment of judges by the legislature but also
wasn't satisfied with a unilateral Executive appointment. He ultimately
suggested that judicial appointments should be made by the Senate. This
issue of judicial appointments was debated vigorously and continued
over multiple sessions as delegates traded proposals. Charles Pinckney
of South Carolina and Roger Sherman of Connecticut opposed Wilson and
pushed for the legislative appointment of Justices.
Madison, however, moved us closer to our present system by suggesting
that only the Senate should have the power to appoint Justices to the
Supreme Court and not the House of Representatives.
[[Page S1379]]
Nathaniel Gorham, a delegate from Massachusetts, first introduced the
concept of appointment by the President with the advice and consent of
the Senate. This balanced approach resolved the concerns of delegates
who believed unilateral Presidential appointments bordered on monarchy,
while also addressing the concern that legislative appointments were
simply too vulnerable to the fleeting parochial interests that may
dominate the discussion on any given day.
Months later, on September 7, 1787, the delegates unanimously agreed
on the final language that governs the nomination and confirmation of
Supreme Court Justices to this day. Our Founders' focus on the
appointment and confirmation of the Supreme Court Justices was not an
academic exercise, nor was it an intergovernmental turf war. It was an
iterative, deliberative process with a clear goal: a strong and
independent judiciary.
Alexander Hamilton, probably the most prolific of our Founders when
it comes to the written word, directly addressed the independence of
the judiciary in The Federalist Papers. He argued: ``Liberty can have
nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have everything to
fear from its union with either of the other departments.''
Hamilton was concerned that a Supreme Court too heavily influenced by
Congress or the White House would not adequately protect the rights and
freedoms of the American people. He wrote that an independent judiciary
``will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the
Constitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure
them.''
Tying the hands of the Supreme Court by keeping an empty seat on the
nine-member bench amounts to the union between the departments that
Hamilton warned us about. Refusing to even consider a Supreme Court
nominee strengthens the Senate to the detriment of the executive and
judicial branches, throws off a carefully crafted balance of power, and
contravenes our Founders' intent. Some legal scholars, Senators, and
members of the judiciary argue that intent is irrelevant and that we
should strictly construe the words on the page.
Let's look at the plain meaning of the constitutional text. Article
3, section 1, states that ``The judicial Power of the United States,
shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as
the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.''
While lower courts could be established by Congress, the Supreme
Court resolves issues between and among the States. It is the highest
Court in the land, a Court of finality.
The Constitution specifically addresses the appointment of Justices
to the Supreme Court.
Article 2, section 2, states the President ``shall nominate''--and I
repeat ``shall nominate''--``and by and with the Advice and Consent of
the Senate, shall''--and I repeat ``shall''--``appoint Ambassadors,
other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court.''
``Shall'' is not a word that is considered ambiguous. Its meaning
hasn't evolved over time. It is not open for interpretation. It is not
permissive in nature. It is instructive, and it is clear.
There are many modern-day issues we face that our Founders could have
never imagined. We will grapple with novel constitutional questions for
as long as this Nation exists. But the question of how Supreme Court
Justices are appointed is something our Founders debated, decided, and
they enshrined in the Constitution.
The President is required to nominate a Justice, and the Senate has
the job of confirming or rejecting that appointment. If the Senate
attempts to undermine the President's constitutional responsibility to
nominate a Justice and this body fails to provide advice and consent on
that nomination--well, we then have abdicated one of the Senate's most
important and sacred constitutional obligations.
The Senate has a longstanding tradition of swiftly considering and
confirming judicial nominees. Presidents and the Senate have
historically taken their responsibility to fill the Supreme Court very
seriously, even when they were at odds over who that nominee may have
been. I am surprised and also disappointed that so many of my
colleagues seem to be ignoring their constitutional obligations in a
stark departure from the history of the U.S. Senate.
According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, since
the Judiciary Committee's creation 200 years ago, they have typically
reported Supreme Court nominations that were opposed by a committee
majority to allow the full Senate to make the final decision on whether
the nominee should be confirmed.
Let me repeat this very important fact. Even if a nominee was opposed
in committee, their nomination was still brought to the floor of the
Senate for a vote.
Let's also consider recent history. Since 1975, the time from a
President's formal nomination to hearing has averaged 42 days. The time
from a nomination to committee vote has averaged 57 days. The time from
a nomination to floor vote has averaged 70 days.
The current vacancy we are dealing with occurred 269 days before the
2016 election and with 342 days remaining in President Obama's term in
office. Without doing a whole lot of math, it is safe to say that there
is more than enough time to nominate, consider, and confirm a Supreme
Court Justice before the November election if we move at a deliberate,
average pace, on par with what has existed for over four decades.
If the Senate waits for a new administration before even considering
a nominee, we will be approaching a full year with an empty seat on the
highest Court in the land. Not since the American Civil War has the
Senate taken longer than a year to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.
There is a reason that Presidents and the Senate work together and
historically do not drag out Supreme Court nominations: An eight-member
Supreme Court simply cannot fully do its job. The cases in which the
Supreme Court relies on having all nine Justices to break a deadlock
are often those that are most contested. They involve timely, novel
legal issues and resolve splits between Federal circuit courts.
Legal scholar Justin Pidot recently cited Chief Justice William
Rehnquist regarding situations where the court of appeals had arrived
at different conclusions about the resolution of legal issues.
Rehnquist said: ``Affirmance of each of such conflicting results by an
equally divided Court would lay down `one rule in Athens, and another
in Rome,' with a vengeance.''
Over 30 constitutional law scholars recently echoed that sentiment,
writing: ``A vacancy on the Court for a year and a half likely would
mean many instances where the Court could not resolve a split among the
circuits. There would be the very undesirable result that the same
federal law would differ in meaning in various parts of the country.''
Federal law is just that: It is Federal. We cannot have one
interpretation of Federal law in Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky and a
whole different interpretation of law in Wisconsin, Illinois, and
Indiana.
Previous Presidents have weighed in on the importance of a fully
operational Court. President Reagan said: ``Every day that passes with
a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in
that crucially important body.''
I know many of my colleagues in the Senate revere President Reagan,
and I wish to repeat his important words that have so much relevance to
what we are debating here today. He said: ``Every day that passes with
a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in
that crucially important body.''
In fact, President Reagan was able to make a Supreme Court
appointment in his final year in office. The Senate fulfilled its
duties by providing timely consideration of that nominee, Justice
Anthony Kennedy.
Forcing lower courts to serve as the courts of last resort empowers
congressionally created courts and weakens the Supreme Court in a way
that was never intended by the Framers of the United States
Constitution.
I wish to remind my colleagues that the Constitution allows Congress
to decide how to organize the lower courts. But the Constitution
requires--it requires--the advice and consent of the Senate for
confirmation of Supreme Court Justices. We must do our job so that the
Supreme Court can do theirs.
[[Page S1380]]
The American people have elected President Obama to office twice, and
he has a constitutional obligation and clear authority to nominate a
candidate to succeed Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court.
The Senate has previously confirmed six Supreme Court nominees in
Presidential election years, including most recently under President
Reagan. There is no reason we should not consider any nominee put
forward by the President with a fair hearing and a vote. Each and every
Member of this body has the responsibility to thoroughly scrutinize and
decide whether or not to confirm the President's nominee.
I ran for the U.S. Senate because of my desire to serve the people of
the State of Michigan. I took an oath, as did every Member of this
body, swearing to defend the Constitution and faithfully discharge the
duties of our office.
The Senate must honor the thoughtfulness of our country's forefathers
and respect the independence of each of the branches of our Nation's
government. We must also respect the United States Constitution. The
role of the Supreme Court is simply too important to our democracy for
the Senate to ignore the Constitution and wait nearly a year to do its
job.
Members of this body must fulfill their obligations. The Members of
this body must honor their duty and uphold their constitutional oath.
And the Members of this body must fully consider and evaluate the
qualifications of any nominee the President submits.
I look forward to doing my own thorough review of the President's
nominee and working with my colleagues to fulfill our essential
constitutional duties.
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so
ordered.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Biomedical Research
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last year the law everybody wanted to
fix was named No Child Left Behind. Despite many different opinions and
many different political attitudes, we got it done. I give great credit
to the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Patty Murray, and to the members
of our Education Committee, 22 Senators of widely divergent political
views, for their willingness to do that.
I often say if all you want to do is announce your opinion, you can
do that at home. You can stand on the street corner and preach or you
can get your own radio program, but if you want to be a U.S. Senator,
after you announce your opinion, you are supposed to get a result, and
that means work with other people to identify common areas of interest
and see if you can, and we were able to do that with the bill that
fixed No Child Left Behind. Not only did we reach a consensus that
needed to be fixed, we reached a consensus on how to fix it. The
President signed it on December 10. He called it a Christmas miracle.
It passed broadly in this body and it had the effect of reversing the
trend toward a national school board, of repealing the common core
mandate, and of, according to the Wall Street Journal, being the
largest devolution of power from Washington to local control of schools
in 25 years. So it was a significant bill, and I would argue that no
bill that the Congress enacted last year was more important.
This year, I would suggest that if we are successful, that the most
important bill that passes this body will be a bill to advance
biomedical research, a companion bill to the 21st century cures bill
the House of Representatives already passed. That is because this is
the opportunity that everybody wants us to take. It is the opportunity
to take advantage of the tremendous advances in scientific discovery
that have created an environment where we have opportunities to help
virtually every American.
We are able to cure some cancers instead of just treat cancers.
Children with cystic fibrosis are beginning to be actually cured of
their disease, a disease that was completely debilitating. Remarkable
advances are being made because of genomic research. We have
exceptionally talented people in charge of the agencies in dealing with
this; for example, Dr. Francis Collins with the National Institutes of
Health and now the recently confirmed Dr. Califf at the Food and Drug
Administration. So this is the best opportunity we have to make a mark
in the Senate this year to help virtually every American, and we have
some catching up to do.
It is rare that I would admit the House of Representatives is ahead
of us, but they are. They called their bill the 21st century cures
bill. We have a common objective; that is, to get cures, drugs, and
treatments through the regulatory process and the investment process
more rapidly and into the medicine cabinets of the doctors' offices so
they can help people. They finished their work last year. The President
has taken the lead. He has called for a Precision Medicine Initiative.
It is one of his major initiatives. I talked with him about it last
year. I said: Mr. President, we will help you do that, and the way to
do it is through our Biomedical Innovation Initiative. What he wants to
do, to begin with, is to get a million genome sequenced so that when
the Senator from Arizona is sick--which he rarely is, he is in such
good health--or I am sick, the doctor may prescribe medicine that fits
our own individual genome and not just a medicine that is, in effect,
one-size-fits-all. That is just part of the excitement of precision
medicine. And then more recently the President has announced the Cancer
Moonshot to try to make further advances in that.
There is additional interest on both sides of the aisle in a surge of
new funding for the National Institutes of Health, possibly including
mandatory funding, if it is properly done, which means replacing other
mandatory funding. There is bipartisan interest in that.
But none of that will happen unless we move through our committee and
on to the floor and to a conference with the House and on to the
President's desk our biomedical research bill, our companion bill to
the 21st century cures.
The only way to get support for the President's Precision Medicine
Initiative, the only way to get the Cancer Moonshot, the only way to
get a surge of funding that may include mandatory funding for the NIH
is to pass this bill. Let's be blunt about it.
The good news is, we are making good progress. We are making good
progress. I wanted to report to the Senate that this morning we had our
second markup, our second meeting of our full committee where we
discussed the measure we have been working on for more than a year for
our biomedical innovation bill. We have come up with 50 bipartisan
proposals that Members have been working on to get patients access to
more drugs, cures, and treatments in a safe and effective way. We have
held 10 bipartisan hearings on our innovation project, and 6 of those
10 hearings have been on an electronic health care records system. That
program, we found, was in a ditch. The taxpayers have spent $30 million
on it to try to draw into it doctors and hospitals to use electronic
medical records so that you could take--so you know what your records
are and the doctors could prescribe and diagnosis more easily. The
problem was, it wasn't done very well. Stage one was helpful, most of
the hospitals and doctors said to me. Stage two was difficult, and
stage three, in their words, was terrifying.
Precision medicine will not work unless we have an interoperable
electronic health care records system that has as its goal simplifying
what happens in the doctor's office or the patient's bedroom in such a
way--both with devices and with data--that people can make sense of it.
It will improve the practice of medicine. It will reduce the huge
amount of time doctors are spending on documentation. Some doctors say
they spend 40 or 50 percent of their time doing that. If they are doing
that, either they are doing something wrong or the government is doing
something wrong, and my guess is we are. That is my guess. So we set
out this year to take several steps to change that.
[[Page S1381]]
The administration--and I will give them credit--has gotten the
message as well, and they, including Dr. DeSalvo and Secretary Burwell
and Andy Slavitt, the head of CMS, have made a priority of trying to
take this electronic medical records system and get it back on track so
that doctors and physicians will see it as an opportunity and not as a
burden.
We have several steps in our legislation that will help make
electronic medical records work better. They include giving agencies
more flexibility for alliances like the Vanderbilt-Google partnership
that was announced the other day. They include dealing with the privacy
issues that occur when you get a million genomes sequenced. They
include encouraging interoperability and data sharing that is essential
to doing this. So we are all working together to do that, but it will
be necessary to pass our bill for electronic medical records to move
more rapidly, and it will be necessary for the electronic medical
records system to work if the President's Precision Medicine Initiative
is to work.
Last month we had a markup in our committee where we considered 15 of
our bipartisan proposals and 7 bills, and we passed them all. The bills
will mean better pacemakers for Americans with heart conditions, better
rehabilitation for stroke victims, more young researchers entering the
medical field, and better access for doctors to their patients' medical
records, as I just described. And for the parents of a child suffering
from a rare disease like cystic fibrosis, the bill from Senators
Bennet, Burr, Warren, and Hatch increases the chances that researchers
will find a treatment or cure for your child's disease. That was the
good work in the committee last month.
Today, we met all morning and we considered 7 more bills, and about
15 more proposals were incorporated in those bills. Each of those
bills, the Senators feel, is an important step forward. For example,
Senators Casey, Isakson, Brown, and Kirk offered a bill, which was
passed, to create drugs to treat or cure rare diseases in children.
Senators Burr, Bennet, Hatch, and Donnelly proposed, and it was
passed, to create a new system for breakthrough devices that is similar
to the breakthrough for drugs that Senator Burr and Senator Bennet and
others worked on in 2012, and that has shown such promise and such
results. Everyone is pleasantly--I wouldn't say surprised, but maybe
surprised by how many new drugs have been approved by the FDA using the
breakthrough process from 2012. We hope the same will be true with the
breakthrough process for devices.
Senators Bennet and Hatch offered a bill that will remove the
uncertainty in the definition of ``medical devices'' that was adopted
in 1976. Most people didn't even know what software was in 1976.
Senators Burr, Casey, Isakson, and Roberts had a bill to spur the
development to save the lives of victims of bioterror.
Senators Isakson, Casey, Donnelly, and Roberts offered a bill to
prevent the promising new field of combination products from getting
caught in redtape at the FDA. By combination products, I mean devices
and drugs together.
A bill from Senators Wicker, Klobuchar, Bennet, Collins, and Franken
would increase the say patients would have in the FDA approval process
about treatments received in a clinical trial.
Senators Franken, Nelson, Isakson, and Brown had a bill to encourage
companies to develop a treatment, cure, or vaccine for the Zika virus.
These were all adopted, but for these to become law, we have to pass
our bill. We have to bring it to the floor this year, and we have to do
it in a bipartisan way and pass our bill.
At 3 markups--our third one will be in April--we will consider 50
proposals, and every single one of them has bipartisan support. There
are two or three areas where we have a difference of opinion. I am glad
to see the Senator from Illinois is here because one of the areas we
discussed this morning is one where he has been very important, and
that is to have a surge of additional funding for the National
Institutes of Health. Numbers of us were very proud of the work Senator
Murray, Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, and others did to make sure that
we had $2 billion more in the regular appropriations last year for the
National Institutes of Health--very important.
A number of us believe that it would be appropriate in connection
with this innovation legislation to have a surge of additional funding
for specific projects at the National Institutes of Health but not at
the expense of a steady increase in the regular discretionary funding.
There are a variety of reasons for that. I won't go into them all today
because the Senator from Illinois may want to speak. But if we are
talking about mandatory funding, mandatory funding is already out of
control, and the President's new budget has $682 billion of mandatory
funding in it. It also has new taxes to pay for it, which the Congress
isn't going to adopt. The more responsible proposal would be to reduce
mandatory funding by $682 billion.
In any event, if we have any mandatory funding, it needs to replace
other mandatory funding. And we don't want to create a situation where
anyone gets the idea that mandatory funding is a substitute for steady
increases in discretionary funding, which has happened before. As
Senator Blunt pointed out this week in our appropriations hearing, when
the Congress put in the mandatory funding for community health centers
and the National Health Service Corps, the discretionary funds started
to dry up.
So we have different proposals for how to deal with this. The
Democratic Senators on our committee have recommended $50 billion over
the next 10 years. I recommended an NIH innovation fund which would
create a surge of funding for high-priority initiatives at NIH,
including the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the Cancer
Moonshot, the BRAIN Initiative, Big Biothink Awards, and a Young
Investigator Corps. It would be in addition to discretionary funds, not
a replacement for them.
So my hope is that Senator Murray and I and our committee can work
together over the next 2 or 3 weeks and complete our work on our
biomedical research legislation by our markup on April 6. I hope we can
come to the floor and present to Senator McConnell, the majority
leader, along with that, a bipartisan consensus for an additional surge
of funding, including mandatory funding for medical research in the
areas I have suggested. I have said that we will need to replace other
mandatory funding in order for it to be considered. I hope we can work
that way in the committee, and I hope the Senate will look forward to
receiving this.
I will conclude by simply saying that last year I believe no bill was
more important that we worked on in the Senate than the bill to fix No
Child Left Behind. It affected 50 million children, 3.5 million
teachers, and 100,000 public schools. The only reason it happened was
because we had Senators of very different backgrounds and attitudes and
political differences who agreed that a result was more important. The
same here. The opportunity everybody wants us to take this year is to
take advantage of this magnificent scientific revolution and encourage
the research and the other steps we need to take to move treatments and
cures and drugs into the medicine cabinets and the doctors' offices
more rapidly, in a safe and effective way. I believe we can do that. I
hope our work is finished by early April. I hope it is bipartisan.
I look forward to the opportunity of being able to say later this
year that the most important bill the Senate worked on with the House
and the President is this 21st century cures idea. The House has done
its job. The President is out front. We need to catch up. I am
convinced we can.
I thank the Presiding Officer.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, having followed my friend and colleague
from Tennessee, Senator Alexander has spelled out an exciting
possibility, and I know it won't be easy. It is a heavy political lift.
But what he is talking about is coming up with a dramatic commitment of
funds for medical research for the next 8, 9, or 10 years, over and
above the ordinary budget of the National Institutes of Health.
We have sat down and talked about this several times, and I
wholeheartedly endorse not only his concept
[[Page S1382]]
but also when he gets down to specifics. Some of the things he wants to
focus on, including the Moonshot for Cancer, for example, is one, of
course, the President and the Vice President and the vast majority of
Americans would endorse because there isn't a single one of us who
hasn't been touched by the threat or the actual disease of cancer among
our families and friends.
I won't go through the entire list, but whether we are dealing with
the issues involving the brain, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
neurological issues--there are so many needs there, and I
wholeheartedly endorse what he is setting out to do. On a bipartisan
basis, I will work with him and Senator Murray and Senator Blunt and
Senator Lindsey Graham. We all share these feelings, that this is
something that will be a legacy item for this Senate.
I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership and his
cooperation in building up the budget for the National Institutes of
Health research this year. The $2 billion will make a difference. I
thank the Senator for being on the floor.
Lead Contamination
Mr. President, I would like to address a couple of issues.
The contaminated water crisis in Flint, MI, is a wake-up call across
America. We have to have protections in place when it comes to lead
contamination. My heart goes out to people in Flint, MI, dealing with
the consequences of this preventable, manmade crisis. The Senate needs
to do something to help the people of Flint. We must also recognize
that children across America are poisoned every day by lead, and we
need to do something about it to protect these families.
A Chicago Tribune reporter, Michael Hawthorne, recently authored some
articles on this issue, revealing hundreds of cases of childhood lead
poisoning stemming from different sources in Flint, such as lead-based
paint in federally subsidized housing. That's right--housing we own as
taxpayers, housing we manage as the Federal Government, and housing
which is dangerous to the children who are living there. Exposure to
high levels of lead poisoning can be devastating to a child, causing
irreparable damage. Because the children who live in this housing are
from low-income families--many minority families--lead poisoning can
further trap these kids in the cycles of poverty, violence, and
inequality. Families are often stuck in the homes even after the lead
is discovered with no place to go.
That is why Senator Menendez from New Jersey and I joined together to
offer the Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act, to ensure safe and affordable
housing by reducing the threat of lead exposure and lead poisoning.
Congressional Representatives Keith Ellison, Mike Quigley from my State
of Illinois, Brenda Lawrence, and Dan Kildee have introduced companion
legislation in the House.
Since the enactment of Federal lead policies in the early 1990s, lead
poisoning rates have fallen. This is a big success story. However, the
risk of lead poisoning from lead-based paint hazards found in homes
continues to threaten kids who are living in homes built before 1978.
This is especially true in Illinois. It is a problem in Cleveland,
Baltimore, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and many other cities.
HUD regulations are outdated, ineffective, and based on old
scientific discoveries that haven't been updated. Under current HUD
regulations, a landlord is not required to remediate a home to make it
safe where lead-based paint hazards have been found until a child's
blood lead level is 20 micrograms of lead per deciliter. That standard
from HUD is four times the standard of the Centers for Disease Control.
When I asked Secretary Castro of Housing and Urban Development why
would we have such a disparity--why would you allow lead contamination
in a child four times the level of what the Centers for Disease Control
says is acceptable? He said: I have no answer, and we are going to
change it. It is just wrong. I salute him for acknowledging that, and I
hope to help him in any way I can to change this regulation.
We also need better inspections. Inspections to qualify to be a part
of a Federal housing program are cursory visual inspections. There is
no way to discover lead paint that can be dangerous to household
members or kids unless you have a thorough inspection. In addition to
that, once we discover there is lead in the residence, we have to find
another place for the family to live unless that lead can be remediated
quickly.
No one knows this better than Lanice Walker. She moved out of public
housing in 2012 and into a home with a housing choice voucher. What an
opportunity for her family--a new home. Less than 5 months after she
and her family moved in, her 4-year-old daughter was diagnosed with
lead poisoning. Lanice was aware of the dangers of lead in kids. She
asked the Chicago Housing Authority for permission to move. They said
no. Why? Because her daughter's blood level hadn't met the HUD
standard. It met the CDC standard, which was one-fourth, but hadn't met
the HUD standards. So despite her daughter having a blood lead level
twice that of what the CDC considers to be dangerous, they wouldn't
move her out of her house. So she stayed. Within the next year, another
child in the house was diagnosed with lead poisoning, too, and then
another one. Before she moved out, all nine of Lanice's children had
elevated blood lead levels. Even so, she received permission to move
only after legal advocates intervened. This could have been avoided if
the home had been properly inspected.
Sadly, this isn't an isolated incident. Since 2012, in Chicago alone
at least 180 kids in section 8 housing have fallen victim to this
mismatch in the blood level standards. After hearing Lanice's story,
the Chicago Housing Authority said it would voluntarily recognize the
CDC guidelines, even though HUD didn't require them to. That is a good
step. However, families all across America need the same relief that
will come when HUD standards are changed. That is what this bill is all
about. I commend it to my colleagues and hope they would look at it
carefully in an effort to ensure that public housing is safe.
What did we learn in Flint, MI? We think 9,000 children were exposed
to the lead in the water that has had an impact on them--for some,
brain damage that cannot be reversed. Who will answer for the poisoning
of 9,000 children? How can we answer to the next generation that faces
this hazard if we don't take this important step?
We need to ensure that Federal lead standards are updated in
accordance with the best available science, and adopt primary
prevention measures to protect children from lead exposure in low-
income housing. That means aligning HUD standards with the CDC's
standards and requiring a risk assessment before a family moves into a
home, and allowing mothers like Lanice Walker to move her family
without the fear of losing assistance when a lead hazard is identified.
We all know how destructive lead poisoning is on children and our
society. Yet, our federal policies are actually allowing young children
to stay in unsafe homes for months after they have been diagnosed with
lead poisoning. By updating HUD's regulations, we can protect the most
vulnerable children from the harmful, irreversible effects of lead
poisoning.
I hope my colleagues will join me in this important effort. American
children are depending on it, and they cannot afford to wait.
Mr. President, we have a bill before us to deal with opioids and the
heroin crisis. It is a crisis that hit Illinois and hit it hard. Across
Illinois we suffered from over 1,700 drug overdose deaths in 2014--a
30-percent increase over 2010; 40 percent were associated with heroin.
Last October in Chicago, in a weekend, we had 74 people die from
fentanyl-laced heroin overdoses in 72 hours. The Chicago metro area
ranked first in the country, sadly, for total number of emergency
department heroin visits. This is higher than New York, which has three
times the population. This epidemic demands our attention. We need a
comprehensive solution.
First, look at Pharma flooding America with opioids such as
OxyContin, hydrocodone, and similar opioid products. In the last year,
there was a calculation that there were some 14 billion opioid pills
manufactured by pharmaceutical companies in America. That is enough to
give every adult person in America a 1-month prescription of opioids.
Naturally, everyone doesn't
[[Page S1383]]
need it, but they keep generating these volumes because the demand is
there--not for medicinal purposes, sadly, but for narcotic purposes.
The pharmaceutical industry has a responsibility, and doctors have a
responsibility. Those pills don't move from the pharmaceutical
companies to the end user except with a doctor and a pharmacy in most
instances.
Many doctors are too loose in their prescriptions when it comes to
painkillers. They prescribe too many pills. I guess somebody makes more
money that way, or maybe doctors are not bothered on weekends that way,
but, sadly, it puts into circulation a lot of medications that are not
needed for pain. Some pharmacies know exactly what is going on as
people walk in with scrip after scrip for opioids. They fill them
without question. Many States don't have laws to monitor these sales.
Then comes the devastation of opioid addiction followed by heroin
addiction. I have seen it across my State. There isn't a city too small
or a suburb too wealthy or any corner of my State that hasn't been
touched by this crisis. It is everywhere. Many of the kids that I have
seen at these roundtables who have survived it and tell their heroic
stories of coming back from heroin addiction--you look in their eyes
and say: I would never have picked that kid out of a high school class
to be a heroin addict. Some of them have been addicts for years before
they finally get the treatment they need.
We need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis. We must
prevent drug companies from flooding the market with excessive amounts
of addictive pills. We must encourage the Drug Enforcement
Administration to use their existing authority to keep unnecessary
drugs off the market. We must crack down on doctors who over-prescribe
and pharmacies that over-dispense. We must remove barriers to substance
use disorder treatments, which is why Senator King and I introduced
legislation ensuring that lower-income patients suffering from
substance abuse disorders are able to get the care they so desperately
need. And we must put our money where our mouth is. We cannot expect
real change to come about through good intentions. We can authorize all
the programs we want, issue all the directives we want, cite all the
statistics we want, but nothing will change unless we give our Federal
agencies and local governments the resources necessary to tackle this
complex problem head on.
This bill before us is a step in the right direction. It requires the
establishment of a Federal interagency task force to develop best
practices for pain management and pain medication prescribing, creates
a national drug awareness campaign on the risks of opioid abuse, and
authorizes grants to States, locals, and nonprofits to address opioid
abuse and fund treatment alternatives.
This bill could have a positive impact on communities in need if we
are able to provide the necessary funding. That is why in addition to
supporting the underlying bill I also strongly supported the amendment
that Senator Shaheen offered last week. That amendment would have
provided $600 million in emergency supplemental appropriations to
address the heroin and opioid abuse epidemic. These funds would have
helped ramp up law enforcement efforts, drug treatment and enforcement
programs, and prevention programs through the Justice Department. They
would have enhanced prescription drug monitoring programs. They would
have improved access to medication assisted treatment services to high-
risk areas as well as support school and community partnerships to
create safe and drug-free environments and provide additional
assistance to States to help pay for prevention and treatment care.
Unfortunately, Senator Shaheen's amendment was defeated when a
majority of Republicans decided to vote against it. If we fail to
provide the needed resources to help communities and families in need,
we may be back here a year from now saying we should have done more.
Families in Illinois and across the country can't wait that long.
I support both the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the
Shaheen amendment. But the bill should also address some of the many
issues I have learned about at roundtable discussions in Illinois while
talking to families, doctors, law enforcement, and those who have
overcome substance abuse addiction.
That is why I introduced several amendments that would have helped
improve the underlying bill, from requiring greater consideration at
FDA before new opioids can come onto the market, to creating incentives
for States to improve their prescription drug monitoring programs, to
removing existing barriers to substance abuse treatment for lower-
income patients, to requiring greater transparency on how many opioids
are being manufactured in the United States annually. I am disappointed
that many of these amendments will not receive a vote this week, but I
will continue working with my colleagues in the Senate to advance these
important proposals.
Let me say that one of the things that has helped is the fact that
years ago here in the U.S. Senate, two of my colleagues who no longer
serve really did something historic. One was Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota, who passed away in an airplane crash, and the other, Pete
Domenici, a retired Senator from New Mexico. They required that every
health insurance policy in America cover two things that weren't
covered by many: one, mental health counseling and the other, substance
abuse treatment.
We built that into ObamaCare, so when you buy a health insurance
policy in America today, it covers substance abuse treatment as well as
mental health counseling. Luckily for many families, when their kids
end up being addicted, they can turn to their health insurance, and
their health insurance can help pay for substance abuse treatment. We
need other sources, as well, when it comes to treatment for Medicaid,
but for those who want to repeal ObamaCare and get rid of it, that is
another provision to ask them about. Do they really want to get rid of
a requirement that health insurance policies cover mental health
counseling and substance abuse treatment? I think it is important that
we have it. I am not sure what we would do without it.
The opioid abuse and heroin epidemic is a national public health
emergency that requires a comprehensive response coupled with the
necessary funding to actually make a difference. The amendments I have
filed, as well as the Shaheen amendment, would make important
improvements and provide emergency funding to help families in Illinois
and across the country. Our communities need us to come together as
partners to help solve this problem. I hope we do not let them down.
Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy
Mr. President, I see my colleague from Oklahoma is here. This is the
last statement I want to make, and it relates to the Supreme Court
vacancy.
A group of historians and scholars sent a letter to President Obama
about the Supreme Court vacancy occasioned by the death of Justice
Antonin Scalia. The signers of the letter include Robert Dallek, Doris
Kearns Goodwin, David M. Kennedy, Thomas E. Mann, Norman Ornstein,
Geoff Stone, and numerous others.
The letter provides a helpful historical perspective on the decision
by the Senate Republican majority to refuse any nominee to fill this
vacancy a hearing before the U.S. Senate--something that has never
happened in the history of the U.S. Senate.
The Senate Republicans have said to keep that Scalia vacancy right
where it is--a 4-to-4 Supreme Court for at least a year longer. We
haven't had a vacancy in the Supreme Court for over a year since the
Civil War tore this Nation apart over 150 years ago.
This letter that has been sent to the President will be shared here.
It makes clear that the actions that are being called for by the
Republican majority are unprecedented--unprecedented. They have never
happened--the fact that they would refuse to have a hearing for a
nominee to fill the Scalia vacancy or a vote on that nominee.
One only has to go back to 1988, not that long ago, when President
Ronald Reagan, a Republican outgoing President in the last year of his
Presidency sent a name to the U.S. Senate, then in control by a
Democratic majority, to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Did the
Democrats in the Senate in 1988 say to President Reagan: Oh, you are a
lameduck. You are going to be
[[Page S1384]]
gone in a year. We will wait until after the election. No. They said
the Constitution requires President Reagan to send the Senate a name,
and it requires the Senate to advise and consent, and they did. They
had a hearing and they had a vote and Anthony Kennedy, a Ronald Reagan
appointee to the Supreme Court, was sent to the Supreme Court by
President Ronald Reagan with the support of the Democratic Senate
majority. That is consistent with the Constitution.
I hope we can return to that, and I hope that future generations will
judge that this Senate under the control of the Senate majority party
is going to live by the words of our Constitution.
As I mentioned, a number of prominent historians and scholars from
across the political spectrum sent a letter to President Obama about
the current vacancy on the Supreme Court.
This letter provides a helpful historical perspective on the decision
by Senate Republicans not to give any consideration to the forthcoming
Supreme Court nominee.
The letter begins by saying:
We express our dismay at the unprecedented breach of norms
by the Senate majority in refusing to consider a nomination
for the Supreme Court made by a president with 11 months to
serve in the position. . . .
It is standard practice when a vacancy occurs on the
Supreme Court to have a president, whatever the stage in his
term, nominate a successor and have the Senate consider it.
And standard practice (with limited exception) has been for
the Senate, after hearings and deliberation, to confirm the
president's choice, regardless of party control, when that
choice is deemed acceptable to a Senate majority.
The letter notes that history is, ``replete with instances where a
vacancy on the Supreme Court was filled during a presidential election
year.''
This includes 1988 under President Reagan; 1940 under President
Roosevelt; 1932 under President Hoover; 1916 for two nominees named by
President Wilson; and 1912 under President Taft.
The letter also discusses how President Eisenhower used his recess
appointment power in the presidential election year of 1956 to appoint
Justice William Brennan. Eisenhower, a Republican, made that recess
appointment on October 16 while the Senate was under Democratic
control.
The letter says, ``there was no objection to Eisenhower's use of the
recess appointment--there was instead a widespread recognition that it
was bad to have a Supreme Court operate for months without its full
complement of nine members.''
The letter then shifts from the lessons of history to the logical
fallacies of the Republicans' position that a nominee of a so-called
lameduck President should not be considered. Here's what it says:
If we accept the logic that decisions made by ``lame duck''
presidents are illegitimate or are to be disregarded until
voters make their choice in the upcoming election, that begs
both the questions of when lame duck status begins (after
all, a president is technically a `lame duck' from the day of
inauguration), and why senators up for reelection at the same
time should not recuse themselves from decisions until the
voters have decided whether to keep them or their partisans
in office.
The letter ultimately concludes that, ``the refusal to hold hearings
and deliberate on a nominee at this level is truly unprecedented and,
in our view, dangerous.''
I hope my Republican colleagues heed the words of these preeminent
historians.
There will be real consequences if the Senate fails to do its job and
leaves a Supreme Court vacancy open for an extended time.
As President Ronald Reagan said in 1987, quote, ``Every day that
passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's
business in that crucially important body.''
Major legal and constitutional questions are constantly brought
before the Supreme Court for national resolution. When a case ends up
with a tie vote among the Justices, the Supreme Court's ruling has no
precedential impact and important questions go unresolved.
As Gregory Garre, former Solicitor General under President George W.
Bush, recently said, ``the prospect of numerous 4-4 ties or dismissals
would be undesirable to the Court.''
Millions of Americans are awaiting resolution of the questions that
are before the Court. It is not fair to leave them twisting in the
wind.
Consider the impact on the efforts of law enforcement to protect our
communities.
On February 23, four former United States Attorneys wrote an op-ed in
the Cincinnati Enquirer.
They said:
For federal prosecutors, agents and criminal
investigations, a year is a lifetime. We have seen real
threats, whether it is the heroin epidemic or the threat of
ISIS recruitment, facing the people in our communities each
day. While law enforcement stands ready to protect the public
from those threats, they need to know the rules of the road.
The op-ed continues:
The Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of the hardest
and most important questions facing law enforcement and our
nation. Even as we write today, unsettled legal questions
regarding search and seizure, digital privacy and federal
sentencing are either pending before the Supreme Court or
headed there. It is unfair and unsafe to expect good federal
agents, police and prosecutors to spend more than a year
guessing whether their actions will hold up in court. And it
is just as unfair to expect citizens whose rights and
liberties are at stake to wait for answers while their homes,
emails, cell phones, records and activities are investigated.
We expect our law enforcement agents and prosecutors to do their job
every day, even in election years. We should expect Senators to do
their jobs as well and fill this Supreme Court vacancy.
Earlier this week, 356 constitutional law scholars wrote a letter to
the Senate, explaining that ``a long term vacancy jeopardizes the
Supreme Court's ability to resolve disputed questions of federal law,
causing uncertainty and hampering the administration of justice across
the country.''
Justice Scalia, in a 2004 memorandum discussing the Supreme Court's
recusal policy, noted the problems the Court faces when only eight
Justices hear a case. He said that when the Court proceeds to hear a
case with eight Justices, it ``rais[es] the possibility that, by reason
of a tie vote, it will find itself unable to resolve the significant
legal issue presented by the case.'' He then went on to note that under
the Supreme Court's Statement of Recusal Policy, ``even one unnecessary
recusal impairs the functioning of the Court.''
Why would the Senate purposefully try to impair the functioning of
the Supreme Court by leaving it with only eight Justices?
The Senate should do its job and consider a Supreme Court nominee so
the Court can function like it's supposed to. I urge my Republican
colleagues to do their job. Give the President's nominee a hearing and
a vote.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.
