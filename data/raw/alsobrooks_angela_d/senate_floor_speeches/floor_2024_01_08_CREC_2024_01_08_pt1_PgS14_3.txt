RECOGNIZING THE JACKSONVILLE-ONSLOW CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
Mr. BUDD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the
Jacksonville-Onslow Chamber of Commerce on their 80th anniversary.
Since being established in 1944, the Jacksonville-Onslow Chamber of
Commerce has been a staunch advocate for area businesses and the Marine
Corps community at Camp Lejeune. Jacksonville is well-known for being
the home of Camp Lejeune. Its community is also deeply entrenched in
supporting small-business owners.
Chambers of Commerce play a pivotal role in areas around workforce
development, tourism promotion, connecting business owners, and
advocating for issues that are important to their members. The
Jacksonville-Onslow Chamber routinely performs all of these duties and
has consistently gone the extra mile to help build new partnerships in
the area.
A strong chamber oftentimes requires a visionary and bold leader at
the helm. Laurette Leagon has over 25 years as a chamber professional
and is widely recognized in Southeastern North Carolina as an
innovative thought leader. At her core, she has never forgotten what
one of the most important functions of a chamber is: to do what is best
for membership.
Mr. President, I congratulate the Jacksonville-Onslow Chamber of
Commerce on their 80th anniversary. I have no doubt that this
organization will continue to advocate and advance the interests of
small businesses, non-profits, and other industry members for decades
to come.
