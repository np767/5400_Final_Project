RECOGNIZING THE GREATER FAYETTEVILLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
Mr. BUDD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Greater
Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce on their 125th anniversary.
While it has been operated under various names over the years, the
Greater Fayetteville Chamber has roots that date back to 1899.
Fayetteville is known nationally as a community that is not only home
to the largest Active-Duty military base in the United States, but also
thriving businesses.
Chambers of commerce play a pivotal role in areas around workforce
development, tourism promotion, connecting businessowners, and
advocating for issues that are important to their members. As North
Carolina's sixth largest city, many have taken notice of the success
stories happening in Fayetteville and Cumberland County.
Since being named CEO of the Greater Fayetteville Chamber back in
March 2023, Nat Robertson has been a passionate force driving the
area's economic competitiveness. He came into office with a bold agenda
focused on membership growth, business advocacy, and a true passion for
improving his community. That energy has helped the chamber grow at a
rapid pace in its membership, community involvement, and events that
bring together a diverse group of citizens within the community.
I congratulate the Greater Fayetteville Chamber on their 125th
anniversary. I have no doubt that this organization will continue to
advocate and advance the interests of small businesses, nonprofits, and
other industry members for decades to come.
