ALSOBROOKS NO ON CR
November 9, 2025
WASHINGTON, DC
– Today, Senator Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) released the following statement:
“I will be voting NO on the CR proposed today.
“I have voted eight separate times to reopen the government. And each of those times, I voted for a CR that addresses the health care crisis Republicans have unleashed on working families across this country.
“After weeks of refusing to negotiate, Senate Republicans have finally put forth a new CR that reaffirms their indifference to the health care crisis and growing unaffordability of our country.
“As I look at this new CR, I am glad to see it includes language I fought for to reverse the draconian RIFs.
“But, I have maintained from the beginning of this Republican shutdown that I could not vote for anything that does not address the rising health care costs.
“The first 11 months of this Administration have been a disaster. Marylanders are struggling to pay their bills because of soaring energy costs and grocery prices. Patriotic civil servants have been fired after years of dedicated service. Our economy has been wrecked by chaotic tariffs. And after all that, Republicans have put forth a CR today that does absolutely nothing to help struggling Marylanders afford health care.
“I made a promise to the people of Maryland that I would always vote in their best interests. That’s why I’m voting NO.”
