Maryland Delegation Members Express Support for Governor’s Action to Provide Food Support to Marylanders
October 30, 2025
WASHINGTON –
Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks and U.S. Representatives Steny Hoyer, Kweisi Mfume, Jamie Raskin, Glenn Ivey, Sarah Elfreth, April McClain Delaney, and Johnny Olszewski (all D-Md.) released the following statement on Governor Moore’s decision to declare a state of emergency in order to support Maryland families impacted by Republicans’ shutdown and refusal to use contingency funds for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits:
“With prices on the rise and the uncertainty created by the Republican government shutdown, many Marylanders are struggling to make ends meet. Meanwhile the Trump Administration has failed to ensure those in need will have access to nutrition assistance – refusing to keep SNAP benefits flowing. That’s why we’re glad to see Governor Moore take action to protect vulnerable Maryland families. We stand with the Governor and support this decision to help Marylanders put food on the table, as we continue fighting to reopen the government and end this shameful Republican shutdown.”
