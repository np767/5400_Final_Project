Senator Alsobrooks Statement Honoring Veterans Day
November 11, 2025
WASHINGTON, DC
– Today, on Veterans Day, Senator Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) released the following statement:
“Join me in honoring all our veterans here in Maryland and across our great country today. While we owe veterans our gratitude and respect every day of the year, this Tuesday in November allows us to take a moment, stop, and acknowledge those who risked their lives in service to our country. They woke up every morning with one goal: to protect each of us and the freedoms we hold dear.
“We have an obligation to do more than just thank our veterans for their service – we must provide them with benefits, health care, and opportunities to thrive after their service. That’s why I made sure earlier this year to join a bipartisan group of colleagues in reintroducing the Major Richard Star Act. This legislation would provide full benefits to combat-injured veteran retirees. And I will continue to fight on behalf of our veterans here in Washington and across our state.
“So to the brave men and women who have served our country: thank you. And to everyone else – be sure to thank a veteran today and remember your freedom and safety are only possible because of their service.”
