WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH
(Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate March as Women's
History Month. As this month is also Red Cross Month, I want to
recognize one woman in particular: Clara Barton.
Ms. Barton was a nurse during the Civil War and a teacher before
founding the American Red Cross in 1881. She then served as the
organization's first president. Her compassion and accomplishments are
truly inspiring, and her work has literally helped millions.
Unfortunately, in our society today, women make up less than 5
percent of CEOs and are equally underrepresented in other areas. As a
father of two daughters, ensuring that young women can achieve anything
that they set their mind to is personal for me.
In the 10th Congressional District, we run a Young Women's Leadership
Academy. This program is designed to help young women develop the
leadership skills necessary to overcome any and all challenges thrown
their way.
This unique program gives young women the opportunity to learn from
other inspiring female leaders, such as our own colleague,
Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, the youngest woman ever elected to the
United States Congress.
I encourage all of my colleagues to start similar programs in their
district so that we can all do our part to help inspire young women to
become leaders in their chosen fields.
Of course, this is just a small part of the solution. As we celebrate
the inspiring achievements of women this month, we must rededicate
ourselves to doing more to tear down barriers and ensure gender
equality in our country.
