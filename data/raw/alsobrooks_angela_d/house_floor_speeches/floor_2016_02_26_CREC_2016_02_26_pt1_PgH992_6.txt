BLACK HISTORY MONTH
(Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DOLD. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition and in
celebration of Black History Month.
This month is a reminder of both the incredible sacrifices and the
remarkable contributions that African Americans have made during our
Nation's history.
153 years ago Illinois' own Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation
Proclamation. For 153 years since then, our Nation has struggled to
overcome bigotry and achieve equality for all.
Countless courageous leaders have taken up the cause of justice,
including former Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen and our own colleague
here in the United States Congress, Congressman John Lewis.
Walking on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma with Congressman Lewis
for the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches is one of
the highlights of my tenure in the United States Congress.
As we look back on the accomplishments of the past, we cannot lose
sight of the urgency with which we must address inequality in our
society today.
African Americans today face an unacceptable likelihood of being
incarcerated, a poverty rate that our Nation's leaders should be
ashamed of, and everyday discrimination that flies in the face of
everything our Nation stands for.
In memory of the heroes who have fought for equality throughout our
Nation's history, we are compelled to act. I am committed to fighting
for a more just and equal society. I implore my colleagues to do the
same.
