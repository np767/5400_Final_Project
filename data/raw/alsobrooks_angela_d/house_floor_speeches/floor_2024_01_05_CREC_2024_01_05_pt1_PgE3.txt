HONORING CAPTAIN CLAUDE A. ROWE
______
HON. SHRI THANEDAR
of michigan
in the house of representatives
Friday, January 5, 2024
Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following
proclamation.
Whereas Claude Rowe was born to Jamaican immigrant parents and raised
in Detroit, Michigan, and was accepted as one of the first Black
Americans into the prestigious Cast Technical High School where he
excelled in engineering.
Whereas Claude Rowe interrupted his aeronautical studies at the
University of Michigan at the outbreak of World War Two to serve his
country as a pilot.
Whereas Claude Rowe, discovering that no black Americans were
permitted to be pilots, took advantage of his dual American and
Canadian citizenship and joined the Royal Canadian Air Force where he
was the only black man in his unit who was trained to be a pilot.
Whereas Claude Rowe, still desiring to become an American Military
pilot, heard about the Tuskegee training program for young black
fighter pilots, applied and was selected.
Whereas Claude Rowe, along with approximately 900 selected Tuskegee
airman who follow the vision to outwork every fighter group and to work
for the good of the group rather than for personal glory, accomplished
an incredible feat as fighter escorts: they never lost a bomber
entrusted to their care. The Tuskegee airman became the most requested
and preferred escort bomber pilots. Because when the red tail painted
planes arrived, victory was guaranteed.
Whereas Claude A. Rowe, the only Tuskegee airman to earn two sets of
wings stands as a shining example of a man who overcame prejudice and
discrimination in the 1940s to leave us a legacy that resulted in the
desegregation of our armed forces and the confirmation of American
ideal that all men are created equal.
Whereas, Claude Rowe, will always be loved and respected and esteemed
highly by his wife of 55 years, his 8 children and other friends,
family and community members for his devotion to them and to civil
rights and to America.
