COMBATING BDS ACT OF 2016
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.
Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, the boycott, divestment, and
sanctions movement, more commonly known as the BDS movement, has been
employed as a hateful weapon to delegitimize the State of Israel and
all those who stand with her.
The BDS movement has neither brought Israelis and Palestinians closer
to peace nor advanced the laudable goal of improving dialogue between
the supporters of both sides. Instead, it has served as a means to
demagogue Israel and inflame tensions in communities and college
campuses around our Nation.
Rather than sit back and react to the BDS movement's aggressive
efforts to foment hatred for Israel, it is time to take charge and
simply say: ``Enough.'' It is time to go on offense against the BDS
movement's ongoing economic warfare targeting Israel.
That is why I am proud to announce the Combating BDS Act of 2016,
bipartisan legislation that I am introducing with the gentleman from
California (Mr. Vargas), a courageous leader in the anti-BDS movement.
The Combating BDS Act of 2016 affirms on the Federal level the
authority of State and local governments to divest public funds or
entities that engage in commerce or investment-related boycott,
divestment, or sanctions activity targeting Israel.
Here is why this idea is so important. Similar to previous local
efforts to divest from companies doing business with Iran, we are now
seeing a growing movement in State and local governments throughout the
Nation to enact measures to divest public funds from entities
participating in anti-Israel BDS.

The Combating BDS Act of 2016 strengthens these efforts by affirming
the legal authority of State and local governments to act on divestment
without running afoul of any potential Federal limitations.
This important legislation empowers community leaders and individuals
who seek to counter the hateful targeting and delegitimization against
Israel, and it sends an unquestionable message about where the United
States Congress stands on BDS.
This is not about left versus right. This is about right versus
wrong. It must remain bipartisan. As the author of the Combating BDS
Act of 2016, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle to advance this powerful and important legislation.
