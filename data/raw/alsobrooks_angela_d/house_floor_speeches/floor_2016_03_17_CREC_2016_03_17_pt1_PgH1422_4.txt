REMEMBERING HOWARD COBLE
(Mr. HUDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear
friend, mentor, and former colleague, Congressman Howard Coble. Howard
was a proud son of Greensboro, who for 30 years served the people of
North Carolina's Sixth District with honor, integrity, and kindness.
While he is no longer with us, we will always remember Howard fondly.
We miss his unique style, including madras jackets, colorful
suspenders, and distinctive hats, his humble sense of humor and his
personality that drew people to him.
As a matter of fact, Howard never met a stranger, and he set a
standard for legendary constituent service. His constituents knew they
had a friend in Congressman Coble. I work every day to live up to that
example.
Howard's 85th birthday would have been tomorrow. I want to ask my
colleagues and my fellow North Carolinians to join me in celebrating
his remarkable life. It was a privilege to get to know Howard Coble, to
call him a friend, and to continue his legacy of service to the people
of North Carolina.
I know there will be no shortage of celebration in Heaven tonight.
Happy birthday, Congressman Coble.
