SHAKESPEARE'S FIRST FOLIOS
(Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, just across the street is the world's largest
Shakespeare collection. The Folger Shakespeare Library is home to more
Shakespeare ``First Folios'' than anywhere else in the world.
Published in 1623, the ``First Folio'' is the first printed
collection of Shakespeare's plays. Without it, 18 plays, including
``Macbeth,'' ``Julius Caesar,'' and ``The Tempest,'' could have been
lost.
This year, as part of a national celebration marking the 400th
anniversary of Shakespeare's death, the Folger Shakespeare Library is
touring a ``First Folio'' around the country. Schoolchildren, theater
lovers, and Shakespeare enthusiasts alike will witness with their own
eyes the book that gave us Shakespeare.
During the month of February, the 10th District of Illinois is
hosting the ``First Folio.'' The Lake County Forest Preserve District's
Lake County Discovery Museum has the honor to present the exhibition
``First Folio! The Book That Gave Us Shakespeare.''
This will offer the public a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see
this influential and treasured book and experience the powerful words
of William Shakespeare.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone who is able to take advantage of
this amazing opportunity.
