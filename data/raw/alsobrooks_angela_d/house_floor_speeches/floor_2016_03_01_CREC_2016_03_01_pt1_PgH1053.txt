RARE DISEASE DAY
(Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, yesterday was Rare Disease Day, Leap Year, and
researchers around the world have identified more than 6,000 rare
diseases, half of which impact children.
Last year, the House took a major step toward advancing rare disease
research. I was proud not only to cosponsor, but to help pass 21st
Century Cures. 21st Century Cures is a bill designed to help the
world's best scientists find cures for the most deadly diseases that we
face.
But it is not just the researchers, it is folks like Pat Livney, who
is a friend and an advocate working to help cure Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disorder, and folks like Jeff Aronin and his team working to solve
Duchenne's disease.
Mr. Speaker, every day, scientists across the country are using NIH
grants to discover the causes, the symptoms, the treatments, and
ultimately search for the cures for rare diseases.
In honor of Rare Disease Day, I encourage my colleagues to join me in
calling for more funding for the NIH this year and every year so that
NIH can cure many of these diseases and ultimately save lives.
And that is just the way it is.
