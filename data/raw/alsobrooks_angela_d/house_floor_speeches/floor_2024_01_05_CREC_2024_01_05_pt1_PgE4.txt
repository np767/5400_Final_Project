HONORING HENRY McGINNESS
______
HON. CHUCK EDWARDS
of north carolina
in the house of representatives
Friday, January 5, 2024
Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Henry McGinness,
for his work as an intern serving in my D.C. office. I would like to
take this opportunity to thank him for his hard work and recognize the
meaningful contributions he has made to the office this fall.
Henry is from Norwalk, Connecticut, and is currently a junior at
Georgetown University where he is studying Government. Henry is an avid
New York sports fan and grew up attending different sporting events in
the city.
Interns work with staff to serve constituents in North Carolina's
11th congressional district. Henry was chosen from a competitive pool
of applicants and exceeded every expectation with his positive attitude
and impressive work ethic.
It was a pleasure to work with Henry, and I am so proud to have such
an intelligent and ambitious intern representing my office. Henry
exemplified the spirit of public service and represents the best that
our nation has to offer. I congratulate Henry on this successful
completion of his internship, and on behalf of the people of Western
Carolina, I thank him.
