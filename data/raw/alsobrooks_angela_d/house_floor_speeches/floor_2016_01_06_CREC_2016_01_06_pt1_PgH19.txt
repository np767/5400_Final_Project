RECOGNIZING HUMAN AND SEX TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.
Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize January as Human and
Sex Trafficking Awareness Month.
Mr. Speaker, let's call sex trafficking what it is. It is modern-day
slavery that exploits our society's most vulnerable. Unfortunately, sex
trafficking is the fastest growing business of any organized crime in
the world. This isn't a faraway problem. In the United States, it is an
estimated $9.8 billion industry and, sadly, children aged 12 to 14 are
the largest at risk for sex trafficking. This is absolutely disgusting.
Last year we passed important legislation aimed at stopping sex
trafficking, but the fight is far from over. It is our collective
obligation to do everything that we can to put a definitive end to this
modern-day slavery, which is why we must come together as a country, we
must come together as a Congress, to do everything we can to stop this
disgusting crime.
Mental Wellness Month
Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mental Wellness
Month.
To this point, our government's approach to mental health has
consisted of ineffective and disjointed policies. Too often, those in
need of care end up either in jail or on the streets because adequate
services are simply not available.
I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Helping Families in Mental Health
Crisis Act, which would help the Nation's broken mental health system
and care for those who are most in need.
This bipartisan bill would improve effectiveness and efficiency in
Federal programs that help people, with a focus on early intervention
and prevention programs in addition to suicide prevention. I want to
thank my friend Tim Murphy for his leadership on this bill.
I am glad that the administration this week recognized the importance
of mental health programs in reducing gun violence, but we need a long-
term legislative fix if we are really going to make progress on solving
the mental health crisis in our Nation.
That is why, in recognition of Mental Wellness Month, I call on my
colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill and to stop playing partisan
games with people's lives.
Waukegan High School Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps
Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Waukegan High
School Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, which is celebrating its
100th anniversary this week.
Waukegan's program is the oldest JROTC program in the Nation. It was
created before the national JROTC program was instated in late 1916.
Its initial purpose was to prepare high school young men for military
service during World War I. This organization has come a long way over
the past century, as half of the cadets of this 777-member corps are
young women.
The Waukegan High School JROTC offers a curriculum not only of
military training, but also of good leadership and citizenship skills.
Students receive an education of flag and military structure, self-
discipline and guidance on personal, financial, college, and career
planning. Of the 777 cadets, 75 percent go on to postsecondary
education and 10 percent serve in our military.
Congratulations to the Waukegan High School JROTC for this program
and for leading and being a strong and positive representative for our
Waukegan community.
