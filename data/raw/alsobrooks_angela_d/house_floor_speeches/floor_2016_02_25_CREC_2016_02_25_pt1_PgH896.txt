IN MEMORY OF GEORGE COLLINS JEFFREYS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. Holding) for 5 minutes.
Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of
Goldsboro's own George Collins Jeffreys, who passed away on January 20.
Born over 90 years ago, in 1925, George lived a long and full life.
The eldest of four children, he attended St. Mary's School and Oak
Ridge Military Academy in Oak Ridge, North Carolina. During the Second
World War, George served in the Pacific.
After the war, George returned home to work in the family business,
which was originally established back in the 1890s by two prominent
North Carolina families to market local produce, chickens, seed, and
eggs. The business was successful.
In the 1920s, George's father and uncle took over the business,
renaming it Jeffreys and Sons. The two brothers began offering beverage
distribution. After the end of prohibition, they became a licensed
distributor for Anheuser-Busch products.
It wasn't long before the company had grown so big that it was
divided into separate seed, beverage, and cabinet companies. It
continued growing and expanding in Goldsboro, Greenville, and other
communities.
Today, R.A. Jeffreys Distributing Company is the oldest Anheuser-
Busch distributor in North Carolina as well as one of the oldest
family-owned distributors in the United States.
R.A. Jeffreys Distributing Company services almost every grocery
store, convenience store, and restaurant in the area, supplying 36
counties in North Carolina.
Now, George Jeffreys was not only respected as a business leader. He
was a thoughtful and generous member of his community, volunteering and
contributing to local schools, Scout troops, churches, and community
programs.
In addition to his company being recognized multiple times as an
outstanding wholesaler by Anheuser-Busch, receiving the Dimensions of
Excellence Award, George also received the Distinguished Service Award
from the Tuscarora Council of the Boy Scouts of America.
His dedication to business and to his community were certainly
highlights of his long and full life. But the true foundation of George
Jeffreys' life was his family.
His wife Lucy and his three children--his daughters, Leigh and Ellen,
and his son Robert--and seven grandchildren will all remember him with
love.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to call George Jeffreys a friend.
I pray for God's blessings and God's peace to his family.
