MOURNING THE LOSS OF THE HONORABLE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
(Mr. ALLRED asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Texas giant, a
trailblazer, a leader, my mentor, and my friend, Congresswoman Eddie
Bernice Johnson.
Congresswoman Johnson was unrivaled in her ability to deliver for
Dallas and Texas. She always put Texans first and fought every day for
her constituents in Dallas.
[[Page H25]]
Congresswoman Johnson broke so many barriers. It is not hyperbole to
say that I would not be here today serving in Congress if it weren't
for Congresswoman Johnson.
Everywhere you look, Texans can see the mark that she made on our
State in her 50 years of public service, from improving the VA, to
investing in transportation, to fighting for Texans' civil rights, and
to her work as the chair of the House Science Committee to pass the
Chips and Science Act and invest in high-tech manufacturing.
Texas lost a giant, and I lost a friend. We all mourn this loss for
our Texas community.
