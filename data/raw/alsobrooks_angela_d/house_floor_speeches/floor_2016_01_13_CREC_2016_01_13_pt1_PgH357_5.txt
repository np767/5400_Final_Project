RECOGNIZING COMBINED INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA IN GLENVIEW, ILLINOIS
(Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Combined Insurance
Company of America in Glenview, Illinois, for receiving an estimable
award. GI Jobs magazine announced its Top 100 Military Friendly
Employers for 2016, and for the second consecutive year, Combined
Insurance was number one.
This is a prestigious honor, as Combined was ranked above 5,000 other
organizations in the United States that were considered, and it marks
the fifth straight year that they made the Top 100 organizations.
Since 2010, Combined Insurance has hired over 2,500 veterans or those
with a military background. Their president, Brad Bennett, has
committed to hiring an additional 2,800 more by the end of 2017.
Brad and his leadership team know that servicemembers at any rank
offer employers skills such as discipline, independent work ethic, and
commitment. They actively recruit from all levels of the military,
offering opportunities for former officers and those from the enlisted
ranks as well.
In addition to providing meaningful employment to our veterans,
Combined also gives back to several veteran charities in both time and
resources.
I hope more organizations will emulate Combined Insurance in their
unwavering efforts to support our Nation's veterans.
