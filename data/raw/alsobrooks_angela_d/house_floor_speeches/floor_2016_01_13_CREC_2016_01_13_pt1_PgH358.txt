IRAN TERROR FINANCE TRANSPARENCY ACT
(Mr. HOLDING asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, it seems we can't go more than a few days
without the regime in Tehran once again making the headlines.
From violating U.N. Security Council resolutions to firing rockets
dangerously close to one of our aircraft carriers, to detaining our
sailors, Iran shows no interest in actually wanting to be part of the
international community
What is worse, Mr. Speaker, is that this administration seems all too
willing to look the other way, with new sanctions being announced all
for the sake of preserving a flawed nuclear agreement.
Later this month the House will consider again the Iran Terror
Finance Transparency Act, legislation that, in light of Iran's recent
actions, is absolutely necessary.
Mr. Speaker, now is the time for strong American leadership,
leadership that stands up to rogue regimes bent on the destruction of
America and our allies.
