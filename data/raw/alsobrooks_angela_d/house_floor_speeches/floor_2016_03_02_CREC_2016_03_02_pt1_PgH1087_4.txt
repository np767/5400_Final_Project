HONORING COACH MIKE BAEB
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.
Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize New Trier High
School wrestling coach Mike Baeb, who is leaving New Trier after
helping lead the wrestling program for over 30 years.
When he arrived at New Trier, he truly injected new life into the
program, and I should know because I was a senior on the wrestling team
when he came in as a coach. As a senior and the captain of the team, I
often had to wrestle Coach Baeb; and I have to tell you, wrestling
Coach Baeb was like wrestling a bear.
Unfortunately, I only had 1 year of coaching from Mike, and I
certainly could have benefited from many more. During his time as
coach, Mike won 8 Central Suburban League Conference championships, 13
IHSA Regional championships, and 7 State place winners.
Coach Baeb has also been a leader, a friend, and a mentor to many
students over the past 30 years, all of whom are better off having been
under his leadership, and that includes myself.
I offer my sincere thanks to Coach Baeb for his friendship and for
his leadership. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.
