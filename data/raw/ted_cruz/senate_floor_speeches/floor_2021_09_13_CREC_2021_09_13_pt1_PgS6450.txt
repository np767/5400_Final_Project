EXECUTIVE CALENDAR
Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the
consideration of Calendar No. 150, Brett M. Holmgren to be an Assistant
Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research, and that the Senate
vote on the nomination without any intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
The Senator from Texas.
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserving the right to object for the same
reasons I just articulated--that this position, as with the previous
one, is directly related to trying to clean up the mess, the disaster
that the Biden administration has created in Afghanistan.
I intend not to object to this nomination.
The remaining holds remain in place, and the administration can lift
the Treasury hold and the career state holds anytime they want by
following the law under CAATSA and either imposing sanctions or, if
they don't want to impose sanctions on Russia, triggering a vote in
Congress so that this body can decide whether or not sanctions could be
imposed on Russia. The administration has had that option in front of
it for many weeks. It still has that option.
I do not object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any further objections?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination
of Brett M. Holmgren, of Minnesota, to be an Assistant Secretary of
State (Intelligence and Research)?
The nomination was confirmed.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the
motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all
without any intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in
order to the nomination; that any statements related to the nomination
be printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately
notified of the Senate's action.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
