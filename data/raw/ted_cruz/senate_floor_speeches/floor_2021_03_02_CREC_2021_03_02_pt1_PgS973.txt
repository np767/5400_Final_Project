Texas Independence Day
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate Texas
Independence Day. One hundred and eighty-five years ago today, on March
2, 1836, the Republic of Texas declared our independence from the
nation of Mexico. Fifty-nine delegates who adopted the Texas
Declaration of Independence on that day gathered at Washington-on-the-
Brazos. The delegates adopted a declaration, modeled in significant
parts after the Declaration of Independence of the United States.
The declaration decried the arbitrary acts of oppression and tyranny
from the Mexican Government under the dictator General Santa Anna. In
particular, it noted that that government had ``ceased to protect the
lives, liberty, and property of the people from whom its legitimate
powers are derived.'' And the Texans signing that declaration sought to
protect their rights of free speech, their rights to keep and bear
arms, and their rights of freedom of religion.
Signing that declaration commenced the Texas Revolution, our battle
for independence, where we won independence from the nation of Mexico.
And for 9 years, the State of Texas became the Republic of Texas, an
independent nation. That, of course, ceased in 1845, when we joined the
United States. And today, we celebrate that spirit of independence that
is still found throughout all 29 million Texans
