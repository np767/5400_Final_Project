WATCH: Baldwin Forced Vote to Extend ACA Tax Breaks
Republicans killed Baldwin’s effort to amend the Continuing Resolution to stop health care price hike on 22 million Americans
WASHINGTON, D.C.
– Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) forced a Senate vote to extend the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits for one year. Senate Republicans voted to stop Baldwin’s effort to add her amendment that would have extended the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits to the government funding bill before the Senate.
“My Republican colleagues sent a clear, unmistakable message that they are okay with jacking up health care costs on 22 million Americans. I’m not, and I am going to keep fighting to stop these massive health care price increases that Wisconsin families are staring down,”
said Senator Baldwin.
275,000 Wisconsinites benefit from the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, saving them an average of $585 per month. It is projected that the failure to extend these tax credits will lead to four million Americans not able to afford their health care entirely, including 30,000 Wisconsinites.
Recent polling shows that
78 percent of Americans and nearly 60 percent of Republicans support extending the tax credits.
