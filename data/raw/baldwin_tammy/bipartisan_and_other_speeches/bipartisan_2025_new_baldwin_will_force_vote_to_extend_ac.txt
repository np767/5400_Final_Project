NEW: Baldwin Will Force Vote to Extend ACA Tax Breaks for One Year
Baldwin will take Senate floor shortly to force a vote to amend the Continuing Resolution to stop health care price hike on 22 million Americans
WASHINGTON, D.C.
– Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) will force a vote to extend the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits for one year. Senators Baldwin, Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) will take to the Senate Floor shortly to force Senate Republicans to go on the record whether they will greenlight Baldwin’s amendment to be added to the Continuing Resolution to extend the Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits.
“The health care crisis that families are dealing with demands that we act now. Not in a few weeks, not next month, but now,”
said Senator Baldwin.
“Wisconsin families expect me to use every tool I have in my toolbox to stop their premiums from skyrocketing – so that is just what I am doing. My Republican colleagues are refusing to stop health care costs from doubling for 22 million constituents – so, I am forcing them to go on the record and vote on it.”
Baldwin has introduced an amendment to the Continuing Resolution to extend the enhanced premium tax credits for one year and stop 22 million Americans from having their premiums double. Baldwin will force the Senate to vote on a measure that, if passed, would allow the Senate to add Baldwin’s amendment to the government funding bill and extend the Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits for one year.
