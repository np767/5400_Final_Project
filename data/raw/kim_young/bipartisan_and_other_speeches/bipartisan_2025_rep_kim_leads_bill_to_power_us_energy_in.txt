Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Representatives Young Kim (CA-40) and Adam Gray (CA-13) introduced the bipartisan HEATS Act to reduce burdensome permitting delays on geothermal projects and help expand energy production across the United States.
The HEATS Act streamlines the permitting process for geothermal energy projects by eliminating duplicative federal requirements when a valid state permit is already in place. For projects on non-federal land where the U.S. holds only a minor stake, the bill ensures development can move forward without unnecessary federal delays.
“Energy independence built this nation, and it must fuel our future,”
said Rep. Young Kim.
“We need an all-of-the-above energy approach that strengthens our national security and keeps costs down for everyday Americans. The HEATS Act does exactly that by cutting unnecessary red tape and bringing more affordable, reliable energy online. For working families in California, where energy bills have nearly doubled in the past 15 years, this bill can’t reach the President’s desk fast enough.”
“California’s energy prices are too high thanks to burdensome state and local regulations,”
said Rep. Adam Gray.
“The bipartisan HEATS Act would lower energy costs for Valley families and move our country toward energy independence by unleashing geothermal production. I’m proud to work with Rep. Kim to introduce this bill to secure safe, reliable clean energy, create good-paying jobs and drive down prices for the Valley.”
