Today, U.S. Representative Young Kim (CA-40) released the following statement after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ranked Gypsum Canyon on the Veterans Cemetery Grants Program (VCGP) Priority II List.
“For nearly a decade, I have fought to ensure Orange County veterans have a proper place to rest, right here at home. Today, we are one step closer to making this important mission a reality,”
said Rep. Young Kim.
“Our veterans should not be asked to wait any longer for the dignity and respect they have earned. I’m proud to see this project prioritized, and I applaud the VA for honoring the 100,000 veterans who call Orange County home. I will continue to champion this effort to get it past the finish line. Let’s get this done.”
Congresswoman Young Kim led a bipartisan
letter
with Rep. Lou Correa (CA-46) and 18 colleagues urging the Department of Veterans Affairs to prioritize an Orange County Veterans Cemetery in August.
