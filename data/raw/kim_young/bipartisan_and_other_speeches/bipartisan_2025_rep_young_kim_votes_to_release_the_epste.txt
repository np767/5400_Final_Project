Today, Rep. Young Kim (CA-40) put out the following statement on her vote to release the Epstein Files.
“The American people deserve full transparency, and victims deserve justice,”
said Rep. Young Kim.
“Perpetrators must be held to account, and every survivor deserves to have their voice heard. Today’s vote brings us one step closer to delivering the justice they are owed.”
Congresswoman Young Kim continued,
“My heart is with the vulnerable women and families impacted by these unimaginable crimes. As long as I am in Congress, I will fight to protect women and put an end to human trafficking in all its forms.”
Rep. Kim supported the House Oversight investigation into the Epstein case and has long championed efforts to combat human trafficking. In 2022, she launched the bipartisan Human Trafficking Congressional Task Force to strengthen prevention efforts, support law enforcement, and uplift survivors across Orange, Los Angeles, and San Bernardino counties.
