 She enrollment the increase in weight Couldn't survive here . No, Ans is so low blood. Come on, do the rally! Oh, don't get taken into the process! Well, I just wanted to be here to see John Cox, the candidate for California Governor, and here what he has to say. How about the US representative that's running? I'm actually not in her district. I'm over the hill. Over in Loretta Sanchez's district. Yeah, I know. But yeah, anytime I can get a chance to support any of the Republican candidates, you know, I'm here. I originally voted for Travis Allen. At first, fortunately he went down. So, next one is for John Cox? You think he could help California? Oh, yes, he will. With everything that he did promise it will happen. I wanted to be a part of something, so I just wanted to come and show my support. I just wanted to be a part of something, and we need someone like John Cox in the Governor's seat. We need a businessman that's going to change everything, bring everything back into balance. I'm Jim Sknell. I'm from Fullerton, and I'm here to see John Cox's help us on the way bus. And John Cox, obviously. We are here to support John Cox, and what we would like to say? Well, yes, on Prop 6, John Cox is a big supporter, and he wants to help lower taxes and make California great again. Keep the economy great in California because the Democrats are bringing it down. Big companies are leaving. If you want to keep the big companies in California, you've got to bring the repubs in and keep them in. Look at the big companies up north, they're going into Reno. Yeah. My name is Brian Cah. What are you here for? I'm here to support John Cox. How do you think he's going to help out the state? Repeal gas tax, that's the first thing. Our tax rate is too expensive. I'm about to move out of this state, so we have to change something to get this state going again. Absolutely. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you. Have a great weekend. You too, my friend. Yeah! Come on! Go, go, way back! You're just going to get pushed up. That's right. Hold your shoulder. Hold your shoulder. Help us on the way. What the whole world? Jump out. Jump out. Jump out. Jump out. Jump out. We have a push gun. We have a push gun. Go. We're going to be very careful. Let's get started. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here today. On Tuesday, the voters of this state are going to make their voices heard. They want this state to be affordable. They want this state to be livable. And that's what's going to happen when I'm the governor of this state. We are going to elect John Cox's governor, and we're also going to send young Kim to the U.S. Congress. Thank you, John. And one of the first things that I'm going to do as the governor of this state is we are going to stop throwing money down the train of a train that is behind schedule and over budget. And we're going to take that money. And we're going to give it back to the people of this state. We're going to refund every registration fee paid under that gas pack. The people of this state have been taxed enough. They have been paying so much for housing, for gasoline, for food, for electricity that have been driven up by the special interest groups that control Gavin Newsom, that control the legislature. We say enough is enough. We want a state that's affordable, and we're going to get it when I'm the governor of this state. Thank you all for being here. Let's have young say something here too as well. Thank you all. All right. First, what we're going to do is on Tuesday, we're going to repeal the gas tax by voting yes on six. Yes on six. Yes on six. Yes on six. Yes on six. Yes on six. We need John Cox to be the next governor of state of California. Can you imagine Gavin Newsom being our governor? No. All right. Can you imagine Gil Cisneros being your representative? No. I don't think so. We're going to repeal the gas tax, elect Young Kim to the 39 congressional district. We're going to bring some common sense back into governing. We cannot continue to have dysfunction in Sacramento or in Washington, DC. Ladies and gentlemen, I served you in Sacramento. I've seen dysfunction personally. We cannot continue that round. Drink this one. Drink this one. Drink it up the hand. There's no high spirel that's going nowhere. There's no conductor there. If we stop wasteful project like high spirel, we have money, ladies and gentlemen, to fix our rows and finish that infrastructure needs. So ladies and gentlemen, let's get out there. 72 hours is really critical. It's all going to come down to few votes. It could be your vote. It could be your vote. So don't step, don't sit back and do nothing. If you have an absent to battle, ladies and gentlemen, turn that in today. It needs to be pushed by two states to be counted. Tell everyone your neighbors, your friends, your relatives, tell everybody to get out and vote. That is what is going to make a difference, right? Right, absolutely. This election is extremely important for the future of this state. This state has been made unforetable and unlivable. We've got a school system that is competing with Mississippi for the worst in the nation. We are going to have the number one school system when I'm the governor. We have got to make this state affordable for people. Housing, gasoline, food, it's way too expensive. We're going to change that. The first thing we're going to do is change our government on Tuesday and elect me as governor. And then we'll have a new day in California. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Thanks. Nice to see you. Hey, man. How are you going to get out here? Thanks for being here. I'm fine. You're good. Actually, just get as many people in here. So what would you do?

God bless you. God bless you. You know what? Yes. You need to have more supporting services for people for the intellectuals. You need to have a good disabled person. Okay. And let me tell you. God bless you. Thank you. We just were counting on you. We're going to move to the car after the rest of the race. We are. You know that we spent $500 million on three homes that house 700 intellectuals and physically disabled people. Really? That money could be spent on so many other services for the intellectuals and disabled people. But it's being used to run those three homes, which would probably have a bunch of bureaucrats and a bunch of other people, you know, being natural. We're just going to get that money out to be spent to some more famous ones. I don't know if you're interested. I appreciate it. Thank you. Now for the issue. Run California responsibly, adapt spiritually, use our resources responsibly. That's what we have to do. We're wasting tax waste. That's it. And now, do we have that good? Thank you. We got to get these key turns around. We got to get these key turns around. Seven of these. It's happy to get going. Thank you. I want to thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to do what's going on. I'm going to want to start. I'd like to hear my end. God bless you. Thank you for being here. All right. Let's have that train. Go ahead. Yes. But end that. We do. All right. Thank you. Thank you for all your good work in here. Make sure we have these folks. Thank you all for all this work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to need this thing. It's all broken. It is an investment here. We're going to bring a head bunch交 towards Washington's. You were at the aerospace industry.kiT at Colombia. Good to see you. It's good to see you. Thanks for being here. The business has been destiny in this state before. We have some him RS這個 thing and Rachel's going Yes. Sure, sure. Captain, what? All right, let's do the air service. What do you believe in you? Well, the support president wrote. Well, we need to get the vote out. You know, people have to know that there's a way to get changed. You know what I'm saying? Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In your entrance, can I have a stand-alone? Sure. You know, we've got to have jobs and opportunity for people. Yeah, he's doing an event with Chelsea Handler today. He's doing an event with a bunch of congressional candidates. He doesn't even mention your name when he's out on the stump. Do you think that he's sort of looking past this election? Well, listen, he made Washington the whole issue in this race. He wants the run for president. I want to fix California. We've got 40 million people here who are really struggling. And, you know, I know what it's like to struggle. And I care about what's happening to this state. People are, you know, spending 40, 50% of their incomes on housing. There's nothing left at the end of the month. When I'm the governor of this state, one of the first things I'm going to do is we're going to call a special session. And we're going to come up with a whole lot of ways to fix this housing crisis. We're going to try to streamline the regulations, shorten the approval process, do something about the taxes and impact fees that people are paying. All of these things are driving up the cost of housing. That drives up costs all over the place. I mean, food costs, gasoline, everything that just keeps making this state unaffordable. And it just can't keep going on like that. And last question, this is the end. People are deciding your closing argument, the last, most important thing you want people to know as they head in to make their decision. This is the status quo versus change. This state is so tough for people. There's so many people that are moving out or thinking about moving out because they can't afford to live here. That's the status quo. I represent change. I'm going to cut the regulations and make sure that people can build truly less costly housing. We're going to get our education system improved. It's now 47th in the nation. We're going to make sure that people have water. We've got water rationing coming in 2022. That is not going to happen on my watch. There's a lot of things that have been run badly by the people of this state. By the people who have been leading this state. We need to have the courage. Real courage is voting for something different. Voting for change. That's what I represent. And I think when the people really sit down and decide they're going to vote for change and not the status quo. We're going to have a quick shot of the two of us talking and we'll let you be on your way. Yeah, John! John, I got one question. Go on. I'll see you. I have to make a decision. Okay. Calmedability is Sacramento. Poundability. You've got it. Okay. Okay, so last push, last weekend. Yes. You want to tell voters who are on the side right now. You know, this is about change. I represent change. My opponent is the status quo. It's as simple as that. We've got the highest cost of living in the country, the highest poverty rate, the highest rate of homelessness. Which he did nothing about when he was the mayor of San Francisco. It's worse than ever. I represent attacking these problems and solving them. That's what I've been doing in the private sector for 40 years as a businessman. Getting results, delivering change. The people of this state cannot live here affordably anymore. Cost of housing is out of touch, out of sight for most people. The cost of gasoline is now $5 a gallon in areas of Los Angeles. The political class in Sacramento is responsible for driving up those costs. I think we need a check and balance on what our legislature has been doing. I represent that check and balance. I represent real change. We've got so many areas in this state that need change that I think the people will vote for that. Contrary to what the polls are saying right now, your campaign is saying people will be surprised from Tuesday. I think they will. I think they will. I mean, the polls are the polls. The only one that counts as they say is the one on election day. But I think people, there's an undercurrent. There's really an undercurrent of people who are really disappointed in the leadership of this state. How can you be defending a school system that's 47th in the country? How can you defend 150,000 or so homeless people on our streets that are making life difficult for themselves and for the rest of us as well? How can you defend housing prices that are triple, triple what they are in most parts of the nation? You can't defend that. And a lot of that is caused by the political class. And they have to be held accountable. I represent change. I'm going to work with people on solving these problems. But I'm going to push for the change that we need. Thank you very much. Thank you. We've got to go straight to the bus. Sir. I've got our question. So we're out of time. You have to go to the next one. How do you do with workers? Well, that's just what it's got to do. Here's the worker calls. It's the trial. It's the trial. The browns and the California is going to get used to the fires. Move him. Move him. Move him. Thank you. That's what I want to go through. Yeah. Just over here. There it goes. Yeah. One, two, one. Yeah. Two, three, two, and seven. There it goes. That's what I'm going to do. Oh my God. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Help us on the way. Help us on the way. Help us on the way. Help us on the way. Help us on the way. Help us on the way. John Coffitt Governor. John Coffitt Governor. John Coffitt Governor. John Coffitt Governor. Alright. Can you move forward? Come on. See this. We're heading up to Riverside Park. to Riverside County, in Norco, and Coroner area. We are gonna support Dola Salie, a candidate for the assembly. But really, and truly, what we're gonna do is bring our message. And our message is very, very simple. This state has not been run well. It is unaffordable, it is unlivable. We are gonna be the change that's gonna make this state affordable and livable. We're gonna start by repealing the gas tax. We're gonna stop the train that's wasting money in the central valley, and we're gonna take some of that money, and we're gonna build roads and bridges. But we're also gonna rebate a portion of that back to the people and refund their registration fees that they've paid under this gas tax. We are gonna bring true change and accountability to this government, true check and balance. And we're gonna make this state affordable and livable. We're gonna make our schools number one. We're gonna help the homeless get back into productive lives. And we're gonna make sure that people can afford a home, afford gasoline, afford electricity, and- I can't tell you about the reaction of your bus. Oh, we've got a great reaction to this bus. I mean, all up and down the highways of this state, we are getting people that honk their horns, give us a thumbs up all across this state. I mean, it is tremendous. And you know, I'll tell you the most important thing. You see that first word? Help. That's what the people of this state are crying out for. Help. Help. Help. They don't want more handouts. What they want is a chance to buy a home. What they want is a chance to have an apartment they can afford. What they want is a chance to be able to fill up their gas tank and not have to worry about whether they're gonna be able to buy groceries next week. What they want is the ability to actually take a shower or a bath because there's water available. This is where the political class and Gavin Newsom have failed. I'm done with failure. I want success for the Golden State. And that's what we're gonna have on November 6th. Let me go. Yeah, let's go. Hey John, thanks. All right. Peter means loser and boy health insurance. Remember that. Thanks. Thank you, all the point. You're doing great. Thank you very much. No, we're practicing. But the next generation, better education. OK, check it out. Everything. It's very long. Yes. Come visit Daniel. Hey, John. Thank you very much. All right, go. Hey, how's my job? All right, thank you. Thank you. I can go. I can go. Yes, you have to go. I want to stay here. I can go. I can go. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Good. Good. Let's do it. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. Good job. Good job, sir. Good job. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. Good job. Good job, sir. Good job. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. All right, guys. Let's turn out some boats here. We're ready to go. Second boat. There are 10 boats turning these boats. I go. We're leaving. I can't wait until I come. Yeah. Two miles. Let's get back to work. All right. Okay. What was that pocket pay on the phone? Because it's working guys. They're out here. They're just paying for you. All right, so what's the point? Hi, Joey. OK. Let's sports stars. They get paid millions dollars. We'll get paid millions dollars. But this impacts our nation in such a huge way. Everything is a state, right? Everything. And in these final days, the only thing that impacts this race above and beyond anything is turning in these votes. For the last year, year and a half, in some cases, beyond volunteers like yourself have been calling voters in the field and asking them what they care about. Do you care about this issue? How do you feel about that issue? Do you support our candidate? Now we're in the final phase of those people who agreed with us, who supported us, who let us know what they're thinking and are going to be getting out to vote, right? So we're not in an NFL stadium. We're not getting paid millions of dollars. But you know what? We're walking on the field right now. This is that high stake level of game. OK, the stakes are that high. So while you're here and sometimes the phones quiet, and we're just waiting to get that caller on the line, think about it. Volunteers like you are going to be here all day, every day. You're going to talk to dozens of people by the end of the day. Dozens of yeses. Dozens of yeses. Dozens of yeses. Dozens of yeses. This adds up. We're in a race. We have this office. We have the office in the harbor. We have the office in your Belinda. Our opponents are doing the same thing. We're in a race right now. Final 72 hours. The contact those most important people make sure they turn in their balance. OK? So just keep in mind when you get someone on the phone. Do you support? Absolutely. Do you need to vote? Can I tell you where your polling place is? Do you need to mail in your ballot? Make sure they understand. OK? So just thank you guys for all the hard work and effort that we put into this. And as soon as this is ready to work on a roll. So does anyone want to give it a shot real quick and since you have to. It's back. It's back on. Hold it back on. Thank you. Thank you. I didn't win the step. I didn't have the, what was the, so I saw you. You followed the order. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
