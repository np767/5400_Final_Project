CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF ST. AUGUSTINE ART ASSOCIATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. Rutherford) for 5 minutes.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and
celebrate the St. Augustine Art Association's 100th birthday.
Founded on January 18, 1924, 100 years ago today, the St. Augustine
Art Association has now become the 13th oldest continually operating
art association here in the United States.
The association plays an integral role in preserving and promoting
the artistic heritage of St. Augustine, Florida, the oldest
continuously inhabited European settlement in the continental United
States and has been described as the epicenter of the local arts
community.
The St. Augustine Art Association Art Center is open year round and
is free to the public, welcoming over 10,000 visitors annually. The
gallery hosts exhibitions, concerts, workshops, classes, lectures, and
artwork from more than a thousand different artists of all backgrounds.
Thanks to the art center's involvement, these contemporary artists
are able to keep St. Augustine's present day art colony alive and
thriving.
The St. Augustine Art Association also provides outreach programs
that serve several groups within the community, including the blind,
local public school students, elder groups, and community businesses.
These groups are all given access to the association's user-friendly
gallery there in the heart of St. Augustine.
On behalf of Florida's Fifth Congressional District, I am proud to
recognize the St. Augustine Art Association for its contributions to
our community's local culture, history, and community. We wish them a
happy 100th birthday.
