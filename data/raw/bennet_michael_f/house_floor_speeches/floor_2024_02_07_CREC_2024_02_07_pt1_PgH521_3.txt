ANOTHER EDUCATION DEPARTMENT FAILURE
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, roughly 18 million students fill out the
Free Application for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, each year. Yet, this
week, the Department of Education celebrated 3.6 million forms being
submitted. That is 20 percent, a failing grade in any classroom, yet
the Biden administration considers this success?
Countless students and families are being negatively impacted by this
administration's outrageously incompetent implementation of a
bipartisan law passed more than 3 years ago.
The Department had plenty of time to prepare for the FAFSA rollout.
Instead, it zealously and recklessly pursued an illegal student loan
scheme. The Department's actions have had real consequences. Students
are hurting, especially low-income students who are most dependent on
taxpayer aid from the Federal Government.
The Department promises that colleges will receive financial aid
information in mid-March. Given this Department's empty promises and
missed deadlines throughout the past year, I won't hold my breath.
