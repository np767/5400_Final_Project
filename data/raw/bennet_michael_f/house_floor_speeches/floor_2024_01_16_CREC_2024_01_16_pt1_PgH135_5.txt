ISRAELI HOSTAGES' AWARENESS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday marked 100 days since
Hamas, an Iranian-backed terrorist organization, brutally slaughtered,
tortured, and kidnapped innocent Israelis.
On the morning of October 7, 2023, these barbaric extremists murdered
individuals and families in cold blood. They raped women; they beheaded
infants; they mutilated bodies; they burned people in their homes; and
they abducted men, women, children, and the elderly. These are things
that are very hard to say on the floor of the House of Representatives.
This is an incredible statement: More Jews were murdered on October 7
than on any other single day since the Holocaust. Today, 136 innocent
hostages still remain in Hamas' custody in Gaza.
Our hearts ache with the families of the hostages. We will not rest
until every single one of their loved ones returns home. We are waiting
for the hostages, and we are fighting for them.
That is why I am honored and privileged to lead a bipartisan
initiative in the House of Representatives to highlight the stories of
these innocent hostages. Together, it is my hope that we can bring
awareness to those viciously kidnapped by Hamas, and we can clearly say
with one voice: Bring them all home.
I will begin by sharing the story of Agam Berger. Agam, who is 19
years old, was more than one of 240 innocent Israelis taken captive by
Hamas terrorists on October 7.
According to family and friends, Agam loves to volunteer with people
with special needs and with children who have learning disabilities.
Agam and 135 hostages are still being held captive in Gaza, enduring
incredible torture and trauma.
Agam's father, Shlomi Berger, said that he dreads what his daughter
is going through after viewing footage of her wounded and scared along
with three other teenage hostages.
Hamas should release Agam immediately, along with all of the other
remaining hostages. Our country's strong support for Israel must not
waver. It is time to bring Agam home. It is time to bring all of the
innocent hostages home.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in this crucial effort
to demonstrate our support for the hostages and for their families.
