 I'm so happy to be with you here today to get out of the boat from Mark you know and to welcome our first lady Michelle Obama I want to ask you how many of you have voted already okay let me ask this how many of you because I said so are gonna go home and vote this afternoon how many of you are going to spend an hour two hours 10 hours 20 hours over the next 12 days getting every single person in Colorado to go and exercise now let me start out by thanking you for everything you've done and everything that you will do not just for Mark you know but for all of our wonderful candidates that we have in Colorado I don't need to tell you there is so much at stake in this election and whether it's knocking on doors making phone calls or stuffing out the lobes your help truly makes the difference here's the here's the thing that's new this year in Colorado we have all male voting do you know what that and that's M.A. I.L. but you know what that means that means we don't have to get everybody to get their ballot in just on one day that means we have 12 days my friends 12 days to get every ballot in can we do that you can't tell I'm a little fired up this election here I think you are two or you fire not two reason I'm fired up it's not just because Mark you know it's been such a great friend and senator for us but also because progress on the issues that we care about is so much at stake in this election Colorado spent a national leader in making sure that every single woman can access the health care services we need I can tell you nobody's done more for women than Mark Udaw has and we're seeing the results right here in this state was lower-team pregnancy and abortion rates our opponents not only want to ban abortion they want to cut funding for plan parenthood to stop moving for getting the health care they need and thank you LaGrieve that approach is wrong and that approach is on the balance right now Mark and I worked together to reform health insurance so that just being a woman was no longer a pre-existing condition I can tell you some personal experience Mark's opponent has voted over 50 times to repeal the affordable care act that's just right and that's on the ballot right now Mark spent a champion for our environment our clean air and water and Colorado's wildlife but the Koch brothers and their allies are trying to undo all of this this agenda hurts Colorado and guess what it's on the ballot right now Mark is a true friend and ally of the LGBT community I think we should celebrate the fact that every loving couple in this state can decide to marry some of you might know I'm a minister now I got my credentials online and I'm just waiting I did and I did a lot of commitment ceremonies now I'm going to perform some marriage the debate over marriage rights is not over yet and this issue is on the ballot right now Mark Rudolph has always been an unwavering supporter of a woman's right to choose and her rights to reproductive health care services but you can what you can clap for Mark's opponent has sponsored a federal personhood amendment which like a amendment 67 would ban abortion it would ban many forms of birth control it would ban in re-controfertalization and it would probably ban embryonic stem cell research well guess what we beat this personhood amendment here in Colorado not once but twice and we're gonna do it again let's make sure that we tell the world Colorado will not elect someone who supports this radical proposal to the US Senate this is on the ballot this year now Mark Rudolph has brought our state the kind of steady leadership and skill we need in our leaders and from every corner of the state we are grateful for this I'm grateful for this because I surf with him every day and so what we need to do as Maya said we need to get together every hour every day we've got 12 days and on we the ballots are already out all of you already have your ballots if you don't have your ballots make sure you get one before election day because this election matters it matters for ourselves it matters for our parents it matters for our kids and so it's up to everybody here to do one more campus one more phone bag shift and get a few more friends to vote and I don't think you need to take that just for me I think you need to hear from somebody who's on the ground over in the Senate every day with Mark fighting hard for Colorado families fighting to make sure all of these things are preserved and that Senator Michael Bennett please Isn't it great to have the first lady here you know why she's here because this race is very very close and the entire Senate could come down to Colorado and we didn't make sure that that we've reelected Mark Utah and hold this majority in the United States Senate I don't know if you ever watch the cable TV if you do you probably should turn it off in fact probably should just turn your TV off altogether but if you do watch that you hear these guys at the other side when they're out here campaigning or in Washington they're always saying they want to take the country back have you heard them say that they never say where they want to take it back although it's some century centuries ago they don't say from whom they want to take it back and it's so mad you think that we're losing jobs in 800,000 jobs a month you think that our auto industry was about to slide into bankruptcy you think that all of our bags had closed and that that our savings and our pensions and our 401k's were half the value that they once were but that is not the situation today that was a situation when Mark Utah first went to Washington that's not the situation today we have had 55 months of job growth in this country we have created 10 million private sector jobs in this country 200,000 right here in Colorado where unemployment rate is not 9% it is 4.7% and that hasn't happened by accident and the reason we're all here all of us are here is that we're not satisfied with that yet we don't want to go back to where we were but we want to go forward to an economy that works for everybody who works hard in Colorado and across this country we want to go forward to an increase in the minimum wage forward to an increase to equal pay for equal work no matter who you are that's what we got to send them back but it's close it is so close that this is what I know if we do what we're supposed to do if we do what we know how to do if we do what we did in 2010 when every single public poll said I could not win the race we won't win the race it's not a question of it it's a question of when and that is between now and November 4th everybody in here is more hard everybody in here has signed up I want you to please sign up again for another ship please make more phone call I'm doing it Susan's doing it Tuesday and parkville last night making calls to the headquarters there but I want to just leave you with one thought the only way we're gonna win this race is if we get everybody out to vote so we enjoy me and say it we're gonna win this race because we're gonna vote vote vote vote vote م CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
