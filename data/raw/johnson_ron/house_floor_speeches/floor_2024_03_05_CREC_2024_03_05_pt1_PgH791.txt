DHS BIODETECTION IMPROVEMENT ACT
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and
pass the bill (H.R. 6174) to improve the biodetection functions of the
Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 6174
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Biodetection Improvement
Act''.
SEC. 2. DHS UTILIZATION OF DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL
LABORATORIES AND SITES FOR CERTAIN BIODETECTION
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO THE
MISSIONS OF THE DHS.
(a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall
conduct an assessment of how the Department of Homeland
Security has utilized Department of Energy national
laboratories and sites regarding research and development in
carrying out the missions of the Department of Homeland
Security, in accordance with section 309 of the Homeland
Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 189).
(b) Strategy on Biodetection Research and Development.--Not
later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this
Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the
Committee on Homeland Security of the House of
Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs of the Senate the assessment required
under subsection (a), together with a strategy for how the
Department of Homeland Security will conduct research and
development in coordination with Department of Energy
national laboratories and sites to address biodetection
research and development of the Department of Homeland
Security, including the following:
(1) Identifying biodetection technologies that can, either
individually or together, meet the biodetection mission needs
as outlined in Department of Homeland Security capabilities
analysis and requirements documents and informed by studies
produced by the Comptroller General of the United States,
such as the National Re-Assessment of the BioWatch Collector
Network to Increase the Fraction of Population Covered, as
developed by the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction
Office of the Department in November 2021, and other such
future studies as applicable.
(2) Developing an acquisition and procurement plan to
acquire and provide, in accordance with Federal law, the
Federal Acquisition Regulation, and Department of Homeland
Security acquisition and procurement management directives,
the biodetection technologies referred to in paragraph (1) to
existing BioWatch jurisdictions.
(3) Conducting periodic external evaluations to identify
gaps and potential failure points with respect to such
biodetection technologies, and recommending contingency plans
in the event such biodetection technologies do not perform as
expected or intended.
(4) Assisting, as appropriate and in partnership with
Federal, State, local, and Tribal governments, institutions
of higher education (as such term is defined in section 101
of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001)), and
the private sector, with the development of clearly defined
program and technical requirements for future Department of
Homeland Security environmental biodetection programs,
including any related transformational program of research
and development.
(c) Reports to Congress.--Not later than one year after the
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland
Security shall provide to the Committee on Homeland Security
of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland
Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate an update of
the assessment and strategy required under this section,
including any challenges to implementing such strategy.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. Green) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Carter)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.
General Leave
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their
remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6174.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the
gentleman from Tennessee?
There was no objection.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6174. The Department of
Homeland Security established the BioWatch program to collect and test
air samples for biological agents likely to be used in a bioterrorism
attack. However, there have been ample criticisms and questions about
the effectiveness of the BioWatch program.
As such, in 2019, DHS launched a new acquisition program to move into
the next generation of detection of biothreats and to replace the
BioWatch program with new and more reliable technology.
However, DHS has not used all the resources at its disposal,
including the national laboratories housed within the Department of
Energy.
H.R. 6174, the DHS Biodetection Improvement Act, would ensure that
DHS is doing everything it can to improve biodetection research and
development, including requiring DHS to explain how it plans to utilize
the expertise of the Department of Energy national labs.
I thank Congressman Strong for his work on this bill, and I hope all
Members will support this legislation today.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6174, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6174, the DHS
Biodetection Improvement Act. This bill seeks to enhance biodetection
capabilities at the Department of Homeland Security by leveraging
resources at the Department of Energy's national laboratories.
Currently, DHS' Office of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction, or
CWMD, leads DHS' biodetection work. The premier biodetection program is
BioWatch, which is outdated, expensive, and labor-intensive. CWMD's
more recent efforts to advance biodetection technologies have been
delayed because of this.
H.R. 6174 would move DHS' biodetection programs forward by requiring
the Department to complete an assessment of how it is utilizing the
Department of Energy's national laboratories for biodetection. The bill
would require DHS to create the defined program and technical
requirements necessary to advance biodetection programs, including
critical research and development.
Further, the bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to
provide Congress with a strategy for conducting regular external
evaluations to identify capability gaps and recommend contingency plans
if biodetection technologies underperform.
As foreign and domestic security threats evolve, Congress' support
for advancements in biodetection programs is key.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Strong), the sponsor of this bill.
Mr. STRONG. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Green for his support, as
well as that of my colleagues who join me in introducing this
legislation, H.R. 6174, the DHS Biodetection Improvement Act.
Threats from America's enemies have continued to evolve and become
more complex. The anthrax attack of 2001 opened our eyes to a new
threat landscape that includes acts of bioterrorism. In the wake of the
2001 attacks, the Department of Homeland Security established the
BioWatch program, which monitors, collects, and tests air samples for
biological agents likely to be used in a terrorist attack.
This technology is vital in protecting Americans against bioweapons,
and we must have full confidence that it will deliver timely, accurate,
and comprehensive information to our partners that operate this system.
As a first responder myself, I know the difference that early
detection makes. This becomes more vital when responding to an act of
bioterrorism, which could have catastrophic consequences.
We have worked across all levels of government to improve prevention,
detection, and response capabilities, but there remains work to be
done.
[[Page H792]]
DHS has faced continuous challenges in developing and acquiring new
technologies to move toward the next generation of national
biodetection. This legislation would ensure that DHS is fully
leveraging every tool and resource to accomplish this goal, to include
utilizing the Department of Energy's national labs to develop new
technologies related to biodefense, developing a plan to acquire
existing technologies that can meet the Department's biodetection
mission needs, conducting external evaluations to identify gaps and
potential failure points, and reporting to Congress a defined plan for
the future of biodetection.
As our adversaries watch on, we cannot afford to fall behind.
America's security depends on it.
I was proud to introduce this legislation, the DHS Biodetection
Improvement Act, to ensure DHS is prepared to protect Americans against
bioweapons.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Mr. Speaker, while DHS has worked to improve its biodetection
capabilities, many challenges remain, and the current technologies are
aging.
H.R. 6174 pairs DHS and the Department of Energy's national
laboratories, which would improve biodetection innovation and,
ultimately, keep our communities safe from biological threats.
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this
critical bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my
time.
Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6174, and I
appreciate and thank Mr. Strong for his hard work on this bill. I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 6174.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the
ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a
quorum is not present.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further
proceedings on this question will be postponed.
The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.
