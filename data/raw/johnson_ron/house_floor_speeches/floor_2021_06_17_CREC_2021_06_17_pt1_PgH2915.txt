RECOGNIZING DICKINSON HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL CHAMPIONS
(Mr. ARMSTRONG asked and was given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, June 5, the Dickinson High
School girls softball team capped off an extraordinary season by
winning the North Dakota Class A State Championship.
Dickinson had 13 hits, and Mataya Mortensen's dominant pitching
performance led to the team's first-ever State title. Dickinson's 10-0
win was their 30th in 33 games. Mortensen surrendered only two hits in
the shutout. And senior Paige Balliet ended the game with a walk-off
double to trigger the 10-run rule.
Dickinson finished the season with 30 and 3. They had 487 hits, 110
doubles, 19 triples, and 51 home runs. Their team batting average was
.464, and they averaged 14.5 runs a game, contrasted with a team ERA of
1.42 and 250 strikeouts in 196 innings.
Both Taya Hopfauf and Jenna Decker were named to the all-State team,
and Coach Amanda Mickey was named coach of the year.
Congratulations to the entire team on a great year, especially Paige
Balliet and Madison McChesney.
