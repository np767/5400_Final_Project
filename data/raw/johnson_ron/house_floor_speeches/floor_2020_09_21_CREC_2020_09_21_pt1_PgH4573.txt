The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon) and the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr.
Armstrong) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.
General Leave
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include
extraneous material on the bill under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania?
[[Page H4575]]
There was no objection.
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, S. 227, Savanna's Act, responds to the epidemic of
missing and murdered Native Americans. This crisis is appalling and
threatens millions of innocent people living both on Tribal lands and
beyond.
This bill is a bipartisan effort introduced by Alaska Senator Lisa
Murkowski and passed by the Senate by unanimous consent last March.
{time}  1345
I want to especially commend the leadership of Representative Norma
Torres, who introduced the House companion in 2019 and has been a
constant champion for Savanna's Act here in the House.
The available data indicates that violence against Native Americans
is particularly high. In some Tribal communities, Native American women
experience murder rates that are more than 10 times the national
average. This is unacceptable.
Savanna's Act is named in honor of Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a
member of the Spirit Lake Tribe, who vanished from her apartment in
Fargo, North Dakota, while 8 months pregnant. Eight days after she
disappeared, her body was found wrapped in plastic in the Red River.
This legislation empowers Tribal governments with the resources and
information necessary to respond to cases of missing or murdered Native
Americans like Savanna and to increase the collection of data in such
cases. It also increases coordination and communication among the
Federal, State, and Tribal officials responsible for investing these
cases in a variety of ways.
This legislation provides best practices in conducting searches for
missing persons on and off Native American land; establishes standards
on the collection, reporting, and analysis of data and information on
missing persons and unidentified human remains; and will lead to the
culturally appropriate identification and handling of human remains
identified as Native Americans.
Savanna's Act provides guidance on which law enforcement agency is
responsible for inputting information into databases, guidance on
improving agency response rates and followup to cases of missing and
murdered Native Americans, and guidance on ensuring access to
culturally appropriate victim services.
Lastly and most importantly, Savanna's Act adds two new purpose areas
to two existing grant programs administered by the Justice Department,
specifically, allowing grantees to use funds to implement policies,
protocols, and training for law enforcement regarding cases of missing
or murdered Native Americans, and to compile and report data to the
Attorney General.
In short, this important legislation will help address the alarming
cases of missing and murdered Native Americans in a robust and
effective way. I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 227, Savanna's Act.
Savanna's Act is named after Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a 22-year-
old member of the Spirit Lake Tribe, who was murdered in my district in
August of 2017. Her disappearance and murder devastated the community
and the entire State of North Dakota.
Tragically, Savanna was found dead 8 days after she was reported
missing. Thankfully, her baby was found alive, despite being cut from
Savanna's womb. Savanna's story brought to light the fact that the data
regarding missing and murdered indigenous people, particularly women
and girls, is scattered across various government databases, if it even
exists at all.
Savanna's heartbreaking story, unfortunately, is not unique. A woman
named Olivia Lone Bear disappeared from the Fort Berthold Reservation
just a month later, in October of 2017. She was found in a submerged
truck in Lake Sakakawea in July of 2018.
These are just two recent examples from my State. There are hundreds
more across the Nation.
Savanna's Act will begin to help address this crisis of missing and
murdered indigenous people. The bill will establish guidelines and best
practices for law enforcement agencies across the country. It will also
improve coordination amongst those agencies. Finally, it will enhance
reporting, recordkeeping, and communication for law enforcement and
families of victims.
This legislation is needed because Native American and Alaska Native
women face a murder rate 10 times higher than the national average.
Shockingly, 84 percent of women in these communities experience some
form of violence in their lifetime.
The rural nature of most Native American communities, increased
levels of poverty and addiction, and other circumstances pose unique
challenges. Because of outdated databases and lack of coordination
between law enforcement agencies, there is no reliable way of knowing
how many indigenous women actually do go missing each year.
Savanna's Act addresses this disturbing increase in missing and
murdered Native American women by creating new guidelines for
investigation of these cases and by incentivizing the implementation of
these new guidelines.
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 227, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from
California (Mrs. Torres).
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in honor
of Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind and the Native American women missing
and murdered with no justice in sight.
Savanna was just 22, a member of the Spirit Lake Tribe. She was 8
months pregnant and expecting her baby any day when she was murdered in
August of 2017. A neighbor in her apartment building lured her next
door and attacked her. When her body was found, the coroner could not
determine if the cause of death was the loss of blood from the vicious
wounds on her body or strangulation from the rope around her neck.
Instead of getting to hold her brand-new baby in her arms and
imagining a bright future for herself and her little one, Savanna's
future was cut short.
Savanna's death shines a light on a horrific reality in this country
where Native American women face a murder rate 10 times higher than the
national average.
The statistics should shock everyone listening to this debate.
Eighty-four percent of Native women experience some form of violence in
their lifetime--84 percent. Think of your 50 closest friends and family
members, and now imagine 42 out of those 50 experiencing some type of
violence.
We cannot stand silent. We stand together, heartbroken, disgusting,
and horrified, but we cannot stand back and do nothing.
I introduced the House version of Savanna's Act to address the
disturbing rates of missing and murdered Native American women, and I
was very honored to have the opportunity to work with my good friend,
Ms. Haaland, across the aisle with Mr. Newhouse, and with Senator
Murkowski and Senator Cortez Masto on the Senate version. We came
together as Democrats and Republicans. We met many, many, many times to
ensure that this was a bill that all of our colleagues could stand for
and support and right a wrong for Native American women.
To date, there is no reliable way of knowing how many Native women go
missing each year because the databases that hold statistics of these
cases are outdated. A lack of coordination between law enforcement
agencies only adds to the confusion, and, as a result, murderers get
away with killing Native American women.
This bill will finally ensure the Department of Justice, State and
local law enforcement agencies, and our communities can work together
to address this violence.
Because of this bill, the Department of Justice will develop
regionally appropriate guidelines for response to cases of missing and
murdered Native Americans, and the DOJ will provide training and
technical assistance to Tribes and law enforcement agencies for
implementation of the developed guidelines.
In addition, this bill will authorize grants to ensure that all
members of
[[Page H4576]]
our community are effectively working together to stop the kidnapping
and murdering of Native women.
Native women have endured horrific rates of assault, rape, and murder
for far too long, and I hope this bill brings some closure to Savanna's
family and the countless family members in Native communities who live
with the pain of a lost loved one every day.
Let me be clear: It is their unwavering advocacy that made this day a
reality, and an untold number of lives will be saved as a result.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from
Washington (Mr. Newhouse).
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, this is a monumental day. I am proud to
rise alongside my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to speak out in
support of our legislation, which aims to address a crisis afflicting
our Nation: that of missing and murdered indigenous women.
I hail from the State of Washington, and I am very familiar with how
Native American Tribes are deeply integrated into the culture of the
Pacific Northwest, as well as our whole country.
I was raised just across the river from the Yakama Nation reservation
in central Washington, but I have got to say, I, like many others, was
not aware of the disproportionate murder rate indigenous women suffer,
10 times the national average.
At the end of 2018, this crisis and the need for a solution was
brought to me by the Tribal communities that I represent, and I was
made aware of just how devastating the shortfalls of our justice system
are for Native American and Alaska Native women and girls.
While the statistics we have are absolutely staggering--and you have
heard them--the fact of the matter is we don't even know the full
extent of the crisis.
In my home State of Washington, Native Americans make up about 2
percent of the State's population, but a recent report by the
Washington State Patrol shows that indigenous women account for 7
percent of the State's reported missing women. The families of dozens
of women still await answers as cases of missing or murdered indigenous
women remain open or turn cold.
Yet this crisis has gone on for decades, with little to no action by
the Federal Government. Complicated law enforcement jurisdictions have
caused many problems throughout these investigations, and far too many
Tribal law enforcement agencies lack the resources or access to
critical databases to help solve these cases, which is why, when
Savanna's Act failed to receive a vote on the House floor in the 115th
Congress, I was determined to bring forward solutions in order to get
this bill signed into law.
I was very proud to work with Representatives Torres and Haaland and
others, in collaboration with Tribes, the Department of Justice, and
many others, to improve upon that legislation. The product is a broadly
bipartisan bill that has passed unanimously in both the House Judiciary
Committee as well as the United States Senate.
We worked to create legislation that will bring focus to this crisis
and improve the coordination between Federal, State, local, and Tribal
law enforcement agencies.
This legislation aims to provide a sense of hope to the loved ones of
these women by developing guidelines and best practices for Tribes and
law enforcement agencies across the country, by enhancing reporting and
recordkeeping of crimes against indigenous women, and by improving
communication between law enforcement and the families of these
victims.
This bill and this effort to bring awareness to the missing and
murdered Native women across the country will go a long way to finally
delivering justice to our communities.
Tribes across the country, including those that I represent, have
thrown their support behind this legislation. In fact, last year, I
walked alongside the then-chairman of the Yakama Tribe, as well as
Councilwoman Lottie Sam, through the Halls of Congress, visiting
Chairman Grijalva, Subcommittee Chairman Gallego, as well as
Subcommittee Chairwoman Bass. These Yakama Nation officials traveled
across the country, Mr. Speaker, more than 2,500 miles, to advocate for
the passage of Savanna's Act and other legislation to address this
crisis.
The bill is named, as you have heard the story, in honor of Savanna
LaFontaine-Greywind, who was a 22-year-old member of the Spirit Lake
Tribe, pregnant with her first child, who was murdered in August of
2017.
Since the introduction of Savanna's Act in the House, the remains of
a Yakama Nation woman, Rosenda Strong, were found on the reservation.
Her horrific murder, today, remains unsolved.
Thankfully, justice was served upon Savanna's murderers. We owe the
same justice to Rosenda and all of the missing and murdered indigenous
women across this country.
The passage of this bill today will demonstrate a long-awaited and
necessary change. As I mentioned, this crisis has been going on for
decades. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have promised action
and failed to deliver.
{time}  1400
I have been asked: What is different now? Why do you think progress
can be made?
And I can honestly tell you, the main difference I have seen is that
our Native communities are leading the charge. They have had enough,
and they no longer will suffer in silence.
Throughout central Washington and across the country, the families of
loved ones of thousands of missing or murdered indigenous women are
awaiting justice.
It is because of their voices and their strong advocacy that I am
here today, urging my colleagues throughout this legislative body to
support passage of Savanna's Act. And, finally, Mr. Speaker, we can
send this legislation to President Trump's desk to be signed into law.
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Torres, Mr. Newhouse, and my colleagues in
the Senate, Senator Cramer and Senator Hoeven. This is not the first
time in my short time in Congress that I have been on the floor talking
about this bill, and I think it is also important to remember people
who came before us. Senator Heitkamp was a champion of this in the last
Congress. And through this process we have gotten a more targeted and
workable solution.
This bill allows U.S. Attorneys in Indian Country more autonomy and
authority that is important to law enforcement, and that is
particularly important in missing cases. And I think it is also
important to recognize that these don't always happen in rural areas or
actually on the reservation.
Savanna Greywind, while a member of the Spirit Lake Tribe, was in
Fargo, North Dakota, the largest city in my State when this incident
occurred.
So this is a good bill, it has been a long time coming, and I really
appreciate everybody's hard work. With that, I recommend we pass it,
and I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, Savanna's Act is an important measure to ensure the
safety of Native American women and men in communities across the
United States, for all of the reasons discussed here today.
We are so grateful to Representative Torres, Representative Newhouse,
Representative Armstrong, and Representative Haaland, for moving this
legislation forward.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this
bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, S. 227.
The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
