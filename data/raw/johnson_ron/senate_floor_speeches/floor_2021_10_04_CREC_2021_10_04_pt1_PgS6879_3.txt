PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of
America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation
under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.
Ms. HIRONO. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so
ordered.
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me say at the outset that I will
yield the floor if either leader comes. I know they are busy in their
offices, and I would be prepared to give them whatever opportunity they
need.
