WASHINGTON
– Today, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) spoke on the Senate floor to discuss his
Shutdown Fairness Act
, which ensures that all federal employees reporting to work during a shutdown receive pay and allowances on a regular basis during a lapse in appropriations. He called for renewed bipartisan cooperation to demonstrate that the Senate can work as intended.
“I come from the private sector. You don't get a whole lot accomplished arguing all the time. It's all about finding areas of agreement. I’ve got a product, you want to buy it, and we’ll haggle over the price,”
Sen. Johnson began.
“There are more than 2 million federal employees who are now being forced to work because they're termed excepted — but that means they're essential. They're protecting our nation. They're protecting our safety and security. They're writing Social Security checks. To see that they get their paycheck, so they don't have to work DoorDash, and so they don't have to go to food banks, so they're not under that stress,”
Sen. Johnson said.
“I am asking in good faith. Let's figure out how to get that done.”
“Wouldn’t it be wonderful to actually see this process work in the Senate? […] Let’s sit down in good faith, let’s hammer out the amendments, and let’s get this thing passed next week,”
Sen. Johnson concluded.
