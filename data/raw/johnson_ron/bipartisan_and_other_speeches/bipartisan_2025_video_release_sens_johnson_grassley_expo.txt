WASHINGTON
– Yesterday, Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) for a press conference regarding the release of 197
subpoenas
issued by Special Counsel Jack Smith as part of a case against President Trump. The investigation, launched by Joe Biden’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and codenamed “Arctic Frost,” sought testimony, communications, and records related to at least 430 Republican individuals and entities. The subpoenas were obtained by Chairman Grassley through legally protected whistleblower disclosures.
“My first point is we need more whistleblowers. We need people, men and women, inside these agencies who have integrity, who want to see the integrity and credibility of the Department of Justice, of the FBI, restored, come forward. Because right now, I think Kash Patel and Pam Bondi are overwhelmed by all the messes they're trying to clean up,”
Sen. Johnson stated.
“People need to understand how politicized the Biden administration turned all these agencies. And again, the best way to describe President Biden's attitude were his exact quotes, how he thought basically half of America were domestic terrorists. In September 2022, in front of Independence Hall, he said, ‘Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundation of our republic.’ A year later, in New York City, ‘Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy.’ Now nothing could be further from the truth,”
Sen. Johnson continued.
“The American people need to understand exactly what happened. And again, I'm calling on members of the Judiciary Committee to help Senator Grassley and myself get to the bottom of this so we can expose this. So this doesn't happen again in America,”
Sen. Johnson concluded.
