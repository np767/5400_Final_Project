WASHINGTON
– Yesterday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, held a hearing entitled “Assessing the Damage Done by Obamacare.” The Subcommittee heard from four witnesses who discussed Obamacare’s failures to lower costs and meet coverage goals.
The first witness,
Joel White
, explained how Obamacare’s expansion of the third-party payer system has fueled insurer consolidation, reduced competition, and driven up costs.
The second witness,
Tarren Bragdon
, described the damage done to Medicaid and to those whom Medicaid was originally designed to help.
The third witness,
Brian Blase, PhD
, explained how Obamacare’s complex exchanges dismantled the individual market and drove premiums and deductibles sharply higher.
The minority witness,
Shana Verstegen
– a fellow Wisconsinite – is a victim of Obamacare’s soaring premiums and perverse incentives causing employers to drop coverage and force their employees on to the unaffordable exchanges.
