WASHINGTON
– Today, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) introduced a substitute amendment to his
Shutdown Fairness Act
and is seeking unanimous consent from his Senate colleagues to pay all federal employees and servicemembers, including furloughed workers, during a government shutdown.
“Right now, I'd be willing to add furloughed workers because we're going to pay them anyway […] Would you take my bill, add furloughed workers, say it’s a done deal? Is that something you’d accept here today?”
Sen. Johnson
said
to Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) during his floor speech on October 23, 2025.
Sen. Johnson was joined by U.S. Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.).
