WASHINGTON
– Today, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) participated in a field hearing in Pacific Palisades, California held by the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging entitled, “
Forgotten After the Flames: Stories from the Palisades Fire
.” U.S. Senator Rick Scott (R-Fla.) chaired the hearing.
The hearing is part of the senators’
ongoing efforts
to examine the deadly Palisades wildfire in Los Angeles that resulted in billions of dollars in property damage and the tragic loss of life. The senators heard from survivors, local leaders, and advocates who described the challenges that the aging community faced in preparing for, evacuating from, and recovering after the deadly fire — and how they continue to access resources nearly a year later.
The senators examined government failures in preparedness and response and emphasized the urgent need for accountability and reforms to ensure that seniors and other vulnerable populations are not overlooked in future disaster recovery efforts.
