posts
calling for the deaths of several Democratic senators and House members, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand released the following statement:
“We have reached an extremely perilous moment in our history. The president of the United States calling for the death of his political opponents is disgusting, outrageous, and downright dangerous. These members of Congress have all served their country honorably and were simply stating the law as it stands, and President Trump is putting their lives in danger for opposing his political agenda. I call on all of my Republican colleagues to condemn President Trump’s disgraceful rhetoric immediately.”
