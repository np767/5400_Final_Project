KOREAN AMERICAN DAY
(Ms. MENG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Korean American Day,
a day that commemorates the first Korean immigrants to arrive in the
United States on January 13, 1903. On that day, the S.S. Gaelic brought
56 men, 21 women, and 25 children across the Pacific Ocean from Korea
to America in search of a better future.
On Korean American Day, our Nation celebrates a community that has
made tremendous contributions to this country. Since 1903, the Korean
American population has grown to almost 2 million and has become
intricately woven in the fabric of our country.
Korean Americans have made contributions in all aspects of American
life. They are our servicemembers, our doctors, businessmen, teachers,
and community leaders. They are our neighbors and, most importantly,
our friends.
For centuries, Korean immigrants and their descendants have helped
build America's prosperity. Their culture enriches our lives in so many
ways as they uphold the important values of community, hard work, and
family that make America strong.
I am proud to be a part of New York State, which has the second
largest Korean American population in the U.S. I am honored to join my
colleagues and friends in celebrating all that the Korean Americans
have done for our great Nation.
