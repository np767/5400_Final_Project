RECOGNIZING LYNNEL RUCKERT
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute.)
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, when building a strong team, you need a
strong leader. Lynnel Ruckert has been that strong leader.
As my chief of staff, Lynnel has also been an ally and a friend since
the very first day I arrived in Congress. Whether it has been the whip
team, the Republican Study Committee, or Louisiana's First
Congressional District, under her guidance, strong leadership, and
relentless drive, Lynnel played a crucial role in delivering countless
conservative victories for both our country and Louisiana.
I wouldn't be where I am today without Lynnel Ruckert. I am and will
forever be grateful for Lynnel's dedication and unwavering commitment
to our Team Scalise family.
Every day, she made the extra effort to bring a little Louisiana to
Washington. We call it lagniappe. There was not a day that went by
where she didn't wear a fleur-de-lis or some other symbol of our great
State of Louisiana that we both love.
Lynnel, you will be truly missed. I wish you, Kyle, and the whole
Ruckert family all the best as you enter this new, exciting chapter in
your life back home in Louisiana.
