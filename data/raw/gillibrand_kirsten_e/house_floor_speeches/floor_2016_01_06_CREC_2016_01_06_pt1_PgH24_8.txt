GUN SAFETY
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the President of the United
States announced another series of actions that his administration is
taking to curb our Nation's gun violence epidemic, for they are
important steps, and I commend the President and Vice President for
their continued focus on this ongoing crisis. As the President said
yesterday, Congress still needs to act.
In my 15 years as a Member of the House, Congress time and again has
[[Page H25]]
failed to answer the cries of Americans who have lost their loved ones,
particularly our children, to the scourge of gun violence.
Congress has failed to respond to the pleas of Americans who have
been disabled by stray bullets. Congress has failed to acknowledge the
vast majority of Americans--Republicans and Democrats, gun owners and
non gun owners--who believe that every gun purchased should be
accompanied by a background check. With each failure, we are closer to
a day when tragedies like those of San Bernardino and Sandy Hook will
become what they never should be: commonplace.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to find the courage to take action.
It is long past overdue.
