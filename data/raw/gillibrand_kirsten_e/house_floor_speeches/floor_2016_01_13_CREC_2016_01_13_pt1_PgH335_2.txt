CONGRATULATIONS TO THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS
(Mr. ELLISON asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute.)
Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I take the floor today to congratulate the
fans of the Seattle Seahawks.
You see, I talked with my good friend Congresswoman Suzan DelBene and
told her that the Minnesota Vikings were for sure going to beat the
Seahawks.

She said: Well, if you really believe that, why don't you agree to
come down to the House floor if they don't, and I will come down to the
House floor if they do.
For three quarters, I was right, Mr. Speaker. The Vikings shut the
Seahawks out completely. But in the fourth quarter, through luck--and
this is the real skill of the Seahawks, by the way--the center throws
one over the head of the quarterback.
The quarterback runs 20 yards back. It looks like he is just going to
fall on it, but he picks it up, finds an open man, hits him, and then
the guy almost scores, and then, on the next play, they do.
Then, after that, the leading rusher in the NFL, A.P.--Adrian
Peterson--drops a pass and fumbles it and then they get the ball and
kick a field goal. We are now 9-10.
Even still, the Vikings were about to win, Mr. Speaker, but the
lucky, lucky Seahawks saw our excellent field goal kicker miss one,
although he has been making them all year long.
So I am here to congratulate the Seahawks as the luckiest team in the
NFL.
