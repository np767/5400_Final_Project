PLANNED PARENTHOOD
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, this House unfortunately passed a
bill to basically repeal the Affordable Care Act and do away with
funding for Planned Parenthood. I know the President will veto that
bill, and I want to thank him in advance.
In Tennessee, 236,000 people signed up for the Affordable Care Act.
That is 236,000 people who, if the bill becomes law, will not have
health care or will have more expensive health care.
Nationally, 11 million people signed up. Those people will not have
it or will have more expensive health care.
If you stop Planned Parenthood, you stop poor people, many of whom
are in my district, from getting preventive health care: mammograms,
HIV testing, and planned birth control programs.
This was a bad bill against the people of our country, taking away
health care from people who need it, otherwise can't afford it, and
otherwise wouldn't get it.
Thank you, Mr. President.
