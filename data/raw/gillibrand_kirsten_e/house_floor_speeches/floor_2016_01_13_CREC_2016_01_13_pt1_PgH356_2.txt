VACATING VOTE ON H.R. 3662, IRAN TERROR FINANCE TRANSPARENCY ACT
Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the
proceedings by which the bill (H.R. 3662) to enhance congressional
oversight over the administration of sanctions against certain
terrorism financiers, and for other purposes, was passed and the motion
to reconsider was laid on the table be vacated and that further
proceedings on the question of passage of H.R. 3662 may be postponed
through the legislative day of January 26, 2016, as though under clause
8 of rule XX.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the
gentleman from California?
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object--and I do not
intend to object--I want to thank the majority leader. I personally, as
a former majority leader, appreciate the policy enunciated by the
Speaker in turn to accommodate Members' schedules so that we vote on
time. But this was an extraordinarily important vote. Large numbers of
Members of both sides missed it, and I very much appreciate the
majority leader's action and the Speaker's agreement to it to
accommodate our Members so that, on this important bill, they will be
able to vote on the 26th.
Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of objection is withdrawn.
Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Proceedings whereby the motion to reconsider
was laid on the table and by which the House passed H.R. 3662 are
vacated, and further proceedings on the questions of passage of H.R.
3662 are postponed pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the order of the
House of today.
