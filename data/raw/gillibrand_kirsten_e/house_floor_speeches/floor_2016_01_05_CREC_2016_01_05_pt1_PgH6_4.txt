MAKING AMERICA SAFER
(Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to be a
Member of this House and to be elected in a wonderful, beautiful
economy in the greatest Nation on the Earth.
The year 2015 has expired. We have just begun this session in 2016.
But the question, ladies and gentlemen, is: What are we going to do to
serve the public? What are the things that we are going to focus on to
make sure that our constituents are safer so that we continue to
provide a democracy that is an example for other countries?
We have heard just in the first few minutes of these speeches about
how we need to make America safer. Well, one way that we can do that is
to do our job so that the executive of our country doesn't have to try
to do whatever he can to extend his responsibilities because we are not
doing enough.
There are too many moments of silence, ladies and gentlemen, where 9,
10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 Americans are killed through senseless violence,
and we have done almost nothing about it as a Congress.
