WASP ARLINGTON INURNMENT RESTORATION ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. Denham) for 5 minutes.
Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the contributions the
WASPs have made to our great country. These are the Women Airforce
Service Pilots, and they represent an elite group of female pilots.
They flew combat missions during World War II. These women displayed
courage, valor, and a willingness to serve, and they made invaluable
contributions to our Nation's efforts to battle on the world stage.
There were fewer than 1,100 WASPs, and 38 of them died during their
service. But because the unit was created in 1942, the WASP group was
never granted full military status.
In 1977, Congress retroactively granted Active-Duty status to these
brave pilots to ensure that all VA policies, laws, and services would
apply to them; yet, the Army recently denied the request of WASPs who
were seeking a place in Arlington National Cemetery. They say they are
running out of space.
This decision flies in the face of our Nation's efforts to recognize,
reward, and treat honorably the contributions of all of our veterans.
These women deserve the same honor that is bestowed upon hundreds of
thousands of their fellow servicemembers.
So I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring and supporting the
bill.

I say this to the VA: Find the space.
