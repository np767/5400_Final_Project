FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT OF 2015
The Committee resumed its sitting.
Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Nadler
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10
printed in House Report 114-389.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as follows:
Beginning on page 2, strike line 5 and all that follows
through line 2 on page 3, and insert the following:
``(8) A trust described in paragraph (2) shall file with
the bankruptcy court, not later than 60 days after the end of
every quarter, a report that shall be made available on the
court's public docket and with respect to each such reporting
period contains an aggregate list of demands received and an
aggregate list of payments made.''.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 581, the gentleman
from New York (Mr. Nadler) and a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Chair, my amendment would address the bill's
serious violation of the privacy of asbestos victims. Instead of
requiring asbestos trusts to disclose detailed personal information
about asbestos victims, as the bill would do, my amendment would
require aggregate reporting of the demands received and payments made
by those trusts. This would ensure transparency of the trusts without
jeopardizing the privacy of the victims.
Let's remember why these asbestos trusts are established in the first
place. Corporations that knowingly produced a toxic substance that
killed or seriously injured unsuspecting American consumers and workers
have since been held accountable for their practices through
litigation. Asbestos companies that enter bankruptcy have the option of
establishing a trust to satisfy the obligations to their victims while
shielding themselves from future claims when they emerge from
bankruptcy.
As if contracting a painful and life-threatening disease like lung
cancer or mesothelioma from exposure to asbestos is not bad enough,
this bill would further victimize claimants by putting their personal
information on the Internet, available to anyone who may seek to take
advantage of them. The bill would require each asbestos trust to list
the payment demands it has received, the amounts demanded, as well as
the names and exposure histories of each claimant, along with the basis
for any payment from the trust of such claimant. This information would
be posted on the public docket of the court that established the trust,
a docket that is easily accessible on the Internet through paying a
nominal fee.
Now, it is true that the reports required under this bill would not
include any ``confidential medical record''--a term that is undefined--
or a claimant's full Social Security number, but with just the
information that the bill requires to be provided, one can still learn
a tremendous amount of sensitive health information about a victim.
Releasing such information is an invitation to scam artists, to
identity thieves, as well as to data brokers who may use the
information collected to deny employment or credit or insurance to the
victims.
To prevent this totally unnecessary and wrong invasion of privacy, my
amendment would say, okay, we will release aggregate data from the
trust sufficient to ensure transparency and to combat the imagined
fraud claimed by supporters of the bill, but we won't expose the
personal information of asbestos victims and make them vulnerable to
further victimization.
Rather than standing with the corporations supporting this
legislation, which spent decades poisoning Americans with asbestos, I
urge my colleagues to stand with Susan Vento, a fierce opponent of this
bill and the widow of our former colleague Bruce Vento, who lost his
life due to asbestos exposure.
Stand with the many organizations opposing this bill that do not wish
to see asbestos victims' personal information compromised. Stand with
the victims who have suffered enough.
If you believe there is fraud, fine. The amendment would say present
the aggregate information which would prevent or reveal the fraud, but
don't further victimize the victims by putting their personal
information on the Internet so that they can be further victimized in
their privacy, and in reality they can be victimized by scam artists or
employers or others.
I urge adoption of the Nadler amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the
gentleman's amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, the FACT Act requires increased
transparency to combat fraud committed against the asbestos trusts.
This amendment strikes the requirement that the asbestos trusts publish
the very data that would be necessary to detect the fraud between the
trusts and State court tort proceedings.
In its place, the amendment calls for quarterly reports under the
bill to publish only aggregate lists of demands received and aggregate
lists of payments made by the trusts. Simple aggregation of information
is not enough to allow defendants and State court parties and sister
asbestos trusts to make meaningful inquiry into whether or not they are
being defrauded.
The amendment also removes the requirement that the asbestos trusts
respond to information requests from parties subject to asbestos-
related suits and imposes the cost of such requests on the inquiring
parties. The cost-shifting element of this provision is significant. In
fact, a GAO report found that one asbestos trust had to pay over $1
million to respond to a discovery request. Rather than have asbestos
trust money used to comply with discovery requests, they should be
preserved for the payment to the victims of asbestos-related illnesses.
This amendment not only guts the transparency requirements and
elements of the bill, it also removes meaningful cost-saving measures.
In fact, the bill is carefully crafted to protect folks' privacy. Here
is what happens: The legislation ensures that claimants' confidential
medical records and full Social Security numbers will not be made
public.
Trust reports are also subject to the Bankruptcy Code's existing
privacy protections. Section 107 of the code, for example, allows
courts to protect any information that would present an undue risk of
identity theft or injure a claimant if disclosed. Rule 9037 of the
Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Privacy Protection for Filings
Made with the Court, would also apply to these public reports. The rule
would allow the courts to require redactions of personal and private
information. Finally, rule 9037 will allow the courts to limit or
prohibit electronic access to the trust reports.
Courts throughout the country already use these rules to protect the
personal information of individuals who file claims during asbestos
bankruptcies. For example, the court, in overseeing a Garlock
bankruptcy, redacted trust claims information that was introduced into
a hearing record and later released to the public. Other courts have
required anyone reviewing bankruptcy claims to agree to strict
protective ordinances.
Witnesses at the House Committee on the Judiciary on the FACT Act
have explained that the bill does not threaten asbestos victims'
privacy and that asbestos claimants routinely disclose more information
than the trust would be required to report in the course of tort
litigation and bankruptcy proceedings.
[[Page H201]]
For these and other reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the
Nadler amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Chair, we should realize that the Bankruptcy Code
sections cited by the distinguished gentleman from Texas are
permissive, not mandatory. Bankruptcy Code section 107(c), for example,
permits, but does not require, the bankruptcy court to issue an order
prohibiting the disclosure of certain information pertaining to an
individual's for cause if the court finds that disclosure of such
information would create undue risk of identity theft or other unlawful
injury to the individual or the individual's property.
In other words, the victim here, who has been victimized by the
people who produced the asbestos, would now have to go into court and
request the protective order. The burden would be on the victim.
Why are we putting the burden on the victim instead of on the
tortfeasor? The bill would do that. The Bankruptcy Code's section 107
so-called privacy protection is not automatic. As a result, the
asbestos victim would have to retain counsel and go to court to prove
cause to obtain relief. Again, you are shifting the burden further to
the victim from the tortfeasor. That is not a very good idea, and there
is no great necessity for it.
If the court finds or if a trust believes that it is being defrauded,
it can request the court to get this information. It can ask for
discovery. Yes, discovery is expensive, but you want to shift the
expense to the victim. That is highly unfair.
This bill shifts tremendous burden to the victim. If he doesn't pick
up that burden and go in for protective orders, it puts personal
information that can be used to further victimize him open to anyone
who wants to get it on the Internet.
My amendment would say no, to publish aggregate data that will help
prevent fraud--I am not sure that there is much fraud--but publish
aggregate data that would help prevent fraud; and if you have a reason,
then you can go and ask the court for more, instead of the other way
around.
The question is: Should the burden be on the tortfeasor or on the
victim? I side with the victim.
I urge the adoption of this amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, I think we are going down a rabbit trail
here. I agree with Mr. Nadler. This bill is designed to protect
victims. It is not intended to increase the burdens or the cost on the
victim. It does require the trusts to publish the name and the basis of
the claim of folks who claim trust so that they are not double-dipped
and pay more than one claim for the same person. That is what we are
trying to do here.
As we start to get into the additional information, that is further
down the road. That is not part of the disclosure requirements of the
FACT Act. But once the litigation proceeds and we have determined that
somebody has filed a claim and they are in another court, the further
information requested would normally be part of that proceeding and
then would fall under the Bankruptcy Code rules.
The disclosures of the FACT Act requirements from the asbestos trust
are very limited: name and the nature of the claim and where they were
exposed. That is less information than you have to release when you
file any sort of tort case in a State court. It is basically what we
consider to be the bare minimum in order to allow defendants to sniff
out the possibility of double-dipping and fraudulent claims.
Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the
gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).
The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes
appeared to have it.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York
will be postponed.
Announcement by the Acting Chair
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings
will now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 114-389 on
which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:

electronic vote after the first vote in this series.
Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Cohen
The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a

Announcement by the Acting Chair
The Acting CHAIR (during the vote). There is 1 minute remaining.
{time}  1232
So the amendment was rejected.
The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a
substitute.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.
Hultgren) having assumed the chair, Ms. Foxx, Acting Chair of the
Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that
that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1927) to
amend title 28, United States Code, to improve fairness in class action
litigation, and, pursuant to House Resolution 581, she reported the
bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of
the Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is
ordered.
The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute.
The amendment was agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third
reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was
read the third time.
Motion to Recommit
Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?
Ms. McCOLLUM. Very much so, I am opposed.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to
recommit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Ms. McCollum moves to recommit the bill (H.R. 1927) to the
Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to report the
bill back to the House forthwith with the following
amendment:
At the end of section 3 of the bill, add the following:
(c) Protecting the Privacy of Children Injured by Asbestos
in a School.--Paragraph (8) of section 524(g) of title 11 of
the United States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall not
apply with respect to a claimant whose claim is filed by or
on behalf of an individual exposed to asbestos as a child in
a school environment.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,
which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,
the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.
Mr. Speaker, asbestos is a known carcinogen. Asbestos wreaks havoc on
the health and livelihoods of the people exposed to it, killing
approximately 10,000 Americans each year.
This deadly poison can cause lung cancer and mesothelioma, an
aggressive cancer that an estimated 3,000 Americans are diagnosed with
each year.
Once detected, mesothelioma victims may only survive 8 to 14 months.
This was true for my predecessor, the late Congressman Bruce Vento.
Bruce proudly served Minnesota's Fourth District for more than 20 years
in this House, and many of you served with him in this Chamber.
Bruce died from mesothelioma in 2000, only months--only months--after
he was diagnosed. I lost a friend and a mentor. His family lost a
husband, a father, a son, and a brother. Since then, I have worked with
mesothelioma patients and their families to fight this awful disease,
and to hold those responsible for asbestos exposure accountable.
I can tell you, this legislation does not support the victims of
asbestos. Asbestos trusts would be forced--forced--to release the
private information of
[[Page H208]]
patients and their families on a public Web site. Listing a patient's
name, their address, health and financial information, and the last
four digits of their Social Security number exposes these patients to
identity theft.
H.R. 1927 would also delay any compensation victims could receive
with new, cumbersome, and unnecessary procedural hurdles, meaning many
victims will not live long enough to get the justice they deserve or
know that their families will not be burdened with medical costs.
This legislation is unacceptable for those seeking justice from
asbestos exposure. It is especially outrageous when we know this
legislation does not provide basic protection for children.
This amendment would protect children. This amendment will ensure
that children exposed to asbestos will not have their personal
information disclosed--children exposed to asbestos from the walls, the
ceilings, and the floors of their classrooms, or even the possible
exposure from crayons that they used that were manufactured in China.
Our children deserve protection. Their parents should have the peace
of mind that their child's privacy is secure.
As a mother, I cannot imagine the anguish of worrying about my
child's health as they suffer from asbestos exposure, and then add the
burden of worrying that my child's private information was exposed on a
Web site.
Without this amendment to the current bill, you will be voting to
deliver sensitive information about children to criminals who could
exploit them. Let me be clear: This information will be available to
identity thieves and to sexual predators.
Congressman Vento was a dedicated public servant and an asbestos
victim. I know Bruce would be horrified that this House would allow a
child's personal information to be exposed in this incredibly
irresponsible manner, and we should stop it from happening. We can stop
it from happening.
Congress has a responsibility to find real solutions to help and
support victims, especially children of asbestos exposure and their
families. This bill falls far short of it.
The least we can do here today is to protect the privacy of innocent
children who have already suffered enough. I urge my colleagues to pass
this amendment and to protect the privacy of vulnerable children.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to
recommit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am stunned by how many people
apparently have not read this 3-page bill. Nowhere in the bill does it
say we are going to release addresses. Nowhere does it say we are going
to release medical records. It is simply the name, the basis of the
claim, and exposure.
Furthermore, this is designed to protect victims, especially
children. There needs to be money in these trusts for future claims. We
want to help the children, not the plaintiffs' attorneys.
This amendment is wholly unnecessary. If you look at rule 9037 of the
Bankruptcy Code, by default, unless the court orders otherwise,
information about a minor is restricted to only releasing, in any case,
the last 4 digits of the Social Security number, the year of the
individual's birth, the minor's initials, not the minor's name, and the
last four digits of the financial account number.
This motion to recommit is just a waste of time and it is
unnecessary. It is already covered by the Bankruptcy Code.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is
ordered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
Recorded Vote
Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on
the question of passage.
This is a 5-minute vote.
The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 173,
noes 227, not voting 33, as follows:

Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
The SPEAKER pro tempore (during the vote). There are 2 minutes
remaining.
{time}  1247
Mr. HURT of Virginia changed his vote from ``aye'' to ``no.''
So the motion to recommit was rejected.
The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
Stated for:
Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, on rollcall vote 32 (On Motion to
Recommit with Instructions related to H.R. 1927), had I been present, I
would have voted ``yea.''
(By unanimous consent, Ms. McSally was allowed to speak out of
order.)
Moment of Silence Commemorating Fifth Anniversary of Shooting in
Tucson, Arizona
Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues from
Arizona and around the country to commemorate the fifth anniversary of
the shooting that took place on January 8, 2011, in Tucson, Arizona.
On that sunny, chilly Saturday morning, six people were killed and 13
were wounded at a Congress on Your Corner event, hosted by
Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. The Congresswoman was among the
injured, along with the member of her staff who would succeed her,
Congressman Ron Barber.
For many, the pain of that day will always be with us, but Tucson has
not languished in grief. As we remember the victims, we also remember
how our community rose up with courage and unity to support those
grieving and to honor their loved ones.
Signs of that courage are all around us. The January 8th Memorial
Foundation is working to build a permanent tribute to the victims as
well as to our community's response. Just feet below us in this
building is the Gabriel Zimmerman Meeting Room, a lasting tribute to
the congressional staffer who died while serving the men and women of
southern Arizona.
Today and this weekend people around southern Arizona will be coming
together to celebrate the lives of our friends and loved ones who were
taken too soon and to celebrate the difference they made and continue
to make. There are hikes, bike rides, runs, storytelling, discussions,
gatherings, and much more.
While we know some wounds may never fully heal, by carrying on the
legacy of those who died, we ensure their memories are never forgotten:
Christina-Taylor Green, Dorothy Morris, Judge John Roll, Phyllis
Schneck, Dorwan Stoddard, and Gabe Zimmerman.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House observe a moment of silence in
remembrance of those we lost.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, 5-minute voting will
continue.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.
The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Recorded Vote
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5-minute vote.
The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 211,
noes 188, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 33, as follows:
