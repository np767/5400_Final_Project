PRO-LIFE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) for 5 minutes.
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, the Declaration of Independence contains
a passage that every student in America learns at an early age. It
explains that each of us are endowed by our Creator with certain
inalienable rights, chief among them the right to life. This highlights
and reminds us just how much our Founders valued the right to life.
As an elected Representative, the words in our Declaration that
follow are equally compelling: To secure these rights, governments are
instituted among men. How often we forget that government exists first
and foremost to secure the right to life.
Now, this is an immense responsibility, one that I take very
seriously, because one of the highest honors I have in representing the
Fourth Congressional District of Texas is defending the most vulnerable
among us, our unborn children. I am proud to have a voting record that
reflects my unwavering commitment to protecting unborn life and ending
taxpayer funding of abortion.
I will also be the first to tell you that legislators represent only
one piece of the puzzle in the ongoing and vital effort to promote a
culture of life. There are literally thousands of unsung pro-life
heroes in the Fourth Congressional District of Texas, whose effort to
promote a culture of life are not about gaining recognition or
notoriety, but are simply rooted in an abiding sense of protecting the
inalienable right to life, which our Founding Fathers spoke of.
I would like to take this opportunity to recognize a few of these
pro-life heroes in my district, people like Melanie Grammar and Deborah
Butts with the Texas Federation of Republican Women; Michelle Smith and
Ann Hettinger in Rockwall, Texas; Chip Adami at the True Options
Pregnancy Center in Sherman; Mason Randall and Robin Stevenson at Lake
Pointe Church Adoption Ministry; Kristie Wright at the First Choice
Pregnancy Resource Center in Texarkana; Threesa Sadler and Tim
Stainback at the Raffa Center in Greenville; Joanne Vuckovic at the
Rockwall Pregnancy Resource Center; and the great folks at both the
Paris and Fannin Pregnancy Care Centers.
The dedication of individuals like these and thousands of others
across the Fourth Congressional District of Texas is appreciated, it is
necessary, and it certainly does not go unnoticed. Thank you all for
your commitment to protecting the incredibly important cause of life.
