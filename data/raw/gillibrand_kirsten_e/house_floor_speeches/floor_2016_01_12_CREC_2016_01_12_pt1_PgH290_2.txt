PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FINAL STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, one recalls the state of the Union that
President Obama inherited upon taking office: overwhelming problems
occasioned by the near collapse of the economy, 700,000 jobs lost
before he was even in office half a month. It would take many months
more to arrest the slide. There were fierce battles, arguments about
whether we should spend money to try to help people and industries.
His work was complicated by the announcement early on by the
Republican leader in the Senate that his number one goal was not to fix
the economy or deal with health care or the environment or national
security; it was to prevent President Obama from being reelected to a
second term.
Time has shown that the money that was spent was critical, and most
independent experts agree that we should have invested more heavily in
things like rebuilding and renewing America. Even so, our performance
has been better than any of the other developed economies.
Those results were achieved with divisions and arguments that
continue to be played out today on the national political stage as
there are people seeking the Presidency later this year. But my hope is
that, as the President addresses this Chamber tonight, there might be
an opportunity to move past some of the divisions and controversy.
My hope is, as the President looks up in the gallery and sees the
First Lady, that he might pause and acknowledge her important work in
health and nutrition; that he might spend just 3 minutes on a topic
that can bring people together; that he would admit that we as a
government still pay too much to the wrong people to grow the wrong
crops in the wrong places, that we would be far better off if we
weren't subsidizing people to grow food that actually makes Americans
sick.
I would hope that he would propose that the Federal Government help
more farmers and ranchers with research and market access at home and
abroad. Let's pay those farmers and ranchers to protect water quality
and water quantity.
I would hope that he would propose that we subsidize more healthy
food in our schools and for senior citizens and low-income people.
I would hope that he would acknowledge the revolution that is taking
place in food and agricultural thought and policy in this country, as
documented in the recent PBS special, ``In Defense of Food,'' with
Michael Pollan.
There is an exciting national movement promoting value-added
agriculture, healthy food, animal welfare, and environmental protection
that will strengthen rural and small town America and provide more
satisfaction for the men and women who work in agriculture.
It would only take 3 minutes, but it would be an important milestone
for this revolution of food and farm policy that cannot happen soon
enough.
