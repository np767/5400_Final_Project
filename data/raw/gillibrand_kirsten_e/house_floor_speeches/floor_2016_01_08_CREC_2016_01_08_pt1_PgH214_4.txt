ABSURD COMMENTS ABOUT ABORTION
(Ms. MOORE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, over the years, I have heard some rather
absurd comments from my Republican colleagues about abortion. Some have
compared Planned Parenthood to drug dealers, abortion factories, and
the Ku Klux Klan. I have even heard grown men debate ``legitimate
rape'' on live TV. I have even heard a Republican lawmaker put forth
the claim that, if women are allowed to have abortions, men should be
allowed to rape.
After nearly 30 years of public office, nothing really surprises me
anymore, Mr. Speaker. So you can imagine my lack of astonishment when
my dear friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Sean Duffy, rolled out
abortion statistics among African American women to lecture Black
legislators like myself about defending the welfare of our
constituents.
Since the United States Supreme Court ruled in 1963 that women are
guaranteed the privacy and power and right to make medical decisions
concerning their own bodies, anti-choice legislators have been trying
to end safe and legal abortion. A tactic that has been part of their
strategy is to use inflammatory, racial arguments, and deceptive claims
to stigmatize abortion in communities of color.
I don't expect Representative Duffy to understand why his comments
are offensive, but what he and so many of his Republican colleagues
fail to acknowledge is the underlying context behind high abortion
rates in African American communities.
High rates of abortion are related to poverty and lack of access to
quality care. The war on women's health centers has resulted in
multiple barriers to accessing quality, affordable health care, which
could lead to higher rates of both unintended pregnancy and abortion.
Representative Duffy's hypocrisy on this issue is as predictable as
it is offensive. If he truly, truly wants to fight for the hopeless and
voiceless, he should join us.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman from Wisconsin
has expired.
Parliamentary Inquiry
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary
inquiry.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. What is the rule on attacking personalities in the
House?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. House rule XVII prohibits Members from
engaging in personalities in debate.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Did the prior speech violate that rule?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot give an advisory opinion on
that.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
