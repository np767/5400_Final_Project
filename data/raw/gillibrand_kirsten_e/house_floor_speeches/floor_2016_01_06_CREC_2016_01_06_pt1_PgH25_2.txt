GUNS
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, last year more than 13,000 Americans lost
their lives because of a gun. More than 3,300 children were killed or
injured. As the President said yesterday, the question of whether we
address gun violence is really a question about who we are and what
kind of country we want to live in.
Do we want to be a country in which we have a mass shooting nearly
every single day of the year? Do we want to be a country in which
children in a school have to practice hiding silently under their desks
or in a closet in order to avoid an active shooter? Do we want to be a
country in which the National Rifle Association buys influence and
drowns out the voices of concerned citizens? Do we want to be a country
in which all Congress does after a mass shooting is hold another moment
of silence instead of addressing the problem?
That is the country we live in today, a country in which gun violence
threatens lives every day, a country in which we are growing accustomed
to atrocities that just don't happen as often in other developed
countries.
Mr. Speaker, we can do better. The President has done his job. Now it
is time for Congress to do its job.
Let's pass universal background checks. Let's do more to keep guns
from criminals and from those with serious mental illness, such that
possessing a gun would pose a threat to themselves or others. Let's get
military-style assault weapons out of our communities. Let's do better.
