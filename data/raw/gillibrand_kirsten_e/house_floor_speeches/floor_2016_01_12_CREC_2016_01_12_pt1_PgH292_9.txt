IN HONOR OF U.S. ARMY STAFF SERGEANT MATTHEW McCLINTOCK
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize U.S. Army Staff Sergeant
Matthew McClintock, a fallen hero who answered the call to serve his
country.
Last week I had the solemn honor of joining his family--his wife,
Ali, his 3-month-old son, Declan, his parents, and others--at Dover Air
Force Base for Sergeant McClintock's final trip home. It was an
experience I will never forget. It is important that his service and
the sacrifice that he and his family have made be acknowledged here in
the House of Representatives.
Sergeant McClintock joined the Army in 2006, and he served in both
Iraq and Afghanistan. On his most recent deployment, he was serving as
a citizen soldier in a National Guard Special Forces unit.
Not only will he be remembered as a Green Beret and as a hero, he
will be remembered as a loving son, husband, and father who was so
proud to welcome his son into the world. That world is stronger and
better because of his service.
Nothing we can say can ease his family's pain, but I can promise that
the service of this hero and his sacrifice will not be forgotten. It
will live on in the memories of those he called comrades and in the
memories of his commanders, who routinely cite the example he set.
It will live on in the gratitude of this Nation. Most importantly, it
will live on with his wife, son, and other family members, who knew
better than anyone else his love for his country and for the people in
his life.
