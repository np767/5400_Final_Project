CONGRATULATING ZIPPY DUVALL, FARM BUREAU FEDERATION'S NEW PRESIDENT
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, today I join my colleagues in the Georgia
delegation, Representative Austin Scott and Representative Buddy
Carter, to recognize Zippy Duvall, the American Farm Bureau
Federation's new president.
As a third-generation dairy farmer, who better than Zippy would know
what our farmers and agriculture sector need to succeed?
Zippy and his wife, Bonnie, maintain a 300-head beef cow herd,
produce quality hay, and have developed a very successful poultry
production company, growing out over 75,000 broilers per year.
Zippy formerly served as president of the Georgia Farm Bureau, and
will replace president Bob Stall, the national president, who is
retiring after 16 years.
Zippy has a passion for agriculture like no other. It is in his
blood.
[[Page H357]]
Agriculture is Georgia's number one industry, and we are proud that a
great Georgian has filled this national and important role.
As members of the House Committee on Agriculture, we look forward to
working with Zippy, and wish him all the best as he begins this new
journey in his life.
Congratulations to Zippy and Bonnie Duvall. I know the American Farm
Bureau Federation will be served well with Zippy as president.
