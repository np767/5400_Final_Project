RECOGNIZING CLIFF KOROLL
(Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for
1
[[Page H6]]
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Cliff Koroll, a Chicago
Blackhawks legend.
After signing with the Blackhawks in 1969, Cliff enjoyed 11 seasons
as their right winger, where he reached the 50-point mark during four
different seasons. He also helped lead the Blackhawks to the Stanley
Cup finals twice and later served six seasons as their assistant coach.
His talent led him to be inducted into multiple sports halls of fame,
but his greatest accomplishment is leading the Chicago Blackhawks
Alumni Association. This group of retired players continually gives
back to the Chicago community and has given over $1 million in
scholarships to the most deserving high school players in Illinois.
Cliff is also a supporter of the Chicago Legal Clinic, which provides
legal services for immigrants, the disabled, victims of domestic
violence, consumers with serious debt issues, and more.
Today I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring and celebrating
Cliff's work and accomplishments.
