IMPROVING SECURITY IN OUR COMMUNITIES
(Mr. JOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of talk this week about
improving security in our communities. One way we can do that as a
country is to stand shoulder to shoulder with our law enforcement
officers. Just as they get our back each day, let us get theirs.
Tomorrow is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. We can show our
appreciation in this House by bringing up and passing legislation I
have introduced called the Thin Blue Line Act, now with over 50
cosponsors on both sides of the Capitol. It simply gives prosecutors
and judges greater flexibility to impose enhanced penalties on those
who do harm to law enforcement officers.
Law enforcement officers each year are subject to over 50,000
assaults on them, 15,000 with injuries, and 150 unfortunately leading
to law enforcement deaths.
The Thin Blue Line Act says very simply, if you take the life of a
law enforcement officer, be prepared to lose your own.
Mr. Speaker, let's stand with law enforcement officers today and each
day in this House.
