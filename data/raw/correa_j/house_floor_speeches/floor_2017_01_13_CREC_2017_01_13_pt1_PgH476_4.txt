NOT ATTENDING INAUGURATION
(Mr. GRIJALVA asked and was given permission to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell my constituents that
I will not be attending the inauguration of Donald Trump as our next
President.
My absence is not motivated by disrespect for the office or motivated
by disrespect for the government that we have in this great democracy
but as an individual act, yes, of defiance at the disrespect shown to
millions and millions of Americans by this incoming administration and
by the actions we are taking in this Congress.
The majority of voters rejected Trump. They deserve respect. The 20
million-plus Americans threatened by the repeal of the Affordable Care
Act without a replacement deserve respect. The millions who did not
vote because they blame both parties deserve respect.
I will be at home in Arizona meeting with seniors, the immigrant
community, folks who care about the environment and climate change,
healthcare providers, and marching in Tucson with folks who will demand
respect. I will be talking about the need to defend and protect the
future for all Americans.
Rather than participate in the inauguration, I will be participating
in my district and reaffirming and renewing this democracy and the
people that are part of it.
