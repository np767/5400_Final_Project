HONORING MAJOR TRAVIS BRUNELLE
(Mr. JOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a man who spent his
entire adult life serving our country, a man who served with great
distinction, and a man who truly was an American patriot. Mr. Speaker,
I rise today to honor U.S. Army Major Travis Brunelle of Tampa,
Florida.
Major Brunelle enlisted in the Army in 1991. In 2002, he graduated
from Florida State University with a bachelor's degree in information
studies and was commissioned a 2nd lieutenant in the infantry, gaining
his commission through ROTC at Florida State. He attended the Infantry
Officer's Basic Course, where he served as a platoon leader and would
go on to attend the Special Forces Officers Qualification Course. In
October 2004, Brunelle earned the coveted Green Beret.
Then-Captain Brunelle served as a detachment commander for Company C,
3rd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group. He deployed in support of
Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.
For his service to our Nation, Brunelle was decorated with two

Bronze Star Medals, three Army Commendation Medals, four Army
Achievement Medals, and multiple OEF and OIF deployment ribbons.
Additional recognitions included the Expert Infantryman Badge, Combat
Infantryman Badge, Master Parachutist Badge, Ranger Tab, and the
Special Forces Tab.
A Master Mason and president of the Tampa Bay Ranger Regiment
motorcycle club, Major Brunelle was known by his community as selfless,
compassionate, and full of life.
Today, Major Brunelle is survived by his wife, Renee, and many
countless, loving friends and family. May God bless Major Travis
Brunelle for his service to our Nation. May God bless his family, his
friends, and may God bless the country he so valiantly and proudly
fought for, the United States of America.
