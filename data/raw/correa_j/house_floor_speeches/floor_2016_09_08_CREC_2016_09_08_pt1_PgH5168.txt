HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF DALLAS KNOX
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. Jolly) for 5 minutes.
Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and legacy
of an American patriot, a patriot who served his country with honor and
distinction before passing away last month in a boating accident at
only 35 years old.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Chief Warrant Officer Dallas Knox
of Treasure Island, Florida. Chief Knox faithfully served his country
as a Black Hawk Medevac helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army and the Army
Reserve. Chief Knox had multiple deployments, including tours in
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo. Chief Knox also served as a Black Hawk
instructor pilot.
Having attended his memorial service, his colleagues each spoke that
Dallas was one of the most gifted pilots they ever served with, a man
of bravery, valor, always thoughtful, and always giving to others.
The medals Knox earned for his service speak volumes about his
dedication and his commitment to the country he so loved. Knox was
awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the
Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Iraq Campaign
Medal with Bronze Service Star, and the Global War on Terrorism Service
Medal, among so many other awards.
Described by his family as selfless, compassionate, loving, and full
of life, Chief Knox is survived by his mother, Carol, his father,
Richard, sister, Kirsten, as well as loving nieces and nephews.
May God bless Chief Warrant Officer Dallas Knox, his family, and his
friends; and may God bless the country Chief Knox so proudly fought
for, the United States of America.
