TRIBUTE TO CLARENCE J. ``BUD'' BROWN, JR.
______
HON. JIM JORDAN
of ohio
in the house of representatives
Friday, June 16, 2017
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to commend to the House the
admirable service of former Congressman Clarence J. ``Bud'' Brown, Jr.,
on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday on June 18.
Born in Columbus in 1927, Bud spent much of his youth in the
Washington area, as his father, the late former Congressman Clarence J.
Brown, Sr., represented Ohio's Seventh Congressional District in the
House from 1939 to 1965. A Navy veteran of World War II and the Korean
War, Bud was a 1947 graduate of Duke University and a 1949 graduate of
Harvard Business School.
Bud succeeded his father in Congress in 1965, representing the people
of the Seventh District with distinction until 1983. Following his
House service, he was tapped by President Reagan to serve as the
nation's fifth Deputy Secretary of Commerce. He ably filled the role of
Acting Secretary for several months following the 1987 death of
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge.
From 1992 to 1999, Bud served as President and Chief Executive
Officer of the United States Capitol Historical Society, a
congressionally chartered non-profit organization dedicated to
preserving the heritage and history of the Capitol. The Society honored
him with its Freedom Award in 2000, created to recognize those who
advance the understanding and appreciation of representative
government.
Throughout his life, Bud worked in various roles at the family-owned
Brown Publishing Company, a vast nationwide network of local newspapers
that was in business through 2010. Bud oversaw company operations from
its headquarters in Urbana, Ohio, as President and later as Chairman of
the Board for many years.
Bud and his wife, Joyce, are the proud parents of four children:
Cate, Clancy, Roy, and Beth. Beth died in 1964 at age seven after a
three-year battle with leukemia; Bud and Joyce established the Beth
Brown Memorial Foundation in her name later that year. Foundation
scholarships have helped hundreds of high school graduates from
Champaign County study medical and related careers in college.
Bud and Joyce have both been active in promoting the Cedar Bog Nature
Preserve, a 450-acre site south of Urbana that is considered a crown
jewel of Ohio's natural areas. They were instrumental in building the
Preserve's endowment fund and in making its new education center a
reality.
This Sunday in Urbana, Bud's family and friends will gather at an
open house in his honor. I look forward to joining so many other well-
wishers on this occasion to thank Bud and Joyce for their years of
selfless sacrifices.
Mr. Speaker, Bud Brown has been a personal friend and mentor for many
years who has made service to others the foundation of his life. We are
grateful that good men like Bud commit their lives to public service
and inspire others to follow in their footsteps.
