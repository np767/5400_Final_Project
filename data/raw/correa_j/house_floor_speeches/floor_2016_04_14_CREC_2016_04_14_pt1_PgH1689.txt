RECOGNIZING MORTON PLANT HOSPITAL
(Mr. JOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Morton Plant
Hospital, which celebrates its 100th anniversary this year.
In 1912, Mr. Morton Plant was vacationing in Pinellas County,
Florida, when his son, Henry, was seriously injured. He quickly
realized the closest medical care was a day's drive, so he offered the
community a $100,000 endowment to open a local hospital. On January 1,
1916, the Morton F. Plant Endowed Hospital opened with 20 beds and 5
bassinets.
In the decades to come, Morton Plant Hospital would emerge at the
forefront of cardiovascular health, orthopedics, neuroscience,
emergency care, and neonatal health.
It has been awarded the baby-friendly hospital status by the United
Nations Children's Fund. It has also been recognized by the Florida
Hospital Association as the innovation of the year in patient care.
Most notably, it is the only hospital in the United States to be
awarded for 13 consecutive years the Top 100 Hospitals designation by
Thomson Reuters.
Morton Plant was created out of a community effort, and the hospital
continues to serve the Pinellas County community. I congratulate them
on 100 years of service, and I offer the sincere gratitude of our
Pinellas County community for Morton Plant's tireless work on behalf of
patients and families.
