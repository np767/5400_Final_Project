        "transcript": " Thank you. Thank you. And thank you to the women who are leading in Massachusetts. Yes. Yes. Oh. When I first ran for the Senate six years ago, I asked you to take a chance on someone who had never even run for office before. You took that chance. You sent me into the fight. And tonight you told me to stay in the fight. I am deeply grateful. And I promise I will never stop working my heart out for you. Never. Yeah. It has been a tough two years. But together, together, we have marched, together, we have run, together, we have persisted and insisted that our voices be heard, that our votes be counted, and that our values be respected. And in two months, and at least for the next two years, the House of Representatives, the People's House, is going to do a lot more work for the people. So tonight, I make you this promise. We are just getting started. You know, we know what we believe in, and we know whose side we're on. We came to this movement to pick a fight, a fight on behalf of millions of Americans who are getting ripped off in a rigged economy and ignored by a corrupt government in Washington. We came to this fight for families trying to stretch a paycheck, and for people living one moment away from a medical bill that would send them spiraling over a financial cliff. We came to fight for seniors trying to make it on social security, and for dreamers trying to make it in the only country they've ever known. We came to fight for workers who want to build a union, and for unions who want to rebuild America's middle class. We came to fight for firefighters facing cancer, for nurses busting their tails to save lives, and for public schoolteachers reaching into their own pockets to buy crayons for their kids. We came to fight for loved ones caught in the grip of the opioid crisis, for families shattered by gun violence, and for communities of color devastated by a broken criminal justice system. We came to fight for decency, we came to fight for justice, we came to fight for change, and now tonight we take that fight to Washington to make our government work not just for the rich and the powerful, but make it work for everyone else. So tonight is a night to celebrate how far our movement has come, but it is also a night to remember just how it began. And let's make sure that nobody re-writes history. This resistance began with women, and it is being led by women tonight. Two years ago, on a very dark election night, millions of women watched in horror as Donald Trump was elected president. They didn't like it, but they didn't whimper, they didn't whine, they fought back. Women knitted hats, and they painted signs, and they took to the streets by the millions, raising their voices until they could no longer be ignored. They went to rallies, they went to town halls, they went to training sessions, they became organizers, fundraisers, campaign managers, by the dozens, by the hundreds. Women who had never run for anything before stepped up to put their names on the ballot. A record-breaking number of women. A record-breaking number of women, especially women of color, including our on-ion oppressors jumped into the fight. And it was something. They ignored the party bosses who said they should wait their turn. They ignored the consultants who said they should cover up their tattoos and smile more. And they ignored the powerful men of the Republican party who never took them seriously anyway. They refused to let anyone shut them up or stand in their way, and that is how real change begins. It's there. We've seen white women learn from black women how to organize and mobilize. Older women partnering with younger women to take to the streets. Married singles, straight lesbian and trans women, rich and poor women, building alliances with each other, and yeah, building alliances with the men who also want to make real change in this country. People who never thought of themselves as activists embraced their power, took their seats at the table, and inspired others. Glass shattered, barriers broke, more people who had always been told to wait and wait and wait. And decided the time for waiting was over and the time to act had come. So, earlier this year, I called one of those first time candidates. A woman named Leobah Gretchen Shirley. Now, Leobah was running a tough race for Congress, and the pundits were given her no chance of winning, none at all. But that's not what Leobah was worried about on the day I called. Nope. She was worried about her two-year-old son, Nicholas, who had tripped on a toy and broken his leg. Now, she could have given up, but she didn't. Instead, she practiced her stump speech while she gave Nikki and his sister their baths, and she balanced fundraising calls with calls to the insurance company, which by the way refused to cover Nikki's hospital stay. But I'll tell you, it reminded me of how I felt when I was a young teacher back at the University of Houston. I was having a tough time managing two little kids and a brand new job. And one night, my 77-year-old aunt B called long distance from Oklahoma just to see how I was doing. Fine, I said. And then I would know where. I just burst into tears. It was too much. I felt like a failure. And without even planning to say it, the words just fell out of my mouth. I'm going to quit my job. Now, Aunt B waited for me to stop crying, the blow my nose, to get a drink of water, all long distance. And she said, I can't get there tomorrow, but I can come on Thursday. She showed up with seven suitcases and a pecanese named Buddy and stayed for 16 years. Thank you, Aunt B. So I'm talking to Leoba. And Leoba said she had heard that story. And then she started to cry. It's hard. It's hard for millions of working moms who don't have an aunt B. Moms fighting to make ends meet, fighting to create a better future, fighting a system that's rigged to undermine working women, to lock women of color out of opportunity, and to keep power in the hands of privileged men. But for Leoba and the other women who ran this year, they wouldn't let anything stop them. That's how it is. And here's the deal. No matter what happens in Leoba's race tonight, she's one of this year's big winners, because she became the first woman ever to get federal officials to approve using campaign funds to pay for child care. Now that's real change. Thank you, Aunt B. Leoba. Together, women and men, young and old, black and white, gay and straight, in cities big and small, have built something extraordinary. And whether you ran for office or ran a phone bank, whether you won or you lost or you're still waiting for the votes to be counted, whether this was your first time getting off the sidelines or you've been in this fight your whole life, everyone who helped make tonight possible should know two things. First, you have more power than you ever imagined. And second, you've got to stay in the fight. The road ahead of us will not be easy. Trust me. The powerful in Washington don't give up just because they get knocked down. Our government is still captured by the wealthy and the well connected, and the economy is still rigged against working people, women and communities of color. Our Supreme Court is still packed with right wing activists who believe that the wealthy and the well connected should get to call the shots. And Donald Trump still practices the dark art of ruling by fear. Fear whipped up to turn hardworking Americans against hardworking Americans. And while he's got everyone busy yelling and fighting, Mitch McConnell gets to raid the treasury and give a trillion and a half dollars to his rich friends. Yeah. Oh, and by the way, Mitch is still plotting to destroy healthcare for millions of families and slash social security and Medicare. Yeah. Yeah. It's gonna be hard. Nevertheless, we will persist. And we will deliver the change this country deserves. Oh, well. So we've got a lot of races still undecided tonight. But before I let you get back to your television sets and check it online, which I noticed somebody over there is doing. I actually, I just want to say some thanks. First, running for office is an investment in democracy. It isn't easy and anyone who steps up deserves credit. So I want to say thank you to my opponent for stepping up. Thank you, Jeff Deal. Thank you. And for everyone else who made an investment in democracy, thank you. Thank you for putting up a lawn sign or coming to a rally or donating ten bucks or just making the time to vote. You make democracy work. And thank you to my sweetie Bruce, who understands the most important things in life. And in the middle of a hard campaign came home with a new puppy. Thank you. And thank you to the people of this Commonwealth. Every single one of you, whether you voted for me or not, I am grateful for the opportunity to fight for you. Thank you. So thank you all. But remember, your work isn't done. So much depends on what we do next. Donald Trump and his corrupt friends have spent the last two years building walls of anger and division and resentment. And as the first cracks begin to appear in that wall, let us declare that our fight is not over until we have transformed our government. Transformed our government into one that works not just for the rich and the powerful but works for everyone. And tomorrow, we get right back in the fight. The fight for a day when corporations don't write all the rules. The fight for a day when corrupt politicians don't escape justice. The fight for a new day in America with a new kind of politics, a politics of inclusion, not resentment. Yes, a politics of courage, not fear. We have come so far together. We have fought together, cried together, resisted together, and sure as hell persisted together. But tonight, we send a message to the world. We're just getting started.",

        "transcript": " Tonight, we've heard from the people who make America work. People who put their lives on the line to keep our country going, and since COVID-19 hit, they've taken one gut punch after another. And what does the COVID fall out, done to our babies? Well, I'm here at the early childhood education center in Springfield, Massachusetts, which has been closed for months. Child care was already hard to find before the pandemic, and now, parents are stuck. No idea when schools can safely reopen and even fewer child care options. The devastation is enormous. And the way I see it, big problems demand big solutions. Now, I love a good plan, and Joe Biden has some really good plans. Plans to bring back union jobs and manufacturing and create new union jobs and clean energy. Plans to increase social security benefits, cancel billions in student loan debt, and make our bankruptcy laws work for families instead of the creditors who cheat them. These plans reflect a central truth. Our economic system has been rigged to give bailouts to billionaires and kick dirt in the face of everyone else. But we can build a thriving economy by investing in families and fixing what's broken. Joe's plan to build back better includes making the wealthy pay their fair share, holding corporations accountable, repairing racial inequities, and fighting corruption in Washington. Let me tell you about one of Joe's plans that's especially close to my heart, child care. As a little girl growing up in Oklahoma, what I wanted most in the world was to be a teacher. I loved teaching, and when I had babies and was juggling my first big teaching job down in Texas, it was hard. But I could do hard. The thing that almost sent me child care. One night my aunt bee called just to check in, and I thought I was fine. But then I just broke down and started to cry. I had tried holding it all together, but without reliable child care, working was nearly impossible. And when I told Aunt Bee I was going to quit my job, I thought my heart would break. And then she said the words that changed my life. I can't get there tomorrow, but I'll come on Thursday. And she arrived with seven suitcases and a peeking ease named Buddy and stayed for 16 years. I get to be here tonight because of my aunt bee. I learned a fundamental truth. Nobody makes it on their own. And yet here we are. Two generations of working parents later. And if you have a baby and don't have an aunt bee, you're on your own. And here's why that is wrong. We build infrastructure like roads and bridges and communication systems so that people can work. That infrastructure helps us all because it keeps our economy going. It's time to recognize that child care is part of the basic infrastructure of this nation. It's infrastructure for families. Joe and Kamala will make high quality child care affordable for every family. Make preschool a universal and raise the wages of every child care worker. Now that's just one plan, but it gives you an idea of how we get this country working for everyone. Donald Trump's ignorance and incompetence have always been a danger to our country. COVID-19 was Trump's biggest test. He failed miserably. Today, America has the most COVID deaths in the world and an economic collapse. And both crises are falling hardest on black and brown families. Millions out of work, millions more trapped in cycles of poverty. Millions on the brink of losing their homes, millions of restaurants and stores hanging by a thread. This crisis is bad and it didn't have to be this way. This crisis is on Donald Trump and the Republicans who enabled him. On November 3rd, we will hold them all accountable. So whether you're planning to vote, wearing a mask or vote by mail, please take out your phone, right now, and text vote to 3-0-3-3-0. We all need to be in the fight to get Joe and Kamala elected. And after November, we all need to stay in the fight to get big things done. We stay in this fight so that when our children and our grandchildren ask what we did during this dark chapter in our nation's history, we will be able to look them squarely in the eye and say we organized, we persisted, and we changed America.",

        "transcript": " Hello, Massachusetts Democrats! Oh, wow! What a night! Results are still coming in across the country, but here at home in Massachusetts we've got a lot to celebrate. We can see our future, and it is bright, and it is blue. Now, over this past year, I'm going to give you the teacher look. So, over this last year, across this Commonwealth, people of conscience came together to stand up for democracy. We nominated great candidates, and we worked hard to get them elected. We knocked on doors, we made phone calls, we rallied, we marched, and because we did, we won big in Massachusetts, and you're the ones who got it done. And now, the votes are in, and we are sending a battle-tested leader to Beacon Hill, who has shattered a couple of glass ceilings along the way. We have elected a woman who fights for working families, a warrior who is done toe-to-toe, with big oil and for-profit colleges. We've made more and healy the next governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I want to add, we have also sent one of the Commonwealth's most effective mayors, a smart, principled leader, to fight alongside Mora on Beacon Hill, with made Kim Driscoll the next lieutenant governor. Oh, and we can't quit without saying, we have put a defender of equality and opportunity, a woman who knows the power of turning pain into purpose to be the people's lawyer, we made Andrea Campbell our next attorney, Jay. And fingers crossed, we're electing a fierce advocate for accountability, Diana de Zoglio for our next auditor. We have a proven champion for working families back into office, Deb Goldberg for treasure, and up and down the ballot tonight, Massachusetts has chosen leaders with vision, whose value is aligned with the will of the people. And I want to say, that matters now more than ever. Here at home and across the country, we're up against Republican extremists. They are willing to overturn election results that don't suit them. They parrot the big lie, they embrace violent insurrection, and they are determined to silence our voices, steal our votes. And deny our freedom. That is the Republican agenda. It is a war on our freedom, it is a war on our democracy. And that is why here in Massachusetts, Republicans lost. They lost big time. Massachusetts said to Republicans, not here, not here on the ugliness and the hate, not here on the deception and the flat out lies, not here on the attacks on the very foundation of our democracy. When the Republicans try to control who you marry and which books you can read, we say not here. When Republicans try to make this economy work better for billionaires and billionaire corporations and leave working families behind here in Massachusetts, we say not here. And when Republicans try to control access to abortion and birth control, we say not here. We say not here, but the Republicans keep banging on the door, both locally and nationally. Look, we are in for some tough times. And here's what I know for sure. Mora will fight for you. Kim will fight for you. Andrea will fight for you. Diana and Deb will fight for you. Ayanna will fight for you. Katherine will fight for you. And Ed and I, I promise, will be in Washington fighting for you. We will not give an inch to these power hungry liars, because here's what I understand. When we stand together, when we persist together, we win together. So Massachusetts, thank you for giving us Mora. Thank you for giving us a great team. It's a proud night in Massachusetts. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, thank you so Chris, thanks very much for the introduction. I'm glad you picked up the highlights. I think you were pretty plain spoken too, as we got to be there. Here I just want to start by saying it is so good to be with you. This is my kind of crowd. Yeah! You bet. Hardworking folks from all across the country who want to rain in walls street and who want to level the playing field for working families. I am proud, proud to have a chance to stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this fight. You bet. That's what we're here for. So today I'm here to talk about Wall Street. And I got some good news and some bad news about this. Let's start with the bad news. We all know what happened. The banks caused the worst financial crisis in three generations. They cost millions of people their jobs, their homes, their savings. And those Wall Street bankers, the ones that broke the economy, they're not ashamed. They haven't seen the error of their ways and retreated. Nope. Just the opposite. They have doubled down on the armies of lobbyists and lawyers. They are trolling the halls of Congress trying to delay and weaken all of the rules that need to be put in place and trying to open up new loopholes for them to exploit. That is the bad news. And it is real and it's tough out there. Now let's do some good news. The good news is that with Dodd Frank and the consumer agency, we have proven that a dedicated group of activists combined with the voices of millions of people across this country can stand up to Wall Street and make real change in this country. That's what we have proven. We've done it before and we'll do it again. That's what this is about. So the question is where do we go from here? How do we build on Dodd Frank? And for me, it just comes down to two simple principles. First, financial institutions shouldn't be allowed to cheat people. I know pretty controversial in some places but just bear with me on this one. And the second is financial institutions shouldn't be allowed to force taxpayers to take on risks just so that banks can increase their profits. So those are the two basic principles. And I want to be clear that it is departure from those two principles. No cheating and no pushing risk on taxpayers that caused the 2008 financial crisis. It is that simple. Lenders got away with tricking and trapping people with shady mortgages. Big banks bought up those mortgages and they sliced and diced and packaged them into mortgage-backed securities. And then they misled investors about what those packages were all about. And when the whole thing went belly up, the banks came right here to Washington with their hands out knowing that Congress would bail them out rather than let the economy go over a cliff. And it's core Dodd Frank was about trying to get back to those two basic principles. No cheating, no pushing the risk onto the taxpayers. And I want to say, it's actually made a lot of progress. So let's talk about that first principle, no more cheating people. With the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Yay! Yay! Something that people in this room fought for and that's how we got it. But with the creation of that agency, Dodd Frank took a powerful step toward honest markets and weeding out the businesses that rely on cheating people. It's not perfect yet, but we now have one agency focused on doing exactly that. Weeding out the tricks and traps in mortgages, credit cards, student loans, other financial products. And here's the best part. That little agency been up and running just for a short time. It has already forced the biggest financial institutions in this country to return more than $11 billion directly to people they cheated. That is government that works for the people. People, yes. You bet. But we still got a lot of work to do. And our work starts with protecting what we have, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The big banks and their friends here in Washington are doing everything they can to hamstring this agency. They've spent money on campaigns. It's amazing. On ad campaigns attacking me, attacking Rich Cordray, who's the director, and attacking the work that the agency does. And boy, what that tells me is it's time for us to fight back, to protect that agency, to keep it working for the people. That's work we got to do, but I want to throw out a couple of things in addition. As long as you're keeping your cheat sheet there of things, when we go around and talk to people who want to be sure to talk about, it's the Consumer Agency, but I got another one. We need to get the Department of Justice and the SEC to take off the kid gloves and start holding some big banks and senior executives accountable when they break the law. Yeah. These agencies don't take anyone to trial ever, which means nobody gets threatened with jail time. Look, we can find these guys until the cows come home. But for them, it's just really going to be a cost of doing business. If we really want to change the culture on Wall Street, if we really want to deter rampant misconduct and breaking the law, we need to haul some people out in handcuffs. That's what will keep bankers up at night. You bet. You bet. Yes. I didn't do this. Good. One more on our list. Remember this. More than a quarter of families in America have no checking or savings account. These families rely on payday lenders and check cashing outfits, which can trick and trap people into paying rates that they can't afford. Now, the CFPB has just announced a rule to try to rain in payday lending. But we could do something else really innovative here. I'm all for what CFPB is doing. But what we could do is we could let the United States post office start offering basic banking services. Yes. It's just so straightforward. The basic stuff, the bill paying, the check cashing, the small loans, so that individual families are not driven to the payday lenders that rip them off. This is one of those proposals that's good for families, good for the post office, and good for postal workers. Let's do this one. Let's do this one. We can do this. So, three on no cheating. Let's talk about the second goal. No two big to fail banks pushing the risk off on to taxpayers. You know, that's got to be right. Dodd Frank actually puts some discipline into the system. But let's get real. Dodd Frank did not end two big to fail. If you think it did, please stand on your head right now. I don't see anybody standing on their head because you'll if you what we have to understand is the basic facts here. Many of the big banks are bigger than they were when the economy crashed back in 2008. At the end of 2014, they got the law changed so they could bring risky derivatives onto their balance sheet. And how much is the estimate now in how many risky derivatives they brought onto their balance sheet? 10 trillion dollars in additional risk. And just two months ago, the Fed and the FDIC said that eight of the nine largest banks in this country were so big and so dangerous that if any one of them started to fail, they would bring down the whole economy unless they got a bailout. Two big to fail still stalks this economy. So the question is what should we do to end it once and for all? Here's an idea. Let's break them up. Let's break up the big banks. Gee, that wasn't so hard. Think about the different ways we can do this. We should impose a cap on bank size just like Senator Sherrod Brown and Ted Kaufman proposed during the Dodd-Frank debate. And we should separate boring basic banking from the risky investment banking by adopting a 21st century glass stigle. We're ready to go on this. All we need are the fighters. Do we have any fighters in this room? That's what we need. That's what we need. Good. So look, these are changes that can make a real difference. They can protect hard working families from cheats and liars. They can help rain in, recklessness and greed on Wall Street. They can end too big to fail. But most of all, these changes will make our financial markets stronger and healthier and give working families a fighting chance to build a real future for themselves and for their children. That's what this is about. Let's face it, this will not be an easy fight. Wall Street has money. Lots of it. They have money. They have lobbyists and they have plenty of access to congressmen and senators. But we didn't take on this fight because it is easy. The people in this room took on this fight because it is right. We took on this fight because families who can't be with us here in Washington, because families who don't have a voice in the halls of Congress are counting on us. For me, this is about America's economy, but more than that, this is about America's values. This is about the kind of country we are going to build. And whether or not we are a country committed to a future, not just for some of our children, but for all of our children. I am proud to be here with you. You bet. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " We all lived through a bit of an earthquake Tuesday night. A couple of days after the election, you said you gave a speech to the AFL-CIO and you said this. If we learned nothing else from the past two years of electioneering, we should hear the message loud and clear that the American people want Washington to change. It was clear in the Democratic primaries. It was clear in the Republican primaries. It was clear in the campaign and it was clear on election day. How do Democrats show that they heard that message? What do they do now? I think the interesting question is going to be both hats. How are the Democrats going to show it and how is Donald Trump going to show that he actually heard that message? That's the message he ran on. But right now what Donald Trump is doing is putting together a transition team that is full of lobbyists and the kind of people that he actually ran against. And so part of what we have to assess here is what is the mandate coming out? And I think that the clearest point that comes out of this election is that the American people do not want Wall Street to run their government. They do not want corporate executives to be the ones who are calling the shots in Washington. And you can shake your head no to that. But I think that is exactly what this election shows. It shows, look at the polling from this, that about three quarters of all Americans do believe that the game is rigged. And that's Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. And they believe it is rigged in favor of the people in this room and that it is rigged against them and their families and their children. And they want to see change. They want to see that connection between Wall Street and giant corporations and our government broken. They want that not to happen anymore. They want a government that runs for the people. That's what I think this election is about. So how do the two parties show that? If that's, if that's your less water Democrats do, what does the Trump transition slash administration do that it's not doing now in your government? It doesn't start by hiring a bunch of lobbyists to run the transition. It doesn't start by floating names of people who have run giant hedge funds to be able to be a part of that to be able to run the Treasury or people who come from industry to be able to run the regulatory agencies. You know, the American people understand about the revolving door and I think they're really sick of it. The notion that someone is in industry and makes a bunch of money and then goes into government for a few years regulating the very same industry and then spends right back into industry again. But, you know, elections have consequences. Sure they do. He won. He gets to do, he gets to pick his administration. He won, but I'm just making the point. You better take a look at what he won on. He did not want win on a Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, business as usual. What can we do to help the giant corporations in America? Look, I know that the K Street lobbyists are absolutely out there salivating. You know, they're dancing in the streets. They say this is our big chance. We're going to get to slash regulations. Man, look for a tax cut for those at the top. That's what the K Street lobbyists may be thinking this morning, but that is not with the people who elected Donald Trump are thinking this morning. If you look at the populist part of the Trump message, one would think, and I think you've talked about this. There are things where, frankly Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump started together and proceeded together. Wall Street, as you said, college costs, childcare, infrastructure spending. Is there a place there on any of those or all of those subjects where populists in the Democratic Party and a Trump administration could come together? Can you see that happening? Well, the question, I mean, this just keeps going back to what is Donald Trump going to do. He's now, it's been a week. He's now given us at least the first tangible sign of his vision of how to run a Trump presidency. And a big part of that are lobbyists and Washington insiders. And the other part of it is to bring someone who is a white supremacist into the White House to be a senior strategist. And I think this is going to be an important part of the mix going forward. What Donald Trump is doing right now is that there was a lot, what's face it? There was a lot during the election of a toxic stew of bigotry and attacks on Americans all across this country. And that Donald Trump started his campaign with an attack on Mexican Americans and then he rode the escalator down. And he did attacks on women. He did attacks on African Americans. He did attacks on Muslims. He did attacks on immigrants. He did attacks on people with disabilities. It was kind of everybody who didn't look like the people who showed up at his rallies. And there were a lot of people who were attracted to that. But there were a lot of people who were not attracted to that. And yet voted for Donald Trump. There are a lot of people who didn't like that part of what the campaign was about. But they said we want somebody who's going to shake it up. But one of the first things Donald Trump has now done is he has brought Steve Bannon in as a senior strategist. This is a man who has white supremacist ties. I mean that's what he does. This is a man who's who told his ex-wife that he didn't want his children going to school with Jews. This is a man who ran a news organization that ran headlines like would you rather your children have feminism or cancer? This is a man who says by his very presence that this is a white house that will embrace bigotry. And here I am with the business leaders of America. I just want to underline something that every one of you know. Bigotry is bad for business. Bigotry is not what your employees expect. Bigotry is not what your customers expect. And if that's the direction that this administration goes, that creates a real problem for everybody. And what I believe about this is there's no longer the possibility on this question of someone like Bannon in the administration of where Donald Trump goes next. I don't think it's possible to stand on the sidelines and be quiet about this. There are a lot of people in this room who help lead the charge to make workplaces open and accepting places to say we're open to all customers. We want to make sure that we serve all Americans that we treat everybody with dignity and respect. If this white house goes in a different direction, that damages every one of us. And I think it calls on the business community for leadership. I think it calls on the Democrats for leadership. But I think that's the problem we've got. And one of the ones we're going to have to deal with going forward here. But is it? But is it? But as you suggest, there are millions of people who voted for Donald Trump not for those reasons. That's exactly right. And by the way, most of those people used to be Democrats. They're union workers, white collar workers, industrial upper Midwest voters. They didn't vote for that Donald Trump. I don't think. But they voted for Donald Trump. Anyway, how did your party lose them? All the more point, though, I just want to make on that why it is that this is a moment of such urgency. That people didn't vote for Donald Trump so that he could bring a white supremacist into the white house and take his advice. And I just think this is a moment where everybody has to speak up. And I think that's true for Democrats. I think it's true for Republicans. And I think it's true for the business community. But to go back to those voters, why are they not Democrats now? Why were they Trump voters? So I think that Donald Trump made the promise to shake things up. Donald Trump, look, he made the argument over and over and over that the Democrats were too close to Wall Street and too close to big business. And I think that's the core of his economic argument that too many insiders were calling the shots that too many multinational corporations were running the trade deals. That too many people who had already made it big were using the tools of government to work for themselves and not to work for anyone else. Donald Trump, and I want to be clear, I think Hillary Clinton ran on very much the same argument. I just think Donald Trump made it aggressively, and let us do remember at the end of the day, Hillary Clinton actually got more Americans to vote for her than Donald Trump did. But the point is, you can't miss this about the election. When you tuned in, it was driving, whether they drove it effectively or whether they drove it less effectively, it was driving the message that Washington needs to work for the little guy, that Washington needs to work for the families who've been left behind, that Washington doesn't need to work for those at the top anymore. And this is so important going forward because it raises this question about what does the economic agenda look like? Let's talk about that. What should the economic agenda look like in European? What will it look like? Given the fact that there is, leaving Steve Bannon out of this conversation, at least for a minute here, there's some overlap between what Donald Trump is going to try to do, infrastructure spending, and what people in the Senate on the Democratic side, your side, would presumably like to do. Where's the overlap? How does it come together? Where is there no hope for connection? Actually, and I want to see this the other way to draw the contrast. I think there's no mandate out there for Mitch McConnell and for Paul Ryan. I think there is no mandate right now to cut regulations and say, I know, let's just turn a bunch of Wall Street banks loose and see what they will do. I mean, what could possibly go wrong? Right? Let's not remember what happened in 2008 and the run out to 2008. I think the appetite for that among the American people is zero. And I think that's exactly what was demonstrated in this election. If Mitch McConnell were here, he would say, we won control of the Senate. I would say to Mitch McConnell, we got Hillary Clinton got more votes than Donald Trump did. We took seats in the Senate and we took seats in the House. He has fewer senators on the Republican side than he had before this election. And Paul Ryan has fewer House members on the Republican side than he did before this election. What I'm saying is whether people were voting for Hillary Clinton or for most of them, whether they were voting for Donald Trump, they weren't voting for Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan's deregulatory mix. Let guys do whatever they want to do, let giant corporations do whatever they want to do. So let's talk about that regulatory agenda. Two big issues that you have been identified with very strongly. One is the Dodd-Frank legislation. And we actually have an audience question I was going to ask about this. There is a question now of what the future of Dodd-Frank is. And I think we have an audience question that can be put up. Maybe not? Yes, no. We'll skip that then. The question is, will there be a run on Dodd-Frank? Here's the question. This is what I want people in the audience. Then I want you to answer this. What happens to Dodd-Frank now? Is there some modification of it? Does it get eliminated or does it live on unchanged? That's curious what the audience thinks. Some more curious at the moment what you think. Or did you actually have to put it in the middle of the vote before I talk? I think this will take long. I don't know, I think there's some consultation going on. It's rigged. The system is clearly rigged. I don't think we can agree on that. You guys think you're punching those buttons and it's going to be long. There we go. Some modification. One in ten complete elimination and nobody thinks it lives on a shelf. Your answer. What I hope happens and what you think will happen. What I hope happens is that we have some modification. I think that Dodd-Frank was not tough enough. Donald Trump, let's just be clear here. Donald Trump said... I think they had a different kind of modification in mind. But this is the risk you run when you open something up and modify it. Where does it go? Donald Trump said that he supported Glass Steagall. We have a really good bipartisan Glass Steagall Bill. John McCain and I are co-sponsors on this. Angus King, an independent Maria Cantwell from Washington State. It's a well thought out Glass Steagall that says we're going to separate banking. It makes it safer. We're going to make boring banking more boring. And if you want to take risks, you can't get access to the guaranteed accounts that we have over in the traditional banking system. I'm going to separate those two. That's good for small banks. It's good for small businesses. It's good for the economy overall. It makes it safer. It also has a net by the way I should add. It has a lot about the better regulation of the non-bank financial institutions. So it's really about fighting the next war where many of the risks lie with non-bank financial institutions. So all I can say is the guy who's just elected president of the United States gave that one a two thumbs up. In fact, as I recall, you might all want to remember, it's in the Republican platform that this is an official party position to adopt. So if you want to ask me about modification, that's the place I'd start with modification. What's your expectation? The expectation is that there's going to be a lot of back and forth about this. A lot of Republicans have dug in on the notion that we need to roll it all back. Or this rate holds parts of it that you raise dollar limits enough that there is no effective regulation. You keep it on the books, but it's not there. I think that's going to be a battle that's going to be fought hard. And I think it's going to be one where it will be interesting to see where Donald Trump goes. But it will also be one. You think you can't get American people engaged in these economic issues? I think you can. I think the American people get this. I think the fact that I have people stop me in the grocery store to say, don't glass-stegle. Sounds a little crazy, but it's true. People get some of these basic economic points and they understand them as markers for the underlying question about who are you running the system for. Is this system here just to help a handful of giant banks who rolled over American families in the early 2000s who traded in these terrible mortgage products that ultimately blew up our economy, that cost millions of people their homes, that cost millions of people their jobs, that cost millions of people their savings. The American people have not forgotten this. I think one of the big questions still for the American people is how could it be that nobody ever went to jail over there, that we had a savings alone crisis, and hundreds of people ended up going to jail over the savings alone crisis. The idea was you just couldn't have been running the bank where the book showed this on one day and they showed this on the next day without something being wrong and what you did. And that's ultimately lots and lots of folks got invested. The reason I want to say this, I'm sorry, and then I'll quit. When we open up Dodd-Frank, we're not going to open up Dodd-Frank saying, oh, it's 2017, a new day, nothing has ever happened before. There's flowers and birds are singing. We're going to open it up with the memory of what happened in 2008, and how people took how a handful of people took down this economy, and then the part we're going to remember is what happened in the next eight years, as they got bailed out by the American taxpayers, got richer than ever, and left American families behind. And that will be the context for reopening Dodd-Frank. But one of the things that did happen in the aftermath of that was the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You had as much to do that with that as anybody. Does it survive now, or is it on what, is it going to die in the next six months? So again, who do you think you're fighting for out there? Let's be clear about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It has forced the largest financial institutions in this country to return $11 billion directly to people they cheated. It has now handled more than a million complaints. It's out there doing its job, it's leveling the playing field. It's transparent. You can look up, which banks get lots of complaints against them, and which banks don't. Where the problems are, if they're on student loans, or if problems are on credit cards, or if they're on payday loans. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is doing the people's business, and it has its own fan club out there. It's got the people it's working for. You try to take the legs out from underneath the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I think that's not only a problem for Donald Trump and for the Republicans. I think this is something that the American people will say enough. We didn't elect a government once again to try to increase the profits by one tenth of one percent for giant companies, so that they can turn around and step on us. The CFPB shows that government can work for the people because it is working for the people. Let's jump into some questions, and I'm going to start with one that was sent in, that just gets back to the question of what next for the Republican Party. This one asks, we need to come together as a leader, how are you going to make this happen? This is in the context of what now for the Democratic Party, excuse me. I think what coming together means is that we use this government to work for the people, and we do the things that work for the people. Let me put it this way. You look at this election, you say we're a very divided people, and there are issues we are deeply divided on. I understand that. Things where half of America feels one way and half of America feels another. Those are not economic issues. On these core economic issues, how we build a strong middle class going forward, we have a lot of consensus in this country. Let me see how many I can remind everyone of refinancing student loans and bringing down the cost of college. This is something that is deeply supported across America, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, raise the minimum wage, equal pay for equal work, paid family and medical leave. Expand Social Security and Reenan Wall Street. Those are core economic principles that somewhere between two thirds up to three quarters of Americans say, yeah, that's what I'd be behind. That's what's helpful to my family. That's how we build a strong and robust economy going forward. I'll fight for that every single day, and I'll be blunt here. I don't care who gets credit for it. What I care is that those are the kinds of changes we make in this country. We need debt-free college in this country. We need it for the families who are struggling to educate their kids, but we need it for our economy. Has anyone looked at the numbers on this right now? What student loan debt is doing? We have $1.3 trillion in outstanding student loan debt right now, and studies coming out of the Fed, the Department of Treasury, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You know what they show? They show that young people, you do this stuff, age, or just, they're not buying homes at the rate we expected them to. They're not moving out of mom and dad's house. They're not starting small businesses. We're watching depressed entrepreneurship among this age cohort, and what's the number one reason behind that? The number one reason are these student loans. We are saddling our kids with debt, and that means they can't get a start in this economy. They're telling them that they're 100 yards behind the starting line, but the time they get out of college. And it's becoming one more element of how you divide the rich from everyone else. Do you realize that today, 70% of young people who graduate from a public university have to borrow money to make it through? So that what's happening is when I was a kid, my dad was a janitor. My mom worked a minimum wage job at Sears. And yet, how did I go to college? I went to college because I went to a commuter college that cost $50 a semester. That was my chance. That was my debt-free college. And that's how I got to be a public school teacher. And from there, how I ended up going to a public law school and from there becoming a law professor, and from there becoming a United States senator, it was an America of opportunity. And if we don't invest an opportunity, it's not only bad for families and bad for democracy, it's bad for all of us. That's the kind of change we need to make. We've got time for one more question from the audience. Yes, right in the back here, Richard Edelman. Senator, where are you on the sharing economy? And what about benefits for workers who are Uber or other? So, look, we have had what is in effect a contract with our workers. And I use contract now in the big meaning of the word, a big social contract with our workers for generations. Part of it was about what you got paid by your employer and what your employer provided. And part of it was the rest of it. We had social security as the backup. So when you retired, you wouldn't have to be in poverty. Right? We had unemployment insurance for when you got laid out. But it was all built around a model that just doesn't exist anymore. It was built around the model of the single employer that you had for a very long period of time. Now we're moving to people putting together multiple, I'm not sure the word employers write anymore. Multiple income streams in different ways. And what that means is we have to rewrite that contract. We have to rewrite it and we have to rewrite, I believe, the public part, as well as the private part. We can't keep dumping all of the obligations, all the things we want to see us do, build a social safety net on the private side. We're going to have to have a lot more creativity here. And I'll give you just one specific example so it doesn't sound totally generic. And that is independent contractors. The independent contractor laws were written for a very different America. The notion that Uber drivers, for example, cannot come together and bargain collectively to figure out what their terms, working terms and conditions are going to be is crazy. And what that does is it forces them into an economic circumstance that just doesn't exist anymore. It hammers them in to a place that leaves them weakened and unable to get together and negotiate something that's going to work for all of them. Look, here's my last pitch because I know we've got to go. I'm with a bunch of people who run very successful businesses and I applaud that. But for I assume almost everybody in this room, it's really on the premise that everybody needs at least a little chance to succeed. Sure, some are going to do better, some are going to work harder, some are going to catch a break. But that we build opportunity for everyone and that we keep running our systems in ways that those who work hard, who play with the rules are really going to have a chance to build a future. And right now America is not heading in that direction. And this government has not been a government that has helped move it as far in that direction as it should. And I think this is the true challenge in the 21st century. I think it's the challenge for all of you. I think it's the challenge for the Democratic Party. I think it's the challenge for all of America. Senator Warren, if we were any doubt that this is going to be an interesting time in Washington, you've dispelled it for us. So I appreciate it very much. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you.",

Yeah, I had the calling early on, I used to line up my dollies and teach school It was tough being one of my dollies I don't think you did your homework last night, it was tough, it was tough My parents would have given me anything they could but they just didn't have the money to send me to college And the only way I could get to be a teacher is that I ended up at a commuter college that cost $50 a semester And it opened a million doors for me The way I see it, I am the daughter of a maintenance man who ended up as a United States senator Hillary Clinton is the daughter of a factory worker, granddaughter of a factory worker And she's going to be elected president, we believe in that America, that is the America we've brought for We believe but we are worried, worried that those opportunities are slipping away In fact a lot of America is worried, worried and angry, angry that far too often Washington works for those at the top and leaves everyone else behind You know for 30 years now Republicans have pushed trickle down economics And they've done one thing, they've helped the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful And they've stepped on the faces of everyone else who's trying to get a fighting chance to succeed Donald Trump talks a big game about how the game is rigged Let's be clear, Donald Trump is right, the game is rigged It's rigged for guys like Donald Trump And I say it's time to fight back Maggie says it's time to fight back, Hillary says it's time to fight back We start our fight right here on college campuses Education builds opportunities but not if people were getting crushed by student loan debt Right now it's a one-two punch, the high cost of college and the high cost of student loans The federal government is making billions of dollars in profits off the backs of our students It is obscene to make money off people who are trying to get an education But I want to be clear on this, we know where Kelly Aot stands She voted against refinancing your student loans And Donald Trump, we know where he stands too on higher education You know colleges need more money to bring down the cost of tuition His plan is to get rid of all federal student loans abolish the whole department of education I think his plan is to set up another fake university, cut out the middleman and cheat the students directly himself That's why we fight back, that's why we fight back Look, college alone is reason enough to get out and vote It is reason enough to get out and volunteer Hillary and Maggie and I are determined to make debt-free college the law of this land That's where we are We are determined to refinance that $1.3 trillion in student loan debt Yes, help us do that, help elect Hillary and Maggie so that we can make college a pathway of opportunity Not just for rich kids but for all of our kids Yeah Look, we want to build an America that's going to work But that didn't go to happen with Donald Trump Donald Trump cheered on the 2008 financial crash So he could scoop up real estate on the cheat He stiffed small business owners, plumbers and painters and construction workers When he built his casinos and golf courses And Donald Trump disrespects aggressively disrespects Or than half the human beings in this country He thinks that because he has money that he can call women fat pigs and bimbos He thinks because he has a celebrity that he can rate women's bodies from 1 to 10 He thinks that because he has a mouth full of tick-tax That he can force himself on any woman within growing distance Like I news for you Donald Trump, women have had it with guys like you And nasty women have really had it with guys like you Yeah, get this Donald, nasty women are tough Nasty women are smart and nasty women vote And on November 8th, we nasty women are going to march our nasty feet To cast our nasty votes to get you out of our lives forever You know, for more than a year Donald Trump has made headlines almost every day And where has Senator Kelly A. Ott been? Donald Trump, call Latinas rapists and murderers Kelly stuck with him, Trump called African-Americans thugs and Kelly stuck with him Trump attacked a gold star family and Kelly stuck with him Trump compared himself to dictators and praised Vladimir Putin Kelly stuck with him, Trump even attacked Kelly A. Ott and called her weak And Kelly stuck with him You know, during a debate a couple of weeks ago when she called Donald Trump A role model for kids, he just can't believe this But now Donald Trump's not doing so well and Kelly is running as fast as she can away from him Well, I will say one thing Donald Trump sure has made Kelly A. Ott dance Day one, she loves him, day two, she hates him, day three, she's back with him Kelly, spins round and round But one of the things I love about the people from New Hampshire is that you value guts You make the right decision and then you stick with it Donald Trump is right, Kelly is weak And that's why a tough smart fighter like your governor Maggie Hassan is gonna win on November 8th Yeah, I love being here with smart tough women With Hillary, with Maggie, with Carol, with Annie, and with friends of women, Colin You know, just look at Hillary's history She's been on the receiving end of one terrible right wing attack after another for 25 years But she has never backed down She doesn't mind, she doesn't run to Twitter at 3 a.m. to call her opponents Losers or dummies She doesn't even cry that the election is rigged Now, Hillary is the kind who just gets up every day and she keeps on fighting Fighting for children, fighting for women, fighting for families, fighting for healthcare Fighting for human rights, fighting for women, fighting for women Don't worry about us We're with her, we're two things we gotta do First one, we gotta vote New Hampshire has same day registration at your polling location so no excuses anybody Go to iwillvote.com, make a plan now how you're gonna cast your vote And cast your vote for Annie, for Carol, for Colin, for Maggie, and for Hillary You gonna do that?

We believe that no one should work full time and live in poverty And that means raising the minimum wage and we will fight for it We believe that workers should be able to organize for better pay, for better working conditions unions built America's middle class and unions will rebuild America's middle class Yes! We believe that after a lifetime of hard work people are entitled to retire with dignity And that means protecting and expanding social security and we will do it You know, you may have heard, Wells Fargo cheated tens of thousands of people Giant banks brought down our economy Will we believe in tough rules, real accountability and if a CEO breaks the law they have to go to jail just like anyone else Some beliefs are controversial so I want to throw this one out there We believe in science We believe that climate change is real and that we have a moral obligation to protect this earth for our children and our grandchildren and our grandchildren And guess! Boy and I can't believe I have to say this in 2016 We believe in equal pay for equal work and a woman's right to decisions over her own body Yes! We believe that equal means equal and that's true in marriage, it's true in the workplace, it's true for every place And we will fight for equality for all of our people You know, Donald Trump calls African-Americans thugs, he calls Muslims terrorists, he calls Latinos criminals, he brags about sexually assaulting women Well, we believe that racism and sexism and bigotry have no place in our country We believe that black lives matter and that we won't build Donald Trump's stupid wall We believe diversity makes us strong Yes! You do know I can do this all day But we've got a great speaker here, so I'm gonna do one more and then I'm gonna quit We believe that millionaires and billionaires and giant corporations should not be able to buy our elections and our politicians Corporations are not people, we will overturn citizens united and bring democracy back to the people Yes! This is Hillary's agenda, this is Maggie's agenda, this is Colin and Annie and Carol's agenda, it is a progressive agenda, it is a New Hampshire agenda, it is an American agenda Yes! Hillary is ready to fight for us, are you ready to fight for Hillary? And let's welcome to the stage, Hillary Clinton, our next president of the United States Thank you! Thank you! Wow! Well, I don't know about you, but I could listen to Elizabeth go on all day It is so great being here, back in New Hampshire! I have a significant unruly group of women I went to Wellesley with back here Oh, and it's wonderful to be on this college campus and to see so many young people here as Maggie and Elizabeth and I were walking out to the stage, a lot of folks were hanging out of the windows And we're glad that you've got the best view of what we're doing here It's also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifetime And to see the energy and the enthusiasm that this crowd displays, I saw it yesterday in North Carolina, I saw it the day before in Ohio It really does demonstrate that Americans are looking at what's at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved Involved in the remaining days of the campaign and then everyone needs to turn out to vote And here in New Hampshire you have a lot of reasons to vote. You've got great candidates for the Congress, Annie Custer and Carol Shae Porter who deserve your support And you've got a great candidate for governor Colin Van Ostren, thank you I know that Maggie and Elizabeth and I have been out here given the full dose, but I hope you will also make sure people know what's at stake and the governor's race and incending these two extraordinary women to the house And boy, it is exciting to be here with Maggie and Elizabeth because they are people who fight for you every single day I know both of these women and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them Now Elizabeth Warren has a track record of making it her mission to stand up against Wall Street And she's going to make sure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again But you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers, the consumer financial protection bureau And it was set up to stand against and do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse we've seen from Wells Fargo And they are on the front lines of returning billions of dollars to Americans who have been cheated and defrauded by big companies, by banks and others You know, in fact, I think it's fair to say some of the best TV that you can see is on C-SPAN when Elizabeth is going after a bank executive or a regulator She's refusing to let them off the hook and she's not just speaking for herself, is she? She is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up and I am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person working hard here in America I don't know, we're up here without our phones so we can't check tweets but I kind of expect if Donald heard what she just said, he's tweeting away She gets under his thin skin like nobody else She's calling out about his mysterious tax returns She exposes him for what he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States And Maggie is going to be a great United States senator for New Hampshire You know, you don't have to take my word or Elizabeth's word, look at what she's already done under Maggie's leadership New Hampshire has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country During her governorship, it was ranked as the best state in the country for business And she's done it the New Hampshire way She has brought people together, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents I think she has the biggest legislature probably in the world that she has a deal with So she has really honed her skills about listening and then trying to work with people And she's taken on issues that really do keep families up at night From the skyrocketing costs of college and prescription drugs to helping students figure out ways to afford to get their education To helping those suffering from addiction or mental health to raising wages for hardworking families What I love about Maggie is that she's independent, she knows how to find common ground and how to stand her ground And that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the United States Senate Because we've got to break through the gridlock and the dysfunction that has unfortunately Marred Washington, we've got to get back to listening respectfully We can disagree without being disagreeable and that's why we need leaders like Maggie And unlike her opponent, she has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump She knows he shouldn't be a role model for our kids or for anybody else for that matter So I hope in these next 14 days you do everything you can to support her And I want to say a word about Colin, who I've also known for a number of years now And Maggie's leaving some big shoes, she hasn't looked like it, but she is She's leaving some big shoes to fill as governor And Colin is the person for that job, you know, as a member of the executive council, and I remember this because it took a lot of guts He helped lead the fight to protect funding for planned parenthood in New Hampshire Against his opponent, by the way, and he has shown that he will stand up for women's health 100% of the time Not just when it's politically convenient, he also worked with Maggie to cross party lines to help expand Medicaid to more than 50,000 granite stators And Colin wants to do more to invest in clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in New Hampshire And he will protect the beautiful environment of this state and he will fight to put into action the promise of higher education within reach for more families So please, during these next days, make sure you're doing everything you can for Colin, for Carol, and for Annie Now, did anybody see the last debate? You know, I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving once again I have the stamina to be president of that I tried to use the time I had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about starting here in New Hampshire and going across the country Because I take it really seriously I think the problems that keep you up at night that stand in the way of you're getting ahead and staying ahead of providing the best opportunity of a good middle class job with a rising income for you and your kids Those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to, pay attention to, and come up with solutions for So, you know, I do have a lot of plans, I do And I get criticized for having so many plans Tim Cain and I have actually written a book Oh, there's one copy right there It's called, oh, another copy, it's called Stronger Together And we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if we're so honored as to be president and vice president And, you know, I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm here asking for your vote to be your president I should tell you what I'm going to do And maybe as I said yesterday in North Carolina, maybe it is a bit of a woman's thing because we make lists We do, we make lists and we try to write down what we're supposed to do and then cross them off as we go through the day and the week And so, I want you to think about our plans as our lists, our lists as a country We are going to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top We are going to make college affordable, we are going to lower prescription drug costs and we're going to do everything we can to keep faith with what we have said we're going to do What a novel idea, we're actually going to try to deliver results for you But I got to tell you during that debate, Donald said something, well he said a lot of things that were troubling, but he said something truly horrifying He became the first person running for president, Republican or Democrat, who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election Now, that is a direct threat to our democracy I'm not going to try to call it anything else because that's what it is All this talk about the election being rigged, trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies That is a direct threat to our democracy And I got to tell you, as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries And I went to countries where people were jailed for being political opponents, where they were exiled, where they were killed I take this really seriously And for me, the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great Something that... Something we can't lose, something we shouldn't even doubt We cannot give into cynicism And I don't think we are I'll tell you what's exciting to me is across this country At the very moment when Donald Trump is making this unprecedented attack on our fundamental values, our institutions Millions of people are standing up for democracy Registring, volunteering, voting early So when you get a little discouraged, or you get frustrated by what you see in this campaign, think of this We have just reached a historic milestone More than 200 million Americans are now registered to vote And... And most exciting, that includes more than 50 million young people, the biggest number ever Now, you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they believe in And I'm proud to see Americans coming together, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, to reject hate and division And you know, we're seeing that in New Hampshire too We are more than our disagreements, we Americans There is so much more that unites us than divides us I'm proud to have the support of more than 150 Republican leaders in this state who put country before party But this energy we're seeing is not just because of what we're against as important as that is It's because what we're for, it's about fighting for a future where everyone counts Where everyone has a place and no one is left out or left behind Because to me, and I hope to you as well, this is about more than winning an election It's about the kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids That's what this has to be about It's about the lessons we want to pass on to our sons and our daughters You know, we believe we should honor the men and women who fight for our country And that America is safer when we work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence Yet my opponent attacked a grieving Gold Star family who's son died in Iraq He has no plan to defeat ISIS And just last night, he tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote, a total disaster And that our country is, quote, looking so dumb Imagine, imagine, you know, this is a guy who says he knows more about ISIS than the generals I don't think so He's basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started He's proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief It's not only wrong, it's dangerous, and it needs to be repudiated on November the 8th, here in New Hampshire and across America But just in case you think that this is new for Donald It shouldn't surprise you or surprise anybody else, and I'll tell you why He has been denigrating America for decades It started before he ran against me, it started before President Obama took office In fact, back in 1987, he spent $100,000 on an ad in the New York Times criticizing President Reagan He said, and I quote, the world is laughing at America, is that sound familiar? This is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in mocking our country no matter who our president is Now that may be who Donald Trump is, but this election is about who we are And I want us to remember America is great because America is good Right? And as our wonderful first lady, Michelle Obama said right here in New Hampshire, when they go low, we go high This election poses a very clear choice on the economy when the middle class thrives, America thrives As Elizabeth said, she is a perfect example of how that works in America, so am I, so are every one of you here That's what I want for every single person, especially young person in America With your help, we're going to not only have Elizabeth back in the Senate, but Sen Maggie, Sen Carol, Sen Annie, and then make the biggest investment in New jobs since World War II What does that mean? That means jobs and infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our mass transit, our water systems There is a lot of great work to be done here, and guess what? Those are jobs that can't be exported, they've got to be done right here in New Hampshire and across America I want us to invest in advanced manufacturing, and there are, I know a lot of skeptics about that, they say, well we can't compete in manufacturing anymore, well I'll tell you what I don't want us competing with low wage jobs, I want us competing for the high wage jobs Germany is a major exporter of advanced manufacturing products, I want to compete with Germany and countries like that, precision, machining, 3D printing I want us to invest more in technology, innovation, and research, and yes it clean energy because we're going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century I think we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels within the first four years, and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of 10 years That's what I want people to be working on and thinking about and striving to achieve And I am really excited about what we can do to make sure every young American is prepared I want to start in the early years of life, in early education, universal pre-K, I want kids to be prepared to succeed Because we are in a competition, and you know what, I want us to step up and compete and win, and I want our schools, I want kids to have good teachers and good schools in every zip code And I want to be a good partner with our teachers and our educators here in New Hampshire And I want to bring back technical education to high school, I think we really shut the door on too many young people who could have gotten skills that would have given them the chance to get ahead and working with our community colleges We need to make sure that every young person and every person coming back to upgrade or change skills can go to a community college And yes, we are going to make four-year college affordable You know, just this week a new report came out showing that New Hampshire students have very high levels of debt And I know Maggie has been fighting that, and she's had a moratorium and she's done what she could at the state level But we got to work together at the national level to make this happen for students in New Hampshire, families in New Hampshire So after our primary was over, and you know what, I was really proud, I was really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran And it was a campaign about ideas, not insults, and that's what campaign should be about And after it was over, Bernie and I got together, we put our heads together, and we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year And if you make more than that, it will be debt-free. In other words, pay what you can, but let's not have kids and families going into debt to get an education This should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our country's future And no matter where you go to a great school like this or anywhere else, we will help you pay down your student debt We'll make it easier because we're going to make it as a percentage of your income So you're never on the hook for more than you can afford And if you're interested to see how much you and your family could save, you can actually go to Hillary Clinton.com And we'll ask the cash calculator to see how much you can save under this plan that we are proposing Now, I think in addition to growing the economy, we need to do a lot more on small business. Two-thirds of new jobs will come from small business So we're going to be just focused on how we make it possible to start and grow your small business And then we do have to make the economy fair and that starts with raising the national minimum wage Because if you work full-time, I'm talking about full-time workers, you shouldn't still be in poverty at the end Work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb, right? And we are going to guarantee equal pay. We're going to make affordable childcare so nobody pays more than 10% of your income for childcare We're going to work for paid family leave because this is the way families are today You know, we're not living in the 1950s Families are under new stresses and strains and I meet so many who are really just at the edge They're making all they can make one parent work in full-time, two parents work in full-time, sometimes part-time on top of full-time And the other day, Tim Kaine and I were in Pittsburgh And there was a long line of people, a big overflow which you know, we couldn't get into the main room where we were So Tim was talking to the families there and there was a woman holding her three-year-old child, a daughter I think And you know, Tim was shaking hands and the woman looked, she said, she said, I came here hoping I could tell you or Secretary Clinton that I had my baby three years ago And the day after I had my baby, I was fired Because I called and asked if I could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy and my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be I got fired and Tim came in and you know, he's such a wonderful man What a fine, fine human being And he said to me, you know, there are reasons every day why I get so motivated in this election and I just have another reason and he told me that story I think your president should care about that I think your president should wake up every day thinking, okay, how do I help empower people to make the most out of their own lives? You know, how do I knock down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you? And then sometimes people say, well, how are you going to get all this done? And I have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because I see some of my long-time friends who were back in the 92 campaign and you know, when my husband ended up, we had a balanced budget and a surplus And actually, we were on the way to paying down the national debt but here's what happened. What happened is trickle down economics came back So here's what I'm going to do. We're going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share. We're going to close the loopholes. We're going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer. We're going to make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because Elizabeth is absolutely right. No bank is too big to fail and no one should be above the law. So we're going to enforce that and contrast that with Donald Trump. He believes if you give trillions and that's trillions with a T in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires, billionaires in corporations, everything will work out. Well, it will for him. That's trickle down economics on steroids. And he would wipe away the tough new rules that President Obama imposed on Wall Street. He would eliminate the consumer financial protection bureau that Elizabeth did so much to create. And you know, that was bad enough. But then in the debates we learned he hasn't paid any income tax for years. He hasn't paid a penny to support our military, our veterans, pel grants for kids to get an education, health or anything else. And his explanation was well, he lost a billion dollars in a year. Now, I've pondered this. I have really pondered this. He actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes. But how smart are you to lose a billion dollars in a year? And has anybody here ever been to a casino? He lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who does that? I've never heard of anybody. So we've got to make it clear that Donald is not on the side of American workers or American families. You know, for all of his talk about putting America first, he makes his products in at least 12 other countries. He stiffs small businesses, mom and pop contractors who work for him. My dad was a small business owner. He worked really hard. I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump. Because it was hard work. And people who do that work should be rewarded, not taking advantage of. So we know a lot about how Donald Trump works. And today, today we heard yet another story. It's about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses. This maintenance worker told his co-workers he was gay. And they started harassing him. They used anti-gay slurs to his face. They threw rocks and golf balls at him. His supervisor saw it and did nothing. And it got so bad he wound up in the hospital. Finally, he went to the police for help. He couldn't go back to work because he was too scared for his safety. And then he was fired by Trump's golf club. Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence and discrimination that too many LGBT Americans still face every day. And it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors, Trump's golf club turned on the victim for coming forward. If that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does that say about how he would run our country? So, my friends, there are lots of reasons so many to take this election seriously. But here's what I want you to know. Of course, I want you to vote for all of us, but more than that, I want you to vote for yourselves and for your families and for your hope for our future together. Because if you believe women and girls should be treated with dignity and respect, and that women should be able to make our own healthcare decisions, and that marriage equality should be protected, and that we have to take on the epidemic of substance abuse disorders and addiction, if you believe in a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals toward peace and prosperity, then you have to vote. All of these issues are on the ballot this November. And I believe with all my heart that we will, after this election, get together to help heal the divides that have sprung up and are so painful among us. So please register and vote on the same day. Go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place. Come help us these last two weeks. Go to HillaryClinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text Join, J-O-I-N, to 47246, and get everybody you know to come out and vote. I think this election is going to turn on who is motivated to vote. So we need each and every one of you to do everything you can to make it clear to everybody you know that our future is at stake.",

        "transcript": " You Thank you, Missouri. I'm here today with a whole basket full of thank yous. I want to start by saying thank you for sending Claire McCaskill to the United States Senate. Love those tough women. Yes, and I want to say thank you for what you're gonna do and that is Sen Jason Candor to the United States. I'm with Jason. Are you with Jason? All right. So look, it is great to be here in Kansas City. Now I got a lot of reasons to come here. I was born and raised in Oklahoma. It's okay. But I developed a fine appreciation for Kansas City Barbecue. So I'm hoping to eat before I get packed back off to Massachusetts. I also want to say I represent the state that has the basketball Hall of Fame and I want to check out the College of Basketball Hall of Fame. Pretty fabulous. I got to say nicely done. But most of all, I am here because this is a chance to talk about how we build a future for our families. Not just for some of our families, but for all of our families. Yeah, that's what this is about. Jason Candor has spent his career in the Army and the Missouri State Legislature as Secretary of State fighting for working families. That's what he does. He's not just out there to fight for the rich and powerful. Thank you. They're doing just fine on their own. He's out there to fight for everyone else to make sure they've got a real chance in this country. That's why we're here. Now you know, you'll hear a lot of campaign rhetoric. A lot of vague promises, but I'm here because I want a chance to fight side by side with a man like Jason who has the right kind of values. I admit that this is personal for me. When I was growing up, my daddy's sold fencing. He sold carpeting. He ended up as a maintenance man. I had a heart attack when I was 13. My mom answered phones at a minimum wage job at Sears to just try to keep our family above water. Now I have three older brothers and I learned growing up from my older brothers. My oldest brother, Don Reed, was career military, 288 combat missions in Vietnam. Yeah. I learned from him that we honor our promises to our service members and our vets. That's who we are. You bet. My middle brother, John, when he got out of the Air Force, he worked construction and he got a good union job operating a crane. Today he's retired. His knees are shot, but he's got a pension because of that union job. I learned from him. I learned from him that unions built America's middle class and unions well-rebuild America's middle class. Yes. Yes. And my youngest brother, David, when he got out of the Army, he started a small business. And when that one didn't work out, he started another one. And today he's retired and all he's got left is his social security. I learned from him that we honor working people by protecting and expanding social security. I believe him. And me, three big brothers, I was a baby. I was a baby and there was just one thing I wanted in my life, always. I always wanted to be a teacher. Can we hear it for America's public field school teachers? Yes. Look, from the time I was little, all I ever wanted to do was be a teacher. I used to line my dollies up to teach them. It was tough being one of my dollies when I was growing up. It really was. She didn't do your homework. Always on them. My parents would have done anything they could for me. But they had no money. No money for college. So how did I end up as a public school teacher? The answer is I went to a commuter college in Texas that cost $50 a semester. And it opened a million doors for me. And here's what I learned from them. I learned that every kid has a right to an education without getting crushed by student long-difficult. Yes. I made it through and I taught school and eventually I ended up going to law school and I even became a law professor. Who knew? But I learned one more lesson out of that. And that is that I believe that the law should apply equally to everyone. Anyone in here here of Wells Fargo? You know, just today they announced that their profits will exceed $5 billion. Well I believe that no one has a right to cheat people and then walk away. And if CEOs break the law they should be investigated and go to jail. I believe in that America. The America, my brothers, the America I grew up in. But I worry about what's happening in this country today. I believe that that America is at risk. That we live in a world where Washington works great for the rich and the powerful. For everyone else not so much. Wages are under attack. Pensions are under attack. Unions are under attack. Today our very democracy is under attack. Voting rights, civil rights, women's rights, they're all under attack. Look around us. Look around us. Taxes. Keep getting cut for the rich and the powerful. And who paid for it? Infrastructure now in this country is falling apart. Research spending is down a third over 30 years ago. And education, what was supposed to be that great equalizer, those great opportunities. Today the cuts in support for education means someone going to a state school adjusted for inflation will pay 300% of what her mom or dad paid a generation ago. Think about that. And what happens when government regulators run scared and big banks can do whatever they want? Well they build up their profits by cheating people. And in 2008 they brought on the worst crash since the Great Depression. Even today, Wells Fargo thinks that they can cheat their customers, pay a fine and walk away. I'm here to say no more. No more. Jason and I will fight back. That's what we'll do. Now look, I wish that Roy Blunt was part of the solution. But he's not. He's part of the problem. And I want to give you a very specific example on this. My first bill that I ever introduced in the United States Senate was to help students who were getting crushed by student loan debt. Help them refinance that debt. The way you can refinance your mortgage, the way you can refinance a business loan. When the Senate voted on that bill in 2014, there were 5,523,000 people right here in Missouri who would have been able to refinance their loans. Those people, many of you in this audience, could have by now saved hundreds or even thousands of dollars. We brought that bill up for a vote. And every single Democrat, every single independent, and even three Republicans voted to move that bill forward, but not Roy Blunt. Yeah, you think that stinks? Wait till I get to the part about why he didn't vote for it. He didn't vote for it because it would have caused millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit more in taxes to pay for it. For Roy Blunt, it was more important to protect millionaires and billionaires than to help students right here in Missouri. Missouri needs a senator that will stand up for students. It needs Jason Cantor. Yes, that's what we need. Yes. But that's not all. I mean, this is the deal once you're in the United States Senate. People get to look at your record when we voted on a budget resolution to protect and expand social security. Roy Blunt voted no. When we voted to raise the minimum wage, Roy Blunt voted no. And when we voted for equal pay, for equal work, Roy Blunt voted no. Well, you know what I think? I think that when Roy Blunt asks for your vote, the good people of Missouri should vote no on Roy Blunt. Now let's be fair. Roy Blunt doesn't always vote no. When it came to fast tracking, the TPP trade deal, Roy Blunt voted yes. In fact, on this one, his vote is even worse. Roy Blunt supported the TPP, voted for other trade deals that shipped American jobs overseas, and then voted no on legislation to help workers and employers who had been hurt by bad trade deals. And while Blunt votes against raising the minimum wage and helping unemployed workers, he's voted to raise his own pay 12 times in his 20 years in Washington. Look, Missouri needs another senator who will vote for the hardworking people of Missouri, not for Wall Street and Giant corporations. Missouri needs Jason Kander. You know, I really wanted to be here today because I like Jason Kander. I mean, it's just the truth. You know, he is a guy who has literally been in the trenches for this country. He signed up for the National Guard after 9-11. He served as an Army Intelligence Officer in Afghanistan. He trained hundreds of soldiers at Fort Leonard Wood. He knows firsthand that there is no room for partisan bickering in our country. We don't need another leader in Washington who does what's best for himself, his political party, the lobbyists and his donors. Jason believes that a senator should fight for the people, not for giant corporations and armies of lobbyists. Yes. And that's part of the reason that Jason passed the first major ethics reform in the state legislature in 20 years. He has stood up for campaign finance reform so that everyone in Missouri has a voice, not just the lobbyists. Yes. And look, he's done a lot for small businesses. He believes that government should be on the side of small businesses, the folks who don't have an army of lobbyists and lawyers to help them stash their money in the Cayman Islands. And that's why he fought as Secretary of State to cut red tape to give small businesses a break. Exactly the same thing we need to do in the United States Senate. Jason will be a leader. Yep. And Jason fought to help small businesses in Ferguson. That's how you build a future. That's how you build a future. But Jason and I have had a lot of chances to talk about this and it's pretty clear that Jason believes that government should help protect consumers, not turn a blind eye when they get cheated. And that's why he has already worked to return millions of dollars to Missouri families who've been scammed. My kind of guy Jason. My kind of guy. I'll tell you one more that Jason and I have talked about. And that is, Jason and I both believe that the Senate should not ignore its constitutional duty, like waiting 211 days to have a hearing on a Supreme Court nominee. The Senate should do its job. That's right. That's what Jason believes in and it's no surprise that powerful groups are dumping money into Missouri. You know, people like Carl Rove and the Koch brothers, they're spending about $14 million that we know of so far to try to keep their buddy Roy Blunt in power. Now here's how I see this. They may have money and power, but we have our voices and our votes and there's a lot more of us than there is with them. Yeah. Yep. Yes. So Jason and I have two asks today. The first one is vote. Everybody vote. And when I say vote, I mean you vote and you bring your mom to vote and your dad to vote and your grandma and your auntie and your cousin, your eight-year-old. I'm for it. Bring them all to vote. Registered voters only, of course. But vote and help get that vote out. But the second part, it's not enough to vote. We also need you to volunteer. Volunteer. You can make phone calls. You can knock on doors. You can give seniors arrived at the polls. You can help with voter protection. You know, no matter what it is you do, you can help. And this is the underlying here. Democracy is on the line. You know, the rich and the powerful believe that Missouri is for sale. But we believe in democracy and that means we're going to volunteer. We're going to make Jason the winner in this race. That's what it is. So look, ultimately, whatever else we say, this race comes down to our values. And the reason we get together in these rallies is we come here to admit to work. But we come here to remind each other what gets us up in the morning and what keeps us up late at night. It's about what Jason's fighting for, what I'm fighting for, what I believe everybody in this room is fighting for. So let's spend a minute and remind ourselves of what we fight for. We believe in accountability for big banks and when CEOs break the law, then send them to jail just like anyone else. Jason and I will fight for you. You bet. We believe that students ought to be able to get a good education without getting crushed by student loan debt. That means debt free college and we will fight for it. We believe that parents should be able to send their kids to school without fear that their children will not come home alive. And that means common sense background checks. And Jason and I will fight for them. Common sense. We believe that no one in this country should work full time and live in poverty. And that means raising the minimum wage and we will fight for it. Yes. And we believe that every worker has a right to organize for better pay, fair work in conditions and collective bargaining and we will fight for it. We believe that after a lifetime of hard work that seniors are entitled to retire with dignity. And that means protecting and expanding social security and medical. Yes. And we believe that instead of tax breaks for giant corporations that send jobs overseas, we should be investing in education and roads and bridges and research and jobs right here in America. Yes. We will fight for it. You bet. And while we are on the subject, we believe that America should not be signing trade deals that leave workers eating dirt. And that means no TPP. Now I'm going to say something really controversial. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. We believe in science. We believe in science that climate change is real and that we have a moral obligation to protect this earth for our children, our grandchildren and their grandchildren. Yes. We do. I got another one and I got to tell you, I cannot believe that I have to say this in 2016. We believe in equal pay for equal work and a woman's right to decisions over her own body. Yes. Yes. And let's be clear. Donald Trump. This is ugly. Donald Trump calls African-American thugs, Muslims, terrorists, Latinos, criminals and brags about sexually assaulting women. Well, we believe that racism and sexism and bigotry have no place in this country. We believe that Black Lives Matter. We believe in immigration reform. We believe that diversity is what makes this country. Yes. We're the South of Peru. Guys, good to get together. I could do this all day. I really could. I really could, but I'm going to do just one last one, one last one. We believe that millionaires and billionaires and giant corporations should not be allowed to buy our elections and our politicians. Corporations are not people. Overturned citizens united. Return the government to a people. Yes. Yes. Yes. Those are our values and let's be clear. This isn't just a democratic agenda. It's an opportunity agenda. It's an American agenda. Jason is tough. He is smart. He is experienced. And he is going to fight. Fight for his values. Fight for our values. Jason is going to fight for us. Now it's time for us to fight for Jason. Are you ready? Are you ready to fight for Jason? Are you ready to fight for working families? Are you ready to fight for America? Yes. Yes.",

        "transcript": " Well, a lot comes to mind on or not like tonight. But first and foremost is gratitude. Grateful to live in a democratic republic where the people choose our representatives. Grateful to be citizens of the greatest nation in history. And Kentucky, I'm humbled and grateful that you've re-hard me to keep fighting for your families and serving our commonwealth for the next six years. You know, the great Kentucky and my hero, Henry Clay once said, the greatest of all human powers is competition. The competition of ideas is crucial in a free society. My opponent ran a spirited race. He stood up for her views and won a lot of votes. I applaud her willingness to step forward. And I want to thank the team that worked so hard to connect with Kentucky and to make our case. Especially, Josh Holmes, my indispensable advisor on all things political. Kevin Golden, who grew from a young field rep six years ago into running this campaign. And Terry Carmack has been with me since 1984. And he's being my advanced man, mostly meant answering the question, Mitch, who? So most of all, I need to thank my best friend and partner. Elaine is an incredible person in every respect. He's stunningly accomplished as a leader and a public servant. A walking manifestation of the American dream. He's a blessing that I do not deserve, but for which I'm thankful every single day. The people of Kentucky had a clear choice. And they sent a clear message. Tonight, Kentucky said that challenging times need proven leadership. And our nation will need Kentucky values and Kentucky ideas to defeat this virus and regain our footing. The working families in Paduca, the miners in eastern Kentucky and the farmers across our state. The health care workers in northern Kentucky and the teachers in Louisville. The law enforcement officers in Bowling Green and the service members stationed across the Commonwealth. Are all going to continue to have a voice in every important national decision. I'm the only one of the four congressional leaders not from New York or California. I look out for middle America. And I've been sent back to Washington, so the working people in this country. Who make things and grow things and mine things and raise families in our smaller cities and towns. And teach our kids our values. Are going to keep their voice, keep their influence and help our nation come back even stronger. The trust of the people of Kentucky has literally changed my life. When I witnessed Dr. Martin Luther King's March on Washington speech as an intern back in 1963. I dreamed about doing big things to help my state and our country. I never imagined Kentucky's would make me the longest serving senator in our state's history. Or that my fellow Senate Republicans would make me the longest serving Republican leader. In U.S. Senate history. Gather we've used Kentucky's front low seat with the good of our state and of our nation. We've made historic progress in rebuilding a federal judiciary that respects separation of powers. We've confirmed brilliant and qualified men and women who revere our Constitution. We've delivered historic relief and major legislative victories for Kentucky and for all 50 states. We've rebuilt our national defense and deterred our enemies. And in a turbulent time, we have accomplished all this while protecting the Senate's own rules and core traditions. The Senate kept the heat of intense partisanship from damaging our institution forever. The framers far wild held the line. So tonight and Kentucky said we're not finished yet. Kentucky wants more of the policies that built the best economy in modern history. Not socialism that would stifle prosperity and hurt workers. We want to continue rebuilding our military and leading around the world. Not to cut bad deals or just hope our adversaries will ignore us. We want to keep treating China like the threat it is. Not settled for a future where America slides into second class. We're going to keep standing up for the unborn. Not surrendered to an elite coastal culture that says the most vulnerable lives are disposable. So tonight and Kentucky said we're keeping our front row seat in the Senate. We don't yet know which presidential candidate will begin a new term in January. We don't know which party will control the Senate. But some things are certain already. We know grave challenges will remain before us. Challenges that could not care less about our political polarization. We know our next president will need to unite the country, even as we all continue to bring different ideas and commitments to the table. But we also know beyond any shadow of a doubt that our nation, our people can do this for 231 years Americans have dominated one challenge after another. We have everything we need to defeat this terrible virus and come back stronger. We have the most resilient institutions, the most blessed land, and the greatest people in the history of the world. This is no time to attack our constitution like some outdated relic. These are the times it was made for. This is no time to tear down statues of our founders and heroes. This is the time to follow their example. This is no time to declare war on our institutions because one side is angry that the framers made it hard to achieve radical change. This is the time to defend all that we have inherited and pass it on even stronger. When I was a child, our nation was battling a different virus, polio. It was hurting thousands and thousands of families every year. As a very young child, that fight became my own. While my father was all fighting World War II in Europe, I was fighting a different battle. Thank God I had a guardian angel. Her name was Dean and she also happened to be my mother. My mom found our way to warm springs in Georgia. We trekked as a facility over and over more than a hundred miles round trip. My mother took the doctor's advice as gospel. She kept me still when a toddler just wanted to run around, of course. She guided me through exercises I apparently totally hated. And she did it all while checking the mailbox every day for precious letters from my dad from overseas. It's only because of her determination that my first vivid memory by her side in a small store on our way out of warm springs for the last time, buying my first real pair of shoes. About ten years later, American ingenuity had found the vaccine. An American 300 prize was scaling it up. We beat polio here and we have almost defeated it worldwide. So my fellow Americans, our country is going to get back on our feet. Our nation has real challenges and real adversaries, but our fellow citizens are not our enemies. There is no challenge that we cannot overcome together. My fellow Kentuckians, you've given me the honor of a lifetime. I'll always be grateful. I will never let you down. May God bless Kentucky and the United States of America.",

        "transcript": " I'm sorry. Did you take a little time? Hang up, hang up, hang up. Hello? One of the four children's books. Everybody get in here. Good morning, everyone. We just had a rather lengthy as you could tell discussion about the way forward for Senate Republicans. And you have before you the leadership team for the next two years, we collectively, I think, had a good discussion about what happened in the election and what happens in the next election. And I think everybody in our conference agrees we want to give it our best shot to finish the job in Georgia and concentrate on that for the next month. So I'm grateful for the opportunity to continue to serve and to have this outstanding team behind me. And I'd like to call on each of them to say whatever they prefer. Thank you, Leader. I too want to say thanks to my colleagues who are the opportunity to continue to serve as the whip for our conference and congratulate all of our leadership team and our new members, Steve Daines and Shelley Moore Capitol, delighted to have them on the team. And we're looking forward to the task ahead. Well, again, I mentioned this yesterday, but it's really true that we had a narrowly divided country and they've given us a narrowly divided Congress. And the Senate is almost dead even. And the House of Representatives, where we'll have some reinforcements and a majority, hopefully eventually there, will give us a check in balance against the, I think, some of the more radical or reckless policies of this administration. This team up here will be working on the priorities that I think are important, the American people. And that's their economic security, energy security, national security. I think those are the issues that are on the hearts and minds of most Americans. And we will be moving forward with a pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda in this Republican conference and working hard to put the breaks on and stop the spending and government agenda. That is being put forward by the Biden administration and their allies here in the Congress. So I'm looking forward to the work ahead and Ray to lace them up and go to work with this team and with our conference to fight for the priorities that are important to the American people. Well, I also thank my colleagues for their vote of support to continue running the Chairman of the conference. I would point out that while the leader said it was a lengthy meeting, it was also a very helpful meeting, a very productive meeting and a very uniting meeting. And we are clearly united in our efforts to get Herschel Walker elected, the next senator from Georgia, where united in our efforts to hold this administration accountable. And to continue to fight the bad things that they are doing to this country. I want to one thank Joni Ernst for the great job she has done as vice chairman of the conference over the last four years and congratulate you on taking over the policy committee. I welcome Shelly Moore Capito as the new vice chairman of the conference and also Steve Daines, my northern neighbor Montana from Wyoming, who knows how to win tough elections and is the right person to chair the Republican Senate or committee. Great. Well, thank you all so much. I am very excited to be moving forward now with this new team and congratulations to the entire team. I am really thankful to have been able to serve the past four years as the Republican vice chair, the conference vice chair, and very excited about the opportunity now to serve as the Republican policy chair. And I am grateful that Shelly Moore Capito has stepped up, but joined by another woman on our committee and Steve Daines. Thank you for stepping forward to serve as our NRSC chair. So as the RPC, I will be working with all of the members in our conference and presenting different ideas and entailing collaboration. And we heard a lot about that over the past several days. So we want to make sure that all of our voices are heard and their ideas are presented fairly across our conference. So I'm excited about the opportunity to work with each one of our members as we move, of course, into the next election cycle. And I know that the American people will hear our message and it will resonate with them. Thank you. Well, good afternoon now. I'm Shelly Moore Capito, the new vice chair of the Republican conference of the US Senate. Sounds pretty good, I think. I'm very honored to serve with all of our leaders, our leadership here. I would particularly like to say what an honor it will be for me to serve under the leadership of Mitch McConnell, my neighbor in neighboring Kentucky. I have a lot of admiration for his vision and look forward to caring forward with that. The meeting we had was very interesting. It was very respectful sitting in that chamber. It was 50 degrees. I will tell you that. And we listened very attentively to the ideas and the desires of our members. Because after all, we're elected. Our constituency today was in that room, I think there were 48 in the room today with us. So I want to say thank you to my colleagues for inspiring me and instilling me with the confidence. So since I'm the newbie, I should be the one speaking the fewest amount of words. So I will tell all of you. Thank you for what you do in covering us every day. We're going to have a unified message of voice of which I'm going to be participating creating that message. And I look very much forward to seeing all of you again and again and again. Thank you all very much. I certainly was an honor to be selected by my colleagues to chair the NRSC for 2024. I'm honored to be on this stage as well with a couple of my colleagues were all part of that class of 2014, which Joni Ernst and Shelley Moore Capitoves a night when the Republicans picked up nine seats and flipped the majority control to Mitch McConnell. And so I will tell you that it's very important in my highest goal here is ensure that we secure a strong sustainable lasting majority for the Republicans in 2024. And I will tell you we are fired up. We're excited. We're going to hit the ground running and we're going to do everything we can here to fight for every seat. I know. Yes, you were reelected, but this is the first challenge you have faced in 15 years as leader. 10 senators go against you, one voted president. So what lesson did you learn from this? And will you change your approach at all? First, I don't own this job. Anybody who wants to run for it can feel free to do so. And so I'm not in any way offended by having an opponent or having a few votes in opposition. As everyone has said, we had a good opportunity to discuss the various differences. People had a chance to listen to both candidates. And I'm pretty proud of 37 to 10. Mr. Leader, can you respond to former President Trump announcing that he plans to run for re-election? And do you believe that will help or hinder your chances in the Georgia runoff? The way I'm going to go into this presidential primary season is to stay out of it. I don't have a dog in that fight. I think it's going to be a highly contested nomination fight with other candidates entering. And it's all going to be quite good for you all to cover. How do you think it will impact your runoff in Georgia? Do you want former President Trump to come to Georgia? We're going to do everything we can to get Herschel Walker elected. We can't pretty well determine who's going to come in. And we'll see how that develops. Mr. Leader, as Monty said, first challenge of 15 years. Has it made it more or less likely that you might consider stepping aside once you beat Mike Mansfield's record? Look, I'm not going anywhere. So Senator, but we did hear from members that they wanted more inclusiveness that they were some members feel they're being left out of the decisions, the process, the committees aren't working the way they should work. Do you think are you going to make any changes along those lines? Well, no, I think a little differently from the Democrats. We meet three times a week. It's usually Wednesday and Thursday. Have pretty fulsome discussions. And as Senator Cornon ported out in the meeting, any five of us can call a conference to discuss any particular issues. So we acquainted our members with the tools that they have. If they have an idea they want to promote to convene a conference, just five of them for discussion. And I think that'll be used more often. I certainly welcome it. One of the nice things about being in the center is opposed to the house. You don't have so many people. And we're we're together a lot. And there are opportunities all over the place to float new ideas. I've never been opposed to it and won't be going forward. Mr. Speaker, is that the fellow to call that it's not to say that you are not considering any specific changes of some of these members are proposing the 11 who didn't support you. Those are speaking to a state they want specific changes. You're saying you know, we just talked about how we're going to go forward. My question is you're not negotiating any further changes in how you're on the conference. Is that right? We talked about the election. There's nothing to negotiate. We've got a tool to get together often. Yeah. We talked about the election yesterday. Can you talk about what more specifically what lessons were learned and what you might do differently in terms of political strategy any in 2024 or what you might advise the NRSC to do differently heading into 2024? Our problem. And you're talking to the real election over the eight, right? Yeah. Here's the here's the problem. We underperformed among voters who did not like President Biden's performance. In among independents and among moderate Republicans who looked at us and concluded too much chaos too much negativity. And we turned off a lot of these centrist voters, which is why I never predicted a red wave to begin with if you all recall. I said all along this is going to be close. In the poll data we had in the states that we were trying to win, which is the ones we currently had North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri. This was a problem in all of them. It wasn't fatal. In but one of them. And that was Pennsylvania. Dr. Oz was trying to run as a moderate, trying to appeal to those voters in Bucks and Chester County surrounding Philadelphia. That message got muddled at the end, which made it very difficult for him to achieve success. We had the same problem in Nevada, which is our best pickup opportunity. It reflected itself in Georgia as well. But fortunately, I didn't use to like the runoff in Georgia. All of a sudden, I like it a lot better. I used to. We got a second chance in Georgia to get it right. But that was the problem. The base turned out. We had significant Republican base turnout. We have a problem with people in the middle who still, even though they're not as many of them as they used to be, determined the outcome. How do you assess the NRSC's performance under Rick Scott? And will there be changes under Chairman Danes? Yeah, that's up to Steve. I don't intend to assess the performance at all. I think Steve, I don't know if you want to address anything about your plans for the future or not. Well, other than there's been plenty of Monday morning quarterbacks and pundits, we're looking forward. And we're going to learn those be lessons learned certainly from this last cycle. You always learn a lot. And we'll take those lessons learned and apply them going forward. Is there been in your view? I guess the follow up on the earlier question. What's your assessment right now of the health of the Republican Party? Is the party divided? Well, look, I was here in 08. Talk about getting clobbered. There were 40 of us. 40. It took us six years to crawl out of the hole after the 08 election. I'm disappointed in the outcome this year, but 50 is a hell of a lot better than 40. And so it's still a 50-50 country. Given us a 50-50 government again, I think what the public is going to be looking at is whether or not this narrowly divided Congress can accomplish anything that does them any good in terms of their lives. And so my message to the administration and you saw some of it this year. Let's find some things between the 40 art lines that we can agree on and do them. And we did some of that this year, infrastructure, chips, school safety, mental health. We need to make some progress for the American people, but it's going to have to be in the political center. If the House becomes Republican, there's no more one party running over us like they did through reconciliation. No more $1.9 trillion spending, free, plus another 750 in August that sent inflation through the roof. That's over. So my message to the president is, let's talk about doing some things that make progress for the country that we can agree on. Mr. Leader, you mentioned that you have a second chance to get it right in Georgia. What do you think is the quickest lesson that your party can take away from just this past election ahead of that runoff? And I know you don't want to get into the politics and the presidential announcement with Trump, but the timing of the announcement. I've certainly talked to a lot of Republicans here on Capitol Hill that take issue with the timing saying that the focus needs to be on Georgia right now. Do you agree with that sentiment? Yeah, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but I don't have any comments about the timing of that. With regard to Georgia, we underperformed among centrist voters, independents, and moderates in Georgia. We need to try to do better in the runoff. And as I said, all of a sudden I'm a fan of the runoff. We've got another chance to get it right. And that's job one for us. 50 is better than 49 and we're going to give it everything we got. I'm going to take one more. Senator Cruz said that you all had a very vigorous discussion about the debt limit over the last two days. No, we didn't talk about the debt limit. Are you going to seek concessions from the Biden administration in order to raise that up? That's one of the big things we'll be discussing. And once again, as a matter that we'll have to be dealt with on a bipartisan basis, the conditions upon which it's dealt with is something we always discuss. Every time it comes up. Thank you all.",

        "transcript": " Former president Trump did make that pit stop in the Midwest tonight. He just wrapped up his speech in the last 10 minutes or so. He campaigned in Ohio alongside Republican Senate candidate JD Vance, despite not actually being invited. O'Neil's sandwich is here. White House columnist for our partners at the Hill and Nile. I want to jump right in with you. What's your immediate reaction to the former president's speech tonight? Well, there's a lot of red meat here for the Republican base, particularly on topics like immigration and crime. There were some Ohio specific references and JD Vance will be grateful for that. Not a whole lot about a topic like inflation, which is top of mind for so many voters. I would say Republican candidates in general would prefer to run on inflation rather than some of the former presidents false claims about rigged elections and so forth. A very Trumpian speech for good or for bad. He did, we should say, also pick up on that comment that we were talking about earlier in Natasha. The idea that the JD Vance campaign had not invited him to come. He insisted that that was the case. He insisted on rather colorful language that Mr. Vance had been requesting his presence. So there's some contentiousness about that. There is that. And you know, we do see evidence of Republican inviting once again. He did speak about Mitch McConnell two times, I believe. Let's listen to one of them. Mitch McConnell is a disgrace and I hope you're going to do something about it, JD. He's a disgrace. He could have stopped all of it. So Nile, is this good for the Republican party? It certainly isn't. It's not good at all to go to if the biggest figures in the party are longer heads like this. It's no surprise. I mean, Mr. Trump and Senator McConnell don't like each other and haven't really liked each other at any point. I should just say in relation to the former president browned in Senator McConnell a disgrace. I tweeted out an earlier job that Trump had taken up McConnell and a McConnell aid by the name of Scott Jennings. Former McConnell aid, I should say someone who's worked with the Senate Minority Leader in those campaigns. Tweeted back that a group allied with Senator McConnell has committed well over $20 million to be advertising in support of JD Vance's campaign. As far as we know, the former president has not committed any money at all to that effort. But the mere fact that that is being highlighted on social media or anywhere else, I think is demonstrating the fact that there is this civil war really within the GOP and it's not going away any time soon. Yeah, and I think sometimes, sometimes rather, what is not said is what's interesting as well. And I know, Nile, we were talking earlier about whether Trump would mention migrant buses and flights or if that would actually risk highlighting a potential rival in 2024 and to Santis, what did we end up seeing happening there tonight? Well, I guess we were right to highlight that question because he didn't mention the flights or buses at all. Even as he devoted a very considerable period of time to talking about migration, to linking migration with increased crime and so forth, he didn't mention what is the biggest migration-related story in the nation at the moment. And I do think it's a completely fair opposition to suggest that his reticence in that regard is to do with a dislike or distaste for highlighting people who he does see as rivals, particularly Florida and just governor to Santis. I want to talk about the red wave, you know, following the reversal of row this summer, Democrat seeing a swing in their favor, at least according to some polls. And we know that the GOP is pushing crime as a narrative. We saw this tonight leading up to the midterms. Here's actually part of what the former president had to say about that tonight. We are going to make America great again. Our first task is to make America safe again. Right here in Ohio, our once great cities are now scenes of horror, riddled with bullet holes and soaked in blood, you know that. So, now, you know, right off the bat, Trump painting such a bleak picture of our country, is this the winning strategy to re-secure a red wave as Roe v Wade seems to be energizing voters in a way that was initially underestimated? So, traditionally in American politics, that painting, as you say, a bleak picture hasn't been the way to win. Of course, Mr. Trump won with it back in 2016, so that's a pretty important asterisk. But it was interesting to me the way he's trying to create some sort of connective tissue between public concerns about crime, which certainly do exist to his own make America great slogan, really trying to link that into the crime issue as much as possible. As I say, there are definitely legitimate public concerns about crime, but we see, as usual, with Mr. Trump, this rather lured hyperbole. I mean, he says we know that the streets of our major cities are so blood, I think, was the phrase in the clip you just played. You know, do we know that? I mean, we know that there are places where crimes have checked up, but does this very, very elevated feverish way of talking about it help, or does that actually make those independent voters, those voters in the middle grind somewhat diskind what you're actually saying? Yeah, that is the question. Before we go, I do want to talk a bit about the special appointment, or rather the appointment of a special master in the Trump DOG probe, DOJ probe. Here's his reaction to that tonight. America's now they want to say, let's go get this guy. They've been trying for six years, they haven't made it. We're not going to let it happen. So, now, how much would an indictment hurt the former president? He has already said that he would still run regardless. You know, it's a great question. I think there are people with whom it would not hurt him. We think back to the famous comment he made a bit, how he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York and people would still vote for him. As a basic statement, that is true so far as his most firm supporters are concerned, but there are people in the Republican party, not all of the moderates or McConnell type figures, but people who are simply with the former president's populism, but still worry about the amount of baggage he brings. If he were indicted, that baggage would suddenly get a lot heavier. And I think there's no question in that scenario that it would boost the standing or boost the odds of a dissentist type figure as an at Trump-ish choice, with how the chaos and baggage that the former president brings with. Trump-ish choice. All right, Nile Stannich, I appreciate you sticking with us all evening and as always, your insight in the context you provide. Have a great rest of your evening. Thank you.

        "transcript": " As 2022 gets underway, working Americans and their families are facing a steady stream of significant challenges. The fastest growing inflation in almost 40 years. Violent crime rates that continue rise with many of our largest cities setting new all-time records for murders. A southern border that remains in crisis. A new highly contagious variant of the virus that President Biden promised he would personally crush. To few tests and to slow new treatments on this administration's watch. Another rolling wave of school shutdowns, as big labor bosses continue to make hostages out of children's futures over a virus that leads children largely unharmed. But last year, one poll asked Americans about the most important problems facing the country. Some were most worried about the high cost of living. Others said, not surprisingly, the pandemic. One fifth of respondents, the most by far, said the biggest issue was poor leadership. At a time when the Democratic Party controls the entire government. But Mr. Freddon, you know what wasn't on the list of concerns? Wasn't there at all? The fictional, scary stories that liberal activists keep repeating about how democracy is a death's door. Then, November 2020 election had the highs turned out in 120 years. 94% of voters said voting was easy. Only 33% of Americans say it is currently too hard for eligible voters to vote. And a larger number than that actually say, current laws are too loose. Too loose. The American people are not buying this nonsensical talk of Jim Crow 2.0 or a voting rights crisis. Many apart from left-wing activists and the press understands this emperor has no close at all. A few months ago, even voters in Blue New York rejected multiple ballot measures to soften up election laws the way liberal activists prefer. This fake outrage is just a predicate for Washington Democrats to do something they have sought to do literally for years. Write themselves a nationwide board of elections on steroids. This is the takeover that Democrats have sought for multiple years using multiple different justifications. It's not a voting rights bill. It's a sprawling, sweeping takeover of our democracy. Our colleagues and bills would do things like forcing all 50 states, all of them, to legalize corrupt ballot harvests. They'd have the government send public funds directly to political campaigns. The same attorney general who has frivolously sued Texas just to plicate the White House, whose Department of Justice tries to intimidate parents, would be handed new power to Micro Manage Election Law. Some early drafts of this bill tried to literally openly turn the federal election commission into an outright partisan body. Talk about tipping your hand. These changes wouldn't bulls her face in our democracy or in our institutions. It would do exactly the opposite. It would be a civic wrecking ball. And listen, that's before you consider that Senate Democrats wanted to destroy our own institution to ram this through. The current Senate Democratic leader once said that nuking filibuster rules would be a quote, doomsday, or democracy, end quote. Just a few years ago, more than 30 Senate Democrats joined the bipartisan letters supporting the legislative filibuster. President Biden defended the principle in long, passionate speeches throughout his entire career. Just last year, as President, he repeated that destroying the filibuster would quote, throw the entire Congress into chaos. He certainly was right about that. There's no partial or limited nuclear option on the table. As the Senator from West Virginia put it yesterday, whenever you start talking about carving things out, you end up eating the entire turkey. No party that would trash the Senate's legislative traditions can be trusted to seize control over election laws all across America. Nobody who is this desperate to take over our democracy on a one party basis can be allowed to do it. Finally, it is beyond distasteful for some of our colleagues to hamthiscively invoke the January 6th anniversary to advance these aims. Washington Democrats have been trying to seize control over elections for years. Their first draft of the legislation at hand was introduced in January of 2019. The fact that violent criminals broke the law does not entitle Senate Democrats to break the Senate. It is her surreal to hear sitting senators invoke January the 6th to justify, listen to this, to justify breaking rules to grab outcomes they have not earned. I'm going to say that again. It is surreal to hear sitting senators invoke January the 6th to justify breaking the rules to grab outcomes they have not earned. It is surreal to hear sitting senators invoke January the 6th to argue that institutions can be trampled because they like a different result. A year ago the Senate didn't bend and it didn't break. We held strong. It is jaw dropping for colleagues to propose to commemorate that by breaking the Senate themselves in a different way. A year ago there was a lot of talk on this floor about protecting the norms and institutions of our democracy. About putting long term bipartisan traditions ahead of short term partisan power. Someday soon it appears we may learn which of us actually really met it.",

        "transcript": " Well, good morning, everyone. This is a certainly a happy day for the GOP. And let me start by congratulating President Trump, what he's accomplished has not been done, as all of you know, since Grover Cleveland, which was a while back. I also want to commend the Trump campaign for running a sharper operation this time, and I think this was a lot of speed and a lot of credit they ran up to a tax rate raise. So, I'd really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor and majority. I've been the majority, I've been the majority, the majority is a lot better. And I think, based on the fact that we haven't got all the results in, we certainly already know we're going to be in the majority. We're hopeful that that might actually grow some. And I want to give particular credit to Steve James. I had that job that didn't RSC a few years back. I would never seen it a better performance. He focused on getting quality candidates, making sure they actually got the nomination. And as I said, to some criticism, the candidate quality is absolutely essential. So I'm proud of the job that Senate leadership fund and its related groups did. Overall they were able to raise $425 million. And they made decisions to invest in I think all the right places. I'll just run it down for you with this 29 million and Maryland 42 million and Michigan 60 million in Montana. 3.3 million in Nebraska. 12.8 million in Nevada. 133 million in Ohio. 82.7 million in Pennsylvania. 30 million in Wisconsin. And 3 million in West Virginia. So clearly what they were doing over there is focusing on the places where we had the best chance to win. And I think the results pretty much prove they made a lot of wise decisions. So with that, I'll be happy to see what you want to talk about. Senate will talk with me. I'm glad you raised that. I'm really glad you raised that. I should have covered that before. I think one of the most gratifying results of the Senate becoming Republican. The filibuster will stand. There won't be any new states admitted that give a partisan advantage to the other side. And we'll quit beating up the Supreme Court every time we don't like a decision that I make. So I think this shifting to a Republican Senate majority helps have a control the guardrails to keep people who want to change the rules in order to achieve something they think is worthwhile is not successful. And so I think the filibuster is very secure. Yeah. How did you be speaking what is having a 52 or 53 seat majority mean? Again, come to agenda through the Senate compared to a 50 to 51. And does this mean maybe a standing agenda behind the contact theft of extortion or other things? And what are those things? Well, we hear optimistic reports of what may have happened in the house. And obviously, if you were going to legitimately work around the filibuster, it would be through reconciliation. And so I think we'd be obviously more successful if we flip the house and. Speaker, I think could either say me saying he's optimistic. I will pledge the case. In March, you've claimed former President Trump and the President of the List Trump and the Minister are all on the delay to frame a meeting. And is there a left person to ensure or adversary? Yeah, look, I'm here this morning to talk about the election. And I think I'm going to largely confine it to that. Can you talk a little bit about what you expect your role to be next year? When you're not in leadership and you talked about foreign policy, you've got JVBans and the vice president. And obviously that's not working to use from you on foreign policy. What is your view of the next year? Okay, I'm not going to speculate about what anybody else may be doing. I thought your question was what I was going to be doing. I'm going to concentrate on defense and foreign policy. I think this is the most dangerous time since right before World War II. Our adversaries, North Koreans, Chinese Russians, Iran and Iran's proxies are all talking to each other. They have one thing in common. They hate us. And they want to diminish our role in the world. It may seem old-fashioned to some, but I'm still a Reagan Republican. It thinks that America's role in the world is absolutely indispensable. Even if you're concerned about cost, be interesting to know that at the height of World War II, 37% of our gross domestic product was being spent on the war. 37% and we lost over 400,000 Americans. The Reagan buildup without a shot being fired was about 6% of GDP. We're currently spending 2.7%. We need to ramp up defense spending in order to prevent the direct conflict with our adversaries. It's a lot cheaper to prevent war than it is to have one. And so that's the focus I'm going to have for the next couple of years. Would you plan to share the appropriation? I haven't made a decision. I'm hoping this is former leader guzzle and care what I think anyway. And I don't think I'll have anything to do with the committee assignments. Yeah. Are you anticipating any motion to build a crash in the lame duck weeks coming up? Well, we are going to finish, be great how to finish up the year. And that always involves a conversation between Senator Schumer and myself as to how we wrap it up. But those conversations haven't started yet. Just a week before this election, your biography was released. Your biography was released and you put a lot of sharp criticism to the president's front. You stand by this pit of truth. Yeah, I'm not here to do a book review this morning. Yeah. Next week, your colleagues will choose the next majority leader. What should they take away from last night when they go to next year? What can I take from last night? What should your colleagues take from last night when they choose next year? Candidate quality is essential. Absolutely essential. And I think we had the best candidates everywhere. Just for that. You stand the majority leader in this in this situation with narrow majorities in the house and spend it. How challenging do you think it's going to be to keep the Republican party together if you end up with folks before? Well, you're a bit of student history Burgess. The senators became popularly elected in 1914. My party's never had more than 55. Democrats had massive majorities during the 30s during LBJ during Barack Obama. So obviously the higher we get the better, but this is not 60 votes, which is what they had at the beginning of the President Obama. So I think we did pretty well with narrow majorities around the previous administration. Three new Supreme Court justices, 54 new Serfidgetes, comprehensive 30 year-overdute tax reform. Yeah, I mean, it's harder, but I think we were successful before with a narrow majority. And I think we will be again. I'm never looking at the results from last night. What do you take away from the new to the country where it is now, where it is headed, and how it land according to your expectations? Well, if you're looking for a simple answer, I think it was a referendum on the current administration in part. I think we were just not happy with this administration and the Democratic nominee. Obviously it was a part of it. In your role as former leader, do you think your level of danger is going to be directly with the new Trump administration? Again, giving your criticism to the former president. I'm going to do everything I can to help with the administration be successful. Would you be in support of UNUS and RKP, having positions in the cabinet for that position? I'm sorry, you said it again. Would you be in support of RKP's tenure, any UNUS, having positions in the cabinet for different cabinet? Is there any that UNUS, having the opportunity to have this value of your views and RKP's views for that role? I know there are other things about advancing age. If you all live as long as I do, you're going to have a hearing age on and have a hard time hearing a question like that. Why don't you come up here? I'm going to get into that subject. Anything else related to what happened yesterday? I'm going to present some of what happened yesterday and some of what it has in the base administration. I think that the relationship will be smoother at times. What advice would you have to have the confidence of your own with the new majority of Americans at all? I had a lot of dealings with them during the previous administration. I think we did a lot for the American people. Can you expect any flashes with President Trump over nominees in case he goes more towards their economic, popularist growth? I think it's way too early to tell who the nominees are going to be and I think the Senate will treat them fairly. I'll aim duck question. Some of the times I have a lot of judges in the channel here that they could try to push through in these last few weeks. What do you think Republicans should do if that's the way I am? I wonder if you manage to be in the majority of you get to decide what to bring up and I think that's what the majority of you want to do. That's what we'll do and each one will be voted on. I think Republicans have the show of the Senate and the presidency. How do you expect to bring up priorities like appropriations to the panel? Is that going to be funded in the next year? I don't expect one. Appropriations and other big linked up priorities? Well, I think getting our work done, which no matter who's been in the majority, we've not been able to do that very well for quite a while. Deciding how to spend the discretionary money that we have, which is not a very big part of what we spend every year anymore, is really important. And I would hope we would put a greater priority than the current Senate has on doing the basic work of government, which is getting it deciding how much to spend. And getting it done is close to regular orders possible. I was hoping you could come here in 2017 and tax-effective jobs at extension that Republicans are pursuing now to the Bush tax extension that we saw. Are these comparable periods in policy damage and what are the Republican positions to use in that? I can speak for most Senate Republicans. We thought it was a huge success. It produced more revenue than less. And I'm sure virtually all of us would like to see most of that extended. Okay, I think we're through. Good luck to you all. I enjoyed talking to you and it was a hell of a good day. Thanks a lot. I just hope you enjoyed it.",

        "transcript": " New polling reveals that nearly six and ten Republican voters or 58 percent would vote to put former President Donald Trump back on the ballot in 2024, making him the clear favorite to win the GOP nomination. Other Republicans with support included former Vice President Mike Pence, who came in at 13 percent, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who pulled at 9 percent. Democratic strategist Jennifer Hall's worth carp and White House reporter for Real Clear Politics, Philip Webman joined us to discuss Trump's backing. Hey guys, welcome back. So Jennifer, let me pose this to you. Is it all but certain that Trump is going to get the nomination and he's going to be the one on the ballot for Republicans? Sure. If he runs, he'll win. I think that he's still dipping his toe into whatever he dips his toe into. He hasn't made any definitive statements, but if he runs, barring some catastrophe, he will absolutely win the nomination. The no one has rested control of the Republican body politic away from him. And so Philip, he's also been organizing against Mitch McConnell trying to rally support to depose him as a leader of the Republican caucus in the Senate, Republican conference and Senate. That doesn't seem to be going as well for him as these primary polls. What's the difference? Why is he running up against the wall in the Senate there? Because Mitch McConnell is someone who knows the rule book of the Senate. His caucus knows that he does and he has guided Republicans through a number of difficult challenges. It's really interesting because at the same time that Donald Trump has put his image on the Republican party, Mitch McConnell has gone from someone who is reviled by the right. I think a lot of people forget about this. But it was Cruz and Rand Paul and others who were having friction with him. There were others like Jim Dement were constantly saying that Mitch McConnell during the Obama years was not doing enough to limit spending. He was not doing enough to push back against the Obama administration. And a lot of conservatives that they just didn't like the guy. That's changed though. Now he's turned to this sort of folk hero, this cocaine-missed sort of guy. Because he guided Republicans through three Supreme Court confirmations because he got Republicans their tax cuts. I think that is going to be difficult for Trump to oppose McConnell for seriousness. One, he knows the rule book and he showed up for his members and he's really good at holding on the power. And two, you see a lot of conservatives who are saying, what are you talking about? Why do you want to get rid of Mitch McConnell? He delivered all the things that you're bragging about right now. He's the one who got it to the finish line. So it's easy to get some good poll numbers in a poll based on the name ID, but actually turning around and knocking someone like Mitch McConnell would be a lot more difficult. No, and that's what drives me crazy is. I mean, some of the biggest accomplishments that we touted in the Trump administration were pretty much due to McConnell's leadership, whether it was the USMCA tax cuts and, of course, getting three Supreme Court justices on the bench, as well as just that we would brag about the 200 plus lower court judges that we were able to confirm. That was because Mitch McConnell knows how to work the Senate. He knows how to wrangle those votes, twist arms and get things done. It is funny though, like Philip, you make a good point. There's just nothing new under the sun. This reminds me of the, you know, fire John Boehner efforts, the ditch Mitch in the past. It just doesn't seem like it's going to get any legs though. You couldn't find a single Republican Senator sitting or running who got on board with this effort, but what I will be watching for is some of the very Trumpian candidates, the Eric Grytens and Missouri and others, if they might try to get on board with this effort. What do you think? Yeah, that's really a point. I think that some of the newcomers who haven't been there for some of these fights who have been in the trenches of, you know, the Senate office buildings are going to say, well, we don't need Mitch McConnell. Instead, we need someone to be, you know, just aggressive to fight constantly. I think about Mitch McConnell is that I'm pretty certain that the man doesn't do anything, whether it's, you know, walking out to get the paper or pouring himself a cup of coffee, unless he's thought of all the different contingencies and all of the different possibilities of how that could go wrong or how that could go right. And I think that, you know, if you look at it right, it's recurrently Ted Cruz and Miss McConnell are on the same page. That was not always the case. There was a time when Ted Cruz was wearing against McConnell, saying that he wasn't doing enough, you know, to repeal Obamacare, that he wasn't getting aggressive enough, so on and so forth. But right now, you see a lot of the rebel rosters on the right, whether it's Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, their interests are aligned with McConnell's. Because basically, McConnell has said, you know, we're going to pose the president's agenda, and that's something that conservatives sort of my are in favor for. So that's why I don't think that we, this is why I've not seen this sort of inner partisan warfare here, because, you know, they're aligned. And I think that, you know, a lot of these, a lot of these conservatives are saying to themselves, you know, why do I, why do I want to fight another Republican? It's already a target rich environment. I can complain about the left's, going to Fox News, fundraise, keep my seat. Why, why I think I'm not necessarily fighting? Well, Jennifer, that view of McConnell as this strategic genius is widely, you know, held in the Senate, and it's propagated by McConnell and his allies quite generously. But, you know, coming into the Georgia, the Georgia runoffs, McConnell decided that his smartest move ahead of those elections was to block the $2,000 checks that Donald Trump was calling for. Had he not done that, he probably is Senate majority leader right now. So how do we square this, his reputation for, for tactical brilliance with the, a tactical blunder that not only cost the, the cost him the majority, but then is, you know, could quite possibly lead to rolling back a lot of the tax cuts that he got, that he got through in 2017. Right. I mean, look, I had, had posited for the last four or five years that Mitch McConnell was just as dangerous as Donald Trump for the left. And if Donald Trump took out his own greatest offensive weapon, that would be fine by me. I think that he would get a fraction of what he got accomplished the last time accomplished if he were to win another term. But this was a, a weird conscience thing from McConnell that I have never seen an experience before and it was actually uncomfortable to watch him experience it. Normally, he's at his best when he has, you know, no thought for what's not going to serve him and his caucus. But I think that he was already preparing to give that speech about the election integrity and he was looking to be credible on that speech. So he was already trying to divorce himself from Donald Trump so that he could see credible when he gave that election integrity speech. It obviously did not serve him personally, which is why it was so uncomfortable to watch. Obviously, I appreciate it. But this is somebody who's been a danger for years to democratic ideals and goals. You know, we forget before Donald Trump was in office filling all of those seats that Mitch McConnell stole a Supreme Court seat before Donald Trump was ever a thing. Right? So this is his danger to democracy and his danger to the goals of the Democratic Party has existed for decades. I think people are, you know, sort of warmed to him when he was giving the election integrity speech and credit where credit is due. I am glad that he did. I am glad that he listened to his better angels and did so. But he quickly reverted into his previous psyche, which was to just win, maybe win at all costs, regardless of what it means to the Senate or American democracy. So I don't think we will see much, much daylight between what a potential candidate Donald Trump will say and what a minority leader Mitch McConnell will say. But at the risk of celebrating shot and fry too early, I think it would be hilarious if Donald Trump actually was successful in taking him out and it would serve him right. Well if I would be or misafied in defense, cocaine, Mitch, real quick on the $2,000 payments, the justification was that we had 10 million people unemployed, but then we had more job openings than that. And the thought was that if we continue to give people aid that they're not working and they're receiving it at home, that they're going to be disincentivized to get back in the workforce. And I would mention, I don't think that's what lost this Georgia. I was advising the Georgia Senate races. I think it was that the former president, the still then president was telling people, your vote doesn't count. It was stolen and it depressed voter turnout because of course it did. And we lost two Senate seats because of it. And also they were both crooks, but fill up Jennifer. Thank you so much for joining us. Thanks for having me. And we will have more rising after this.",

        "transcript": " Well, good morning, everyone. This is a certainly a happy day for the GOP, and let me start by congratulating President Trump, what he's accomplished. It's not been done, as all of you know, since Grover Cleveland, which was a while back. I also want to commend the Trump campaign for running a sharper operation this time, and I think this lost the beta, and season-gwiles deserve a lot of credit. They ran a spectacular race. With regard to the Senate, you guys know how long I've been right. I had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successors, the majority. I've been to the majority, I've been to the majority, the majority is a lot better. And I think, based on the fact that we haven't got all the results in, we certainly already know we're going to be in the majority, we're hopeful that that might actually grow some. And I want to give particular credit to Steve Taines. I had that job within RSC a few years back. I've never seen a better performance. He focused on getting quality candidates, making sure they actually got the nomination. As I said, to some criticism, the candidate quality is absolutely essential. Also, I'm proud of the job that Senate leadership fund and its related groups did. Overall, they were able to raise $425 million, and they made decisions to invest in, I think, all the right places. I'll just run it down for you. I think they spent $29 million in Maryland, $42 million in Michigan, $60 million in Montana, $3.3 million in Nebraska, $12.8 million in Nevada, $133 million in Ohio, $82.7 million in Pennsylvania, $30 million in Wisconsin, $3 million in West Virginia. So clearly, what they were doing over there is focusing on the places where we had the best chance to win. And I think the results pretty much proved they made a lot of wise decisions. So with that, I'll be happy to see what you want to talk about. You know, I'm glad you raised that. What would you do outside of the leadership now to continue to advocate on that? Is there a force to do that? I'm really glad you raised that. I should have covered that before. I think one of the most gratifying results of the Senate becoming Republican. The filibuster will stand. There won't be any new states admitted that give a partisan advantage to the other side. And we'll quit beating up the Supreme Court every time we don't like a decision they make. So I think this shifting to Republican Senate majority helps have a control of the guardrails to keep people who want to change the rules in order to achieve something they think is worthwhile is not successful. And so I think the filibuster is very secure. You know, we're particularly speaking what is having a 52 or 53 seat majority being again comes agenda through the Senate compared to a 50 to 51 seat. And does this mean maybe it's been agenda nine to come back steps of explore other things and what like those things do? Well, we hear optimistic reports of what may have happened in the house. And obviously if you were going to legitimately work around the filibuster, it would be through reconciliation. And so I think we'd be obviously more successful if we flip the house and speaker, I think put out a statement saying he's optimistic. So that's the case. In March, you claimed former President Trump and the President and the Minister are all on the delay to the Senate. Are you confident that you would reject for a second to do so or adversary? Yeah, look, I'm here this morning to talk about the election. And I think I'm going to largely confine it to that. Yeah, I'm not going to speculate about what anybody else may be doing. I thought your question is what I was going to be doing. I'm going to concentrate on defense and foreign policy. I think this is the most dangerous time since right before World War II. Our adversaries, North Koreans, Chinese Russians, Iran and Iran's proxies are all talking to each other. They have one thing in common. They hate us. And they want to diminish our role in the world. It may seem old-fashioned to some, but I'm still a Reagan Republican. It thinks that America's role in the world is absolutely indispensable. Even if you're concerned about cost, be interesting to know that the height of World War II is 37% of our gross domestic product was being spent on the war. 37% and we lost over 400,000 Americans. The Reagan buildup without a shot being card was about 6% of GDP. We're currently spending 2.7%. We need to ramp up defense spending in order to prevent a direct conflict with our adversaries. It's a lot cheaper to prevent war and it is to have one. And so that's the focus I'm going to have for the next couple of years. So, Peter and the panel, will you plan to share the appropriation? I haven't made a decision. I'm hoping this is former leader guzzled care what I think anyway. And I don't think I have anything to do with the committee assignments. Are you anticipating any motion to Democrats and the lame duck weeks coming up? Well, we are going to finish, figure out how to finish up the year. And that always involves a conversation between Senator Schumer and myself as to how we wrap it up that those conversations haven't started yet. Just a week before this election, your biography was released. Your biography was released and added into a lot of short criticism. Yeah, I'm not here to do a book review this morning. Next week, your colleagues will choose the next majority leader. What should it take away from last night when they vote for the next election? What can I take from last night? What should your colleagues take from last night when they choose next? Candidate quality is essential. Absolutely essential. I think we had the best candidates everywhere. Just right. You spend the majority of the day in this, in this situation with narrow majorities in the house and Senate. How challenging do you think it's going to be if you or public parties together, if you end up with folks and folks? Well, you're a bit of a student of history, Burgess. Since senators became popularly elected in 1914, my parties never had more than 55. Democrats had massive majorities during the 30s, during LBJ, during Barack Obama. Obviously, the higher we get the better, but this is not 60 votes, which is what they had at the beginning of the President Obama. I think we did pretty well with narrow majorities around the previous administration. Three new Supreme Court justices, 54 new Circuit judges, comprehensive, 30 year-overdue tax reform. Yeah, I mean, it's harder, but I think we were successful before with narrow majority, and I think we will be again. Senator, looking at the results from last night, what do you take away from the new to the country where it is now, where it is headed, and how it land, according your expectations? Well, if you're looking for a simple answer, I think it was a referendum on the current administration in part. People were just not happy with this administration, and the Democratic nominee obviously was a part of it. In your role as former leader, when you think your level of engagement is going to be directly with the Trump administration, again, giving your criticism from the president? I'm going to do everything I can to help the administration be successful. Thank you. I'm sorry, say that again. One of the things about advancing age, if you all live as long as I do, you're going to have a hearing aids on and have a hard time hearing a question like that. Would you be in support of Elon Musk and our page unit having a position to send that Elon Musk as an important being contact? Yeah, I'm not going to get into that subject. Anything else related to what happened yesterday? I had a lot of dealings with him during the previous administration. I think we did a lot for the American people. Do you expect any flashes with President Trump over nominees in case he goes more towards economic, popular as well? I think it's a way too early to tell who the nominees are going to be, and I think the Senate will treat them fairly. I think it's a lame duck question. Some of the kinds that a lot of judges in the channel here that they can try and push through in these last few weeks, what do you think Republicans should do? I think one advantage being the majority of the people you get to decide what to bring up. I think that's what the majority of you want to do. That's what we'll do and each one of the voters don't. Republicans have the role to send in the presidency. How do you expect a lame duck question? I think getting our work done, no matter who's been in the majority, we've not been able to do that very well for quite a while. Deciding how to spend the discretionary money that we have, which is not a very big part of what we spend every year anymore, is really important. I would hope we would put a greater priority than the current Senate has on doing the basic work of government, which is deciding how much to spend and getting it done is close to regular orders possible. I was hoping it would come to be 2017 and the tax-pressing jobs act extension that Republicans are pursuing now to the Bush tax-press extension. I think it's comparable to the policy line and what is the reform of the position you can use that? Well, I can speak for most Senate Republicans. We thought it was a huge success. It produced more revenue than less. I'm sure virtually all of us would like to see most of that extended. I think we're through. Good luck to you all. I enjoyed talking to you and it was a hell of a good day. Thanks a lot. Thank you.",

So thank the people of the Hampshire for a great victory tonight. And let me thank the thousands of volunteers in the Hampshire. Thank you. Who knocked on doors in the rain and the snow and the cold. The reason that we won tonight in the Hampshire we won last week in Iowa. It's because of the hard work of so many volunteers. And let me say tonight that this victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump. With victories behind us, popular vote in Iowa and the victory here tonight. We're going to Nevada. We're going to South Carolina. We're going to win those states as well. And tonight I want to take the opportunity to express my appreciation and respect for all of the Democratic candidates. We ran against. Amy Clovichar, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden. And what I can tell you with absolute certainty and I know I speak for every one of the Democratic candidates is that no matter who wins and we certainly hope it's going to be us. We are going to unite together. We are going to unite together and defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. And the reason I believe we are going to win is that we have an unprecedented grassroots movement from coast to coast of millions of people. The reason that we are going to win is that we are putting together an unprecedented multigenerational, multiracial political movement. And this is a movement from coast to coast which is demanding that we finally have an economy and a government that works for all of us not wealthy campaign contributors. And I want to thank all of those people who have worked and contributed to our campaign but make the point that in this point in the campaign we are taking on billionaires and we're taking on candidates funded by billionaires. But we are going to win because we have the agenda that speaks to the needs of working people throughout this country. Health care is a human right not a privilege. The wealthy and powerful will start paying their fair share of taxes. We will make public colleges and universities to wish it free and cancel all student debt. Unlike Donald Trump, we know that climate change is very real and an existential crisis for our planet. We are prepared to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short term profits are not more important than the future of our planet. We are going to end a racist and broken criminal justice system. We are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform. We are going to have a lot of gun safety policies determined by the American people not the NRA. And under our administration it will be women not the government who control their own lives. Our campaign is not just about beating Trump, it is about transforming this country. It is about having the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military industrial complex. So tonight I want to thank the people of the Hampshire for this great victory, thank our volunteers and urge all Americans to join our effort to transform this country at BernieSandis.com. It is on to Nevada, it is on to South Carolina, it is on to win the democratic nomination and together. Together I have no doubt that we will defeat Donald Trump. Thank you all very much.

        "transcript": " with the Saudis in butchering and bombing civilians in Yemen. Bernie Sanders led the effort to pass the war power's resolution to stop the war in Yemen. The first time a war power's resolution has passed in the history of the United States. There are a lot of candidates who talk about the working class and middle class. But Bernie Sanders is the only one who is actually delivered. He stood up. He stood up to Jeff Bezos from the minority in the Senate to get 350,000 workers a raise to $15 an hour. And when Bernie Sanders is president, we will have health care as a human right, which means Medicare for all. Now let me tell you before I bring on the next speaker and before you get to hear from Bernie Sanders himself, something that I always push back on and I hope you will too. The media does not understand Bernie Sanders when they describe this campaign as a campaign of anger or a campaign of frustration. This is not a campaign of anger. This is a campaign of vision. This is a campaign of inspiration. This is a campaign of redeeming the promise of this country, a country that believes that we don't need to be insenseless wars, that we don't need division based on race or gender, that we can have a nation where we want value and honor the dignity of every single human being. My friends, that is what we believe here in San Jose. That is what we believe here in California. That is the spirit that is guiding Bernie Sanders and that is the America we are fighting for to elect Bernie Sanders, the next president of the United States. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome James Sanders! Hello San Jose, thank you for coming out to the beautiful day to be here. I'm not going to talk about Bernie very much because everybody else has done such a great job and Ben will as well. I wanted to just mention, just to pick up on what Rose said, what he is running for is to improve the quality of life, the daily existence of the people of this country, not those just on top, but the rest of us. I have the honor today of introducing somebody that I've admired for many, many years. He is known to you as the co-founder of a very wonderful ice cream company, Ben and Jerry's. But Ben is more than just Ben and Jerry's. He has shown that you can be an entrepreneur, a corporate citizen that takes care of what is right environmentally, what is respectful, agriculturally, and what is wonderful in terms of being a company where workers enjoy their work or respected. He is a very respected and they are incredibly successful. So without further ado, let me introduce Ben Cohen, our co-chair! He is also co-chair of the Bernie 2020 campaign. Hello, San Jose, you are looking good, you are looking very good today. Thank you so much for coming out. Before Bernie, I used to be the most famous guy from Vermont. So it is with pride and joy that I give up that mantle to Bernie. Ice cream is good, but a president of the United States who truly believes in justice in all its flavors, that is you for it! I am here today because I have been Bernie's constituent for 40 years. And I can tell you that this guy is the real deal. Bernie has inspired me, inspired me because I have seen him in action. You can believe what he says, but more than that, he does what he says. Yes, he has a vision, but he also has tenacity. Bernie makes things happen that people thought could never happen. I have watched him all these years and I finally figured out what makes him tick. It is love and caring. And he shows that love and caring in the work that he does. Bernie is not a politician in the usual sense of the word. He is a fighter for justice, economic, social, racial and environmental. And he uses politics as a means to that end. You know, in 1981, when Bernie was first elected mayor of my city, I saw him transform it from a city that was being run for the benefit of business interests. And instead, is now run for the benefit of regular everyday people and those who are oppressed. He fought hard to do it. The old guard was trying to stop him every step of the way. He persevered and he won. And he transformed the city of Burlington into a model of a great quality of life. His first act as mayor was to shut down plans to privatize the shore of Lake Champlain with expensive condominiums. And instead, he turned the land into a park that was open to everybody. When he became my congressman, he personally took busloads of women who were struggling with breast cancer over the border into Canada where they could buy the prescription drugs they needed for one-tenth the price of what they were forced to pay here in the U.S. He said a precedent and congressmen after congressmen did the same thing and take their busloads over. He voted against NAFTA before being against NAFTA was cool. He voted against going to war in Iraq twice. Then in 2007, he defeated the richest man in Vermont and became my senator. As senator, he worked with conservatives to force the first-ever audit of the Federal Reserve Bank that revealed numerous conflicts of interest and trillions of dollars in ultra-low interest loans to Wall Street banks. Then the Republicans were trying to push through legislation that would have cut Social Security benefits and benefits to veterans. Bernie led the successful opposition to that. Next week, Bernie will be making a demand of the Walmart Board of Directors to bring the minimum wage up to $15 an hour. Now, Bernie is working in the Senate leading the charge against going to war in Iran. Bernie understands that wars do not solve problems. They create more problems. All in all, Bernie has been in Congress and the Senate for 30 years. It is that experience in the trenches, in the cesspool of what is our political system today that will enable him with the help of all of us to finally flush the crap down the drain. So, when Bernie ran for president the first time and said that he wouldn't take any big money donations, I thought it was a mistake that he would never be able to run enough money to mount a credible campaign. Then I came to understand what was going through his mind. He realized that if he couldn't put together an army of millions of people that were willing to donate small amounts of money, that once he got elected, he wouldn't have that army of people that he needs to push through the legislation that he wants to make happen. So, what do I think about Bernie, the man? Well, he's always been the same. He never waivers. He has a clear vision for how to make America kind again. He's not a fancy guy. He's pretty down-home. No airs. And I like his hairstyle. That never changes either. Bernie doesn't go with the trends. He sets the trends. Small, donor-funded campaigns. Universal healthcare. Free public colleges and universities. Just look at all the other candidates that are following him. Look, this campaign this year is an historic opportunity. Finally, we have a chance to elect a president who is not selected by insider power brokers, but for the first time in my life, a true candidate of the people. Finally, a candidate who instead of being financed by Wall Street, the pharmaceutical companies and the chemical industry, is ready to go to bat for us against them to rein them in. I know the most important thing is defeating Trump. That's the way I feel. That's the way Bernie feels. That's the way I'm sure we all feel. And polls have shown consistently time after time that if nominated, Bernie beats Trump. Bernie beats Trump. Thank you. Thank you for your participation. So we have a choice to vote in the primary for Bernie who will beat Trump and transform a rig system or vote for one of the other guys or girls and get more of the same old same old. And when he's elected and I become the minister of ice cream, I promise a pint in every freezer, a Sunday in every bowl. Power to the people. Power to the people. What? Oh, I'm done. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, the most amazing fighter for justice that I've ever seen. Senator Bernie Sanders. Sounds. It sounds like you all are ready for a political revolution. Let me thank the thrive choir. Kelsey Prestel, winner Walker Baker, Jr. Samina Usman, Dr. Cornell West, Danny Glover. And the future minister of ice cream, Ben Conn. And your congressman, Rokana, who's going a great job in the United States Congress. I want to welcome you all to a campaign, which is not only going to win here in California, which is not only going to win the Democratic nomination, which is not only going to defeat the most dangerous president. But with your help is going to transform this country and create an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the 1%. And the message of our campaign is us, not me. And the reason for that is that we have got to change the culture of America. I have got four kids and seven grandchildren, and I want you to be concerned about my family. I, in turn, will be concerned about your families. And that is what a civilized democratic society is about. We are in it together. Us.me. And the second part of what us, not me, is about, is me telling you now a truth that you're not going to see much about on TV. And very few candidates for anything will tell you. And that is that we can elect a president who is honest and well-intentioned. But still not able to bring about the changes that we need in this country. And I will tell you why. It's not because he or she won't try. It's because we have a power structure in this country of incredibly powerful people and institutions who exert unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of America. And we don't bring the change that we need unless we have the guts to stand up to those powerful special interests. And so when we get elected and we together are in the White House, we will tell Wall Street we're going to end their greed. We are going to tell the insurance companies we are going to end their greed. We are going to tell the pharmaceutical industry we're going to end their greed. We are going to tell the prison industrial complex we're going to end their greed. We are going to tell the military industrial complex we're going to end their greed. And last but certainly not least we are going to tell the fossil fuel industry they will not destroy this planet. I want to welcome you to a campaign which is based on love which is based on compassion which is based on justice. It is a campaign and a future government that will end what Trump is doing in terms of his racism in terms of his sexism in terms of his homophobia in terms of his religious bigotry. We are going to win this election because our campaign is about bringing people together not dividing them up. Our campaign is about justice and I mean by that economic justice, I mean by that social justice, I mean by that racial justice and environmental justice. I get around the country a bit and I am here to tell you that the working class of this country is sick and tired of working two or three jobs and seeing almost all of the new income in wealth going to the top one percent. American people are tired of seeing 500,000 people who are homeless in this country. In San Francisco is San Jose and in Burlington for a month. The American people are sick and tired of having to pay 40, 50, 60 percent of their limited incomes in housing. The American people are tired of leaving college with enormous debts that will take them decades to pay off. The American people are tired of trade agreements that shut down profitable companies in America and go to low wage countries abroad. So what we are fighting for is a government and an economy that represents the needs of the American people. So today we say to the private insurance companies that whether they like it or not, the United States will join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a world. Now the drug companies and the insurance companies will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to maintain the current dysfunctional health care system. This is a system that makes billions of dollars in profit for the insurance companies, while 34 million Americans have no health insurance and many of you are underinsured with high deductibles and high copayments. We believe in a health care system which allows any person in this country to go to the doctor whenever they need to go to the doctor. We believe in a health care system which says that after you leave the hospital you don't have to worry about your family going bankrupt. Health care is a human right and we are going to bring that right together to the American people. And when we talk about health care we are going to end big time the outrageous greed of the drug companies. Last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit. Got that? And you know why they make so much money? Because they charge us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. In fact, they charge us any price they want and one out of five Americans today. People who are sick, people who go to the doctor and get a prescription cannot afford to fill that prescription. Brothers and sisters, that is insane. We are going to end it. We are going to cut drug prices in half in this country. This is the wealthiest country in the world and we should not have half of our people living paycheck to paycheck. I know a little about paycheck to paycheck because that is the family that I grew up in. And what it means is if your car breaks down today and you need 500 bucks to get it fixed and you don't have that 500 bucks you can't get to work. And if you can't get to work, you get fired. And if you get fired, you can't feed your kids. And all over this country, people are scared to death living under enormous anxiety that maybe their kid will get sick. Maybe they'll end up in the hospital and they have no idea in the world how they're going to pay those bills. So what we say today, that in America, if you work 40 hours a week, you will not live in poverty. We are going to raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage at least 15 bucks an hour. And we are going to end the absurdity of women making 80 cents on the dollar compared to men. We believe in equal pay for equal work. Now next week on Wednesday, I'm going to be going to Arkansas. I guess there's an airport near here. We're going to be going to Arkansas, which is the home of the Walmart Corporation. And let me give you some examples of what a rigged economy is about and what we are going to transform. The Walton family, as some of you may know, the family that owns Walmart is the wealthiest family in America. It is worth $175 billion. Got that $175 billion. That's real money. And yet, that family worth $175 billion pays its workers wages that are so low that many of those workers are forced to go on food stamps, Medicaid and other businesses. And subsidized housing. And who pays for those workers, food stamps, and Medicaid? So my message to the Walton family next week will be we are sick and tired of giving you corporate welfare. The working class of this country will not subsidize the wealthiest family in America. Pay your workers a living wage. Last year, I received a number of complaints from workers at Amazon. Amazon is owned by the wealthiest individual in this country. A guy named Jeff Bezos. Now, he's not quite as wealthy as the Walton family. He is only worth about $114 billion. He's struggling. It's tough. He wants to catch up to the Walton's, but he's not quite there yet. And we heard from workers at Amazon, and they said, Bernie, we are getting starvation wages and our working conditions are terrible. Well, we work with those employees, and we were able to get Amazon to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour. But that's only half of the story where we talked about a rigged economy. Turns out that last year, the wealthiest guy in the country, Mr. Bezos, who owns Amazon, saw his company make $11 billion in profit. Not bad. How much money did Amazon pay in taxes last year? San Jose is a really smart crowd. Okay. You're right. He paid zero. So here is what the rigged economy is about. Wealthiest family in America paying their workers' starvation wages, getting bailed out by working people. The wealthiest individual in this country owning a company that made $11 billion and not paying a nickel in taxes. Brothers and sisters, together we are going to end that rigged economy. And when Amazon and dozens of other corporations that pay nothing today in taxes start paying their fair share of taxes, when we do away with these tax havens all over the world, where billionaires are putting their money to avoid fair taxation, and when we do that, we are going to have the money in this country to do some extraordinary things. We are going to pass a transaction tax on Wall Street speculation, which will raise enough money to make public colleges and universities tuition free. I want everybody in this country who has the desire and the ability to be able to get the higher education they need to go out and get the good jobs that are out there. And I will tell you something else that we are going to do. It is an outrage beyond words. I have talked to so many people impacted by this. That young people go to school and they borrow and borrow in order to get their degree. And then after being in debt $50,000 or $100,000, it takes them year after year to pay off that student debt. People in America should not be punished for trying to get a good education. And together, we are going to substantially reduce the level of student debt in America. Brothers and sisters, Donald Trump embarrasses us every day. He embarrasses us with his effort to try to divide our nation up. He embarrasses us with his religious bigotry. And I want to say thank you to all of our Muslim friends who are here today. Who are saluting. He embarrasses us with his ugly immigration policies and his demonization of immigrants. But there is something that he does that is above and beyond embarrassment. And that is he endangers our country and the entire world by refusing to understand what the scientific community is loud and clear about. And that is climate change is real. Climate change is caused by human activity. And climate change is already causing devastating problems in our country and around the world. Now, it seems to me that we have a moral responsibility to make certain that the planet we leave our children and grandchildren is a planet that is healthy and is habitable. That is a moral responsibility. Today, we say to the fossil fuel industry that it is not acceptable that you think your short-term profits are more important than the future of this planet. Now, all of you know that climate change is not just an American issue. It is an issue that impacts virtually every country on earth. And here is a promise I will make to you today that as your president, I will lead the world. We will have the United States lead the world to bring countries together. And our message will be that instead of spending a trillion and a half dollars every year all over the world on weapons of destruction, weapons designed to kill each other, why don't we use that wealth to transform the global energy system and save the planet? And I want to say a word. And actually, I want to speak to the men more than the women on this issue. All of you are aware that in Alabama and in Georgia and other states, legislation is being passed which denies the women of this country the constitutional right to control their bodies. The eye as president will do everything I can and a president can do a lot to make sure that it is women and not politicians who control the bodies of women. I have been asked by the media whether I have any litmus tests regarding those that I would nominate to be Supreme Court justices. And let me tell you that I do have a litmus test. I will never nominate anyone to be a Supreme Court justice unless I am 100% convinced that that individual will defend to the death row versus weight. And I want to say to the men who are here today, this is not a woman's issue, this is an issue for all of us. And now is the time for the men of this country to stand with the women. And I want to say a word about another issue that tragically is on the front pages today. And that is the mass murder that you are all aware of that took place in Virginia Beach. And I don't know what to say about this because every time there's a mass murder, the media says, what do you think and everyone says the same old thing. I want to tell you that in a nation that has hundreds of millions of guns, hundreds of millions of guns, that in a nation which sadly has many mentally unstable people who own some of those guns. I am not here to tell you that I have any magical solution on how to end the mass gun violence we're seeing and have seen throughout this country. But this is what I will tell you. I will do everything I can to pass common sense gun safety legislation. And among many other things that has to be done 30 years ago, Iran for office, lost the election and maybe I lost it because 30 years ago when I ran for Congress in Vermont, I said that assault weapons on military weapons designed to kill large numbers of people in a few minutes. Those are weapons that a civilian society should not have. I said it then and I say it now. Let us ban. Let us ban the sale and distribution of military style assault weapons in this country. I want to say a word about another issue and that is the need to reform a broken criminal justice system. This is America. We should not have more people in jail than any other country on earth. And that is why instead of spending $80 billion a year locking people up, we're going to use some of that money to invest in our young people making sure they get the jobs and the education that they need. We'll use that money for our young people rather than building more jails and having more incarceration. Now we made some progress on this issue four years ago. When I was campaigning here in California, I said that if we're going to have real criminal justice reform, we need to end the war on drugs and legalize marijuana. And that is exactly what we have to do in that idea is spreading all across the country. And when we talk about criminal justice reform, we're going to end private prisons and detention centers. We're going to end the system that allows 400,000 people to be in jail today for the crime of being poor and not being able to afford cash bail. And there's another issue that I know is a sensitive issue here in California and in fact all over the country. And that is the fact that we have a president who demonizes immigrants. Well, we are going to end that demonization. And together we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship. We are going to provide immediate as soon as we can legal protection for the 1.8 million young people in this country eligible for the DACA program. And we are going to initiate a new border policy. America is not and must never be a nation in which babies are snatched from the arms of their mothers where families are separated where children are put in cages. We will develop a humane respectful border policy. So brothers and sisters, here we are today in an unprecedented moment in American history. We have a president who is a pathological liar. We have a president who is a racist, a sexist, a homophobic, and a xenophobic. And that's his good qualities. All right. But our job is to end that kind of divisiveness and that kind of hatred. We are seeing sprouting up all over this country. Our job is to understand that if we think big, not small, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish. Yes, we can create a Medicare for All system. Yes, yes, we can make public colleges and universities tuition free. Yes, we can raise the minimum wage to a living wage and create millions of good paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. And by combating climate change through a green new deal. Yes, we can end a broken and racist criminal justice system and significantly reduce the people who are now in jail. And yes, we can have a humane and decent immigration system. On all of those issues and many more, the majority of the American people support us. But that support doesn't mean anything if people are not involved in the political process. So what the political revolution that I'm asking you to participate in is about. It's not only fighting for progressive policies, but it is going out and bringing your friends and family and co-workers into the political revolution. Now it is true. It is sadly and absolutely true that the top 1% in this country has enormous wealth and enormous power. That is true. They control the economy. They control the Congress. They control the media. But at the end of the day, the 1% is 1%. And I may not be a Nobel Prize-winning mathematician. But I do know that 99% is a heck of a lot bigger number than 1%. In other words, they have the money. They have the power. We have the people. So our job right now and in the next 8 months is to bring our people together. And when you go out and you talk to your friends, they say, well, where were you yesterday? And you said I went to a Bernie Sanders rally. And they say to you, why do you get involved in politics? Don't you know it's all bullshit? And you tell them that you are sick and tired of hearing them talk about how they can't afford rent. How they're not making enough money. Have they worried about climate change? How they're paying off their student debt? Tell them to shut up or put up. So we have got to bring our friends, our family, and our coworkers into the political process. And when we do that, when millions of people stand up and demand justice in this country, brothers and sisters, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. Thank you all very much. Thank you all very much.",

        "transcript": " Good evening. Our great nation is now living in an unprecedented moment. We're facing the worst public health crisis in a hundred years and the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. We are confronting systemic racism and the enormous threat to our planet of climate change. And in the midst of all of this, we have a president who is not only incapable of addressing these crises, but is leading us down the path of authoritarianism. This selection is the most important in the modern history of this country. In response to the unprecedented crises we face, we need an unprecedented response, a movement like never before, of people who are prepared to stand up and fight for democracy and decency and against greed, alagocchi and bigotry. And we need Joe Biden as our next president. Let me take this opportunity to say a word to the millions of people who supported my campaign this year and in 2016. My friends, thank you for your trust, your support, and the love you showed Jane, me, and our family. Together, we have moved this country in a bold new direction, showing that all of us, black and white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, Native born and immigrant, yearn for a nation based on the principles of justice, love, and compassion. Our campaign ended several months ago, but our movement continues and is getting stronger every day. Many of the ideas we fought for that just a few years ago were considered radical on now mainstream. But let us be clear, if Donald Trump is re-elected, all the progress we have made will be in jeopardy. At its most basic, this election is about preserving our democracy. During this president's term, the unthinkable has become normal. He has tried to prevent people from voting, undermine the U.S. Postal Service, deploy the military and federal agents against peaceful protesters, threaten to delay the election and suggest that he will not leave office if he loses. This is not normal, and we must never treat it like it is. Under this administration, authoritarianism has taken root in our country. I and my family and many of yours know the insidious way authoritarianism destroys democracy, decency, and humanity. As long as I am here, I will work with progressives, with moderates, and yes, with conservatives to preserve this nation from a threat that so many of our heroes fought and died to defeat. This president is not just the threat to our democracy, but by rejecting science, he has put our lives and health in jeopardy. Trump has attacked doctors and scientists, trying to protect us from the pandemic, while refusing to take strong action to produce the masks, gowns, and gloves our healthcare workers desperately need. Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump gals. His actions fanned this pandemic resulting in over 170,000 deaths and a nation still unprepared to protect its people. Furthermore, Trump's negligence has exacerbated the economic crisis we are now experiencing. Since this pandemic began, over 30 million people have lost their jobs and many have lost their health insurance. Millions of working families are wondering how they will feed their kids and they're worried that they will be evicted from their homes. And how is Trump responded? Instead of maintaining the $600 a week unemployment supplement that workers were receiving and the $1,200 emergency checks that many of you received, instead of helping small businesses, Trump concocted fraudulent executive orders that do virtually nothing to address the crisis while threatening the very future of social security and Medicare. But the truth is that even before Trump's negligent response to this pandemic, too many hard working families have been caught on an economic treadmill with no hope of ever getting ahead. Together, we must build a nation that is more equitable, more compassionate, and more inclusive. I know that Joe Biden will begin that fight on day one. Let me offer you just a few examples of how Joe will move us forward. Joe supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This will give 40 million workers a pay raise and push the wage scale up for everyone else. Joe will also make it easier for workers to join unions, create 12 weeks of paid family leave, fund universal pre-K for three and four year olds, and make childcare affordable for millions of families. Joe will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and fight the threat of climate change by transitioning us to 100 percent clean electricity over the next 15 years. These initiatives will create millions of good-paying jobs all across our country. As you know, we are the only industrialized nation not to guarantee health care for all people. While Joe and I disagree on the best path to get universal coverage, he has a plan that will greatly expand health care and cut the cost of prescription drugs. Further, he will lower the eligibility age of Medicare from 65 down to 60. To help reform our broken criminal justice system, Joe will end private prisons and detention centers, cash bail, and the school to prison pipeline. And to heal the soul of our nation, Joe Biden will end the hate and division Trump has created. He will stop the demonization of immigrants, the coddling of white nationalists, the racist dogwistling, the religious bigotry, and the ugly attacks on women. My friends, I say to you, to everyone who supported other candidates in the primary, and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election. The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake. We must come together to feed Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president. My friends, the price of failure is just too great to imagine. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " for more than 30 years. Joe Biden took the train to work. As a single dad, he promised to be home to kiss the boys every night, and then make them breakfast in the morning. When he got on the train, everyone seemed equal to him. He had time for everybody. He was a little bit more than a little boy. Joe was a regular. He bought rounds of coffee for fellow passengers and crew. And he got to know the people he traveled with. These guys approached the next. They're always rocking, keeping their balance, collecting tickets, helping people with their bags or heavy as hell. And they're doing this for hours. And we became really good friends. He was very interested in my life, my children. It's time went on my grandchildren. People don't do that today. People don't even take time out to say hello or nod their head to the average working person. They look at us like we are important people. He would treat the conductor the same as he would the president of the United States. That is what dad taught us that everybody deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. And that's what we're doing. We're taking a dignity and respect. After Joe became Vice President, he cut down on his commute. But he kept in touch. When Greg Weaver had a heart attack, he got a phone call. I was in a barbershop in New York City in the phone rings. And sure enough, it was Vice President Biden asking me how I'm doing. Wanted to know the whole story. It's kind of funny that you're talking to the Vice President in the United States. But if I would have told them people in the barbershop, I don't think they would have believed me. I'm not saying it like it was me and I was anything special. Everybody was special to him. We have heroes all over this country. A lot of the essential workers out there that we don't even see that are behind the scenes. They're keeping this country going. He understands that.

Let me very briefly discuss my concerns about one of the nominees of the consideration of Joe Goughlin, who has been nominated to lead the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. I have nothing against Mr. Goughlin, and I hope and expect that he will do a very good job in the position that he has been nominated for. What I am concerned about is the implementation of a provision that I worked on with Chairman Copper, that was included in the Inflation Reduction Act to provide the EPA with $7 billion in federal funding for zero emissions technology. The legislative intent of this program is to make it more affordable, the low income and working-class homeowners to install solar on their rooftops and save money on their electricity bills. And by the way, when we do that, we create hundreds of thousands of good paying chops. If this program is implemented properly, it will provide solar to more than two million families in the United States over the next two years and catalyze up to 10 million residential solar installations over the next 10 years. Unfortunately, since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act in August, I've been unable to get a firm commitment in writing from the EPA to implement this program consistent with the clear legislative intent. The $7 billion program was not put into the Inflation Reduction Act for nuclear, electric vehicle charging stations, or any other type of energy. It was included in this bill primarily to expand residential solar and reduce the energy bills of millions of low income and middle-class families. So let me be clear, I will be voting for Mr. Goffman in this committee, but I will not support his nomination on the Senate floor until I receive a commitment from the EPA in writing that it will implement this program primarily to expand residential solar throughout this country. I want to thank Chairman Copper for his leadership on this issue and look forward to our continued work together to expand residential solar, lower the cost of electricity for consumers, and combat the existential threat of climate change. Thank you very much. Thank you, Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders, I'm pleased to be able to work with you and your team, my— Thank you, Mr. President. I want to take this opportunity to say a few words not only about the negotiations between railroad workers and the railroad management, but also to put that crisis into a broad economic context. Mr. President, it seems clear to me, and I think the polls indicated that the Americans and American people are becoming increasingly disgusted by the corporate greed they are seeing and experiencing every single day. They look out around them and they see three people on top owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society. They see corporate profits soaring while the prices they pay for the products they need continue to go up. They see CEOs of major corporations now making 400 times more than the average worker at that corporation. They have seen during this terrible pandemic when tens of thousands of workers died because they had to go to work. They have seen the billionaire class make $2 trillion more in their wealth. Further, they look around them and while the very wealthiest people in America become much richer, they walk down the street and they see people sleeping out on the sidewalks. We have almost 600,000 Americans who are homeless. People can't afford their health care cost. We have 85 million Americans who are uninsured or under-adjured. In other words, the economy is doing really, really, really well for CEOs and billionaires. For the average American worker, he or she is falling further and further behind. Now within that broad context of what's happening in the overall economy, let's take a look at what is going on in the rail industry today and why Congress is being asked to implement a union contract with rail workers to avoid a strike that could take place as early as December 9th. It turns out that when we talk about the extraordinary level of corporate greed in America, there is no better example of that than what is taking place in the rail industry today. They are the purest example of why the American people are so angry at what's taking place in our economy. If you look at the rail industry today, what you will understand is that this industry has seen huge, wrecked, breaking profits in recent years. Huge profits. In fact, in the first three quarters, not a whole year, three quarters of this year, the rail industry made a record-breaking $21 billion in profit. Further, they have so much money. Profits are so high that the industry spent over $25 billion this year not to improve rail safety, not to address the supply chain crisis, but to buy back its own stock and hand out huge dividends to its wealthy stockholders. In fact, since 2010, and I hope every member of Congress hears this, the rail industry has spent over $183 billion on stock buybacks and dividends. On top of all of that, the CEOs of many of these railroad companies are enjoying huge compensation packages. So, while workers struggle, last year, the CEO of CSX made over $20 million in total compensation. The CEO of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern made over $14 million each in total compensation. In other words, within the rail industry, corporate profits are soaring and CEOs are making incredibly large compensation packages. But in the midst of all of that, it is fair to ask what is going on for workers, profits, record breaking, CEOs, tens of millions of dollars a year in compensation, what is going on for the workers in the rail industry? And the reality is that the key issue in the rail dispute that we are dealing with right now, vote's taking place as we speak in the House, is not about salaries, not about how much money workers there are earning. The key issue is the working conditions in the rail industry which are absolutely unacceptable and literally beyond belief. Right now, if you work in the freight rail industry, and this is a job in the rail industry, this is really hard work, dangerous work, it's work to take places, takes place when it's going to be 20 below zero. If you are a worker in the rail freight industry, you are entitled to a grand total of zero sick days. Let me repeat that. You are entitled to a grand total of zero sick days. Now as a nation, industry after industry, government after government here in Congress, our people get sick, they have the right to take time off. It's humane, nobody, not the most conservative member of this institution would say to a worker, oh you got COVID, you're fired, it was unbelievable. And yet, what this means, the policy in the rail industry means is if you get sick, if your child gets sick, if your spouse gets sick and you need to take time off of work, not only will you not get paid, you actually will get reprimanded and could get fired. And that absurd inhumane situation is precisely what is taking place today in the rail industry. Mr. President, let me remind you and all of our colleagues that hundreds of Americans are still dying every day from COVID and tens of thousands are being hospitalized as a result of this terrible virus. What the freight rail industry is saying to its workers is this, it doesn't matter. If you have COVID, it doesn't matter if you are lying in a hospital bed because of a medical emergency, it doesn't matter if your wife has just given birth, it just doesn't matter. If you do not come into work no matter what the reason, we have the right to punish you, we have the right to fire you. Frankly, it is hard to believe that these conditions still exist in the United States of America in the year 2022. Let me give you just a few examples that I am familiar with hearing from workers. One rail worker was penalized by the railroads for spending the day in the hospital with his son who was having breathing issues. Another worker couldn't take his pregnant wife to the doctor because it could have resulted in disciplinary action for him. Tragically, we witnessed the death of a locomotive engineer who was forced to skip his doctor's appointment after experiencing unusual symptoms only to suffer a heart attack and die in an engine room weeks later. And here is what one rail worker recently said. I am tired of being tired all day every day and having every one of my coworkers being physically sick from sleep deprivation. Most of my coworkers can't stay awake anymore during a 12 hour trip end of quote. That's one rail worker. Mr. President, there is absolutely no reason why these workers should have to deal with these conditions in the richest country in the history of the world. And I won the president if the CEOs, the CEOs in the railroad industry or other top executives in this industry, I wonder if they get fired when they don't get into the office because of sickness or when they have a medical emergency in their families. So I think is, in fact, the head of the team says recently said this on a Brian that, you know, what's good for the CEOs in terms of paid sick leave is good for employees as well and I think he is absolutely right. Whatever I should add, as everybody knows, that quite sensibly the federal government guarantees 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave to its worker. So if you are an employee, for example, at the Department of Transportation in the United States of America sitting behind the desk, you are appropriately, appropriately guaranteed 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. But if you are an engineer running a train with tons of freight behind you, you get zero sick time. Now that may make sense to somebody, but it does not make sense to me. As a result of this incredibly reactionary policy of denying work at sick time, rail conductors, engineers and other rail employees are coming into work sick and exhausted, which is a danger not only to themselves, but to their co-workers and everyone else who is around them. The work they do is dangerous work. As the President, the United States, sadly, is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee paid sick days. We have seen that we hope to remedy. We try to remedy and we have to continue going forward so that we do remedy. It is a bit of an embarrassment that of all the major countries on earth. We are the only one not the guaranteed paid sick days. In Germany, workers are entitled to as many as 84 weeks of paid sick leave at 70 percent of their salary, depending upon how serious the illness is, and countries all depending upon how serious the illness is, and countries all over the world, and one way or another, have generous policies that recognize that in a modern civilized society, if you get sick, if your kids get sick, your wife or husband gets sick, you are entitled as a worker to have paid sick leave. But while government workers here in the United States and in many, many industries, many companies, guaranteed their workers, paid sick leave, rail workers in the United States of America today, and year 2022, are guaranteed zero paid sick days, zero. Now the rail industry has told us that they can't afford to provide paid sick days to their employees. Instead of sitting down and negotiating with their unions to bring about a reasonable compromise, for the past three years, the rail industry has refused to agree to a single day of guaranteed paid sick leave to its workers. They say it would cost too much money to provide their workers any paid sick days. Now let's see. They move over, they made over $21 billion in profits so far this year. They provide their CEOs with huge compensation packages. They spent 25 and a half billion to buy back their own stock and hand out huge dividends to their wealthy stockholders. But they are just too broke, too financially hot pressed to guarantee paid sick days to their employees. So here is where we are, Mr. President. Interestingly enough, it turns out the guaranteeing seven paid sick days to rail workers would cost the industry a grand total of $321 million a year, a tiny fraction of the 21 billion in profits that they have already made. If the major rail carriers can afford to spend 25 and a half billion dollars a year on stock buybacks and dividends, do not tell me that they cannot afford to guarantee paid sick days to their workers and allow these workers to have a reasonable quality of life. Mr. President, the outrage over the lack of paid sick leave is not the only issue that rail workers in America have been fighting for. The rail workers of this country are sick and tired of unreliable scheduling, which is having a negative impact on their personal and family lives. In America today, rail workers are on call for up to 14 consecutive days, 12 hours a day. In fact, it is not uncommon for many rail workers to be on call nearly 24 hours a day with a requirement to report to work within 90 minutes for shifts that can last nearly 80 hours. Now Mr. President, as you know, last September President Biden and Labor Secretary Walsh worked with the rail industry and union leaders to come up with a tentative agreement that was better than what the rail industry had been offering. But this agreement still does not require the industry to provide a single day of paid sick leave to workers. I thank President Biden and Secretary Walsh for their efforts, but Congress can and must do better. And that is why I will be introducing legislation to guarantee paid sick days to every rail worker in America. And I will insist on a roll call vote in the Senate on this legislation as part of any unanimous consent required to vote on the tentative rail deal. Now Mr. President, I hope very much and I think we may have bipartisan support for this modest legislation. And I would hope and I have talked to Republicans who indicate that they are prepared to support the workers. But I would say to every member of this body, Democrat Republican, that think long and hard about how you go home to your constituents and say, I voted against allowing rail workers in this country seven paid sick days. So I hope and think about how you can explain that vote. And Mr. President, that's be clear. It's not just the rail unions and Bernie Sanders who believe that working conditions on the railroads with no guaranteed sick leave is wrong and inhumane. It turns out that the view is shared by some of the railroads major business customers who are seeing a decline in the service that they are receiving and that they need. Let me quote from a recent op ed by Eric Bial, the president and CEO of the National Association of Chemical Distributors who wrote an update entitled, railroads should give workers the benefits they see. And here is what Mr. Baya wrote. And again, this is a business organization that wants to make sure that their product is delivered on the railroads in a reasonable period of time and on schedule. And Mr. Baya writes quote, to say the paid sick leave policy for rail workers is woefully inadequate would be an understatement. The negotiated agreement does not include any significant measures to improve quality of life issues. Several workers today have zero time allotted to them by their freight rail employers for sick leave. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, private sector workers receive seven to eight days of sick leave per year. A fragile and volatile supply chain requires a strong rail network. Now is not the time to deny reasonable benefits for a labor community that has been decimated by losses in recent years. It's time for the freight industry to write this wrong and get rail back on track end of quote. That's from the chemical distributors and important customer of the railroads. And it's not just the chemical distributors and I want people to hear what the chairman of the surface transportation board, Martin Overman, had to say about the horrendous working conditions in the rail industry at a conference with rail executives earlier this month. And here is what Mr. Overman said quote, when railroads try to excuse their failures by pointing to labor shortages at other businesses, those other businesses did not enter the pandemic having stripped themselves of nearly 20% of their workforce in recent years. Today the railroads tell us they are still having a hard time recruiting and retaining workers and try to blame this on the great resignation. The fact is the railroads personnel practices made these jobs much less desirable. And according to Mr. Overman, the railroad industry has slashed its workforce by 10% since the pandemic started slashing some 13,000 jobs. And he continued, again this is Mr. Overman saying quote, class one rail companies over the past two and a half years saved roughly 4.8 billion in payroll during the same two and a half years. The class one rail companies have returned nearly 60 billion to stockholders and stock buybacks and dividends more than 12 times what they saved in payroll. Like the shareholders have been satisfied with only 55 billion in buybacks and dividends apparently not. 4.8 billion in saved payroll would have been a drop in the bucket but the operating ratio had to be met end of quote. So what are you saying? What I think many of us understand is the railroads are making huge profits. They have seen their profit margins nearly triple over the past 20 years and during the last six years they have reduced their workforce by 30%. You want to make more money? That's the way you do it. You cut back on your workforce. And now they are in a situation where they're telling workers if you get COVID you're going to get fired. So clearly we need to rethink the entire business model of the rail industry. So right now the issue before us is not complicated. And that is that in an industry which is enjoying record breaking profits and industry which laid off 30% of its workforce in the last six years and industry which gives its CEOs huge compensation packages. Now is the time for that industry to respect its workers and treat them with the dignity that all working people are entitled to. So Mr. President we are an important moment not just for the rail industry not only for rail workers. The issue is whether or not this United States Senate will join the House and my understand is that the House just passed paid sick leave seven days they did the right thing and I want to applaud the members of the House for doing the right thing and now it's going to come here to the Senate. Do we stand with workers in the rail industry and say yes you are right. Working conditions are horrendous. We cannot continue a process by which you have zero paid sick leave. Do we stand with workers or do we stand with an industry that is making huge profits, pays us CEOs absorb in it, salaries and treats its working workers with contempt. That's the choice that the Senate will soon be having to make and I hope very much that in a bipartisan way we can do the right thing and tell the rail workers and tell every worker in America that the United States Congress is prepared to stand with them and not just the people on top who are doing extraordinarily well and with that Mr. President I would yield before. Mr. President. The side of working families who are struggling every day. She's on the side of raising the minimum wage to a living wage. She's on the side of making it easier for workers to join unions. She's on the side of saying that healthcare is a human right and that every person in this country deserves healthcare. She's on the side of making it clear that all of our young people in this country no matter what their income is are entitled to higher education to wish it free at a public college or university. So that's what this campaign is about. Nationally what the Republicans want to do is give massive tax breaks to the very, very wealthiest people in this country and then cut social security Medicare and Medicaid. Because of turning their back on the existential threat of climate change which is going to impact not only Texas for a whole world. So the choice in this campaign is pretty clear. The turnout is not going to be high which means that every vote counts and we have got to do everything that we can. If people tell you this election doesn't matter, tell them it matters big time which party controls the House of the Senate. Now I'll give you one more example. One, not one children remember. A couple of years ago we would not have had this rally because we would be in the midst of a terrible pandemic situation. We will remember that. Remember thousands of Americans dying every single day. At that point because Democrats controls the House and the Senate, marginally we have 50, 50 in the Senate. We wrote the American Rescue Plan. And I want you to remember what we did with that plan. In the midst of a pandemic, in the midst of a time when millions of workers were losing their jobs, we made sure that every man, woman and child in this country had to check a $1,400. Remember that? Yes! Alright. That's a family of four, $5,600 bucks. That kept families afloat, prevented people from getting evicted from their apartments. Now we are being attacked for doing that but I make no apologies for doing that. In the midst of that pandemic and massive unemployment, we extended unemployment benefits so when workers lost their jobs, they had food on the table to feed their kids. In the midst of that pandemic when hospitals were overflowing with COVID patients, some of them were on the verge of collapse. We put billions of dollars to strengthen hospitals. We made sure that every parent in this country got a check of $300 a month per child. Remember that? Yes! That up matter? Yes! Alright. That's what we did without one bloody Republican vote. It was expensive. Yes, it was expensive. It was worth it because we saved lives, we saved dignity. Republicans have a different view. They want to spend their money by giving tax breaks to the rich and cutting programs for working families. That is what this election is about. We need Michelle in the Congress. Let us go out and knock on doors. Let's talk to our friends. Let's bring people out to the voting polls. Plus, make sure Michelle is the next Congresswoman from this district. Thank you. You have your own name. Good evening. No question about it. While we don't have the final results yet, yesterday's midterm elections turned out far better than people had expected. And you made that happen. Thank you. First, let me give a shout out to all those who came out and voted. Voted turnout was high, especially in some battleground states like Pennsylvania. Without that kind of citizen participation and voter turnout, John Federman would not have been elected to the U.S. Senate. Further on a personal note, let me thank the over 14,000 people who attended the 19 rallies that we recently held in Oregon, California, Nevada, Texas, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Turnout was great and the energy level was high. Let me especially thank the young people who overwhelmingly came out to vote not just for women's rights and gay rights and environmental justice and to protect our democracy, but also understand that we must have an economy, any government that works for all of us, not just for 1%. While the turnout among young people is still not as high as we would like, there is no doubt that young people played a decisive role in this election. Young voters in Pennsylvania, the Hampshire and Arizona supported Democrats by over 70% landslide proportions and played a decisive role in electing senators, members of Congress, governors, and members of the legislature. If there is anything that gives me hope about the future of our country, it is that our younger generation is the most progressive generation in history. This is a generation that has fought racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and bigotry of all kinds. In America and throughout the world, young people have also been leaders in the fight against climate change and the need to take on the greed and irresponsibility of the fossil fuel industry. What knows that there are a lot of important issues out there, the issue of women's right to control their own body, the issue of the attacks on the very foundation of our democracy by right-wing extremists, the issue of gun safety, and many others, but at a time of massive wealth and income inequality, let me also thank working class voters and union voters for standing up against corporate greed and voting for candidates who have the guts to stand up for the moneyed and powerful interests. I was happy to see that in the last few weeks of this campaign, many candidates made it clear that they were prepared to take on Republicans who want to give huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country and then cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and I thank all of those candidates who raised that very, very important set of issues. Let me also mention that last night was a great night for progressive candidates. Despite the huge amount of money spent by billionaires and their superpacks against us in support of right-wing politicians, there will now be more strong progresses in the U.S. House than ever before in modern history. Let me just name a few of them. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate Somalee on her resounding, strong victory in Pennsylvania's 12th District, Somoran a great grassroots campaign and was slurred on outside money from billionaires. She will be a great congresswoman from Pittsburgh for the working families of our country. Congratulations also to Becca Balant on her historic win. Becca will be the first woman ever elected from my own state of Vermont to the U.S. Congress, and I look forward to working with her on behalf of Vermont's families. Texas, thank you very much for sending Greg Kazaugh to the U.S. Congress. I know Greg well enough to know that he will be a great leader in Congress and I want to congratulate him on his great victory. Congratulations to Jasmine Crockett on her victory last night in the 30th District of Texas. Jasmine will be a much needed voice for voting rights and for an economy that represents the needs of working families in Texas and throughout our country. I also want to congratulate Jonathan Jackson, an old friend of mine, on his victory in the first district of Illinois. Jonathan understands the need for racial justice in this country and for the need to create an economy that works for all. Congratulations to Delia Ramirez on her win last night. She has been a champion of working families and immigrants in Illinois and I know that she will continue her fight for them in Congress. Congratulations to Val Hoyle on her win in Oregon last night. Val knows what it means to stand up for working people and fight for raising the minimum wage, passing paid sick and medical leave and for workers' rights and I very much looking look forward to working with Val in Washington. Last but not least congratulations to Maxwell Frost on his historic victory in Florida's 10th District. Maxwell will be the first member of Gen Z elected to Congress and I want to congratulate him on his historic victory. Now I would not be telling you the truth. If I told you that we won everything last night, we certainly did not. Some excellent progressive candidates lost and we are still not sure at this moment where the Democrats will be controlling the Senate and even possibly the House. But no matter what happens in that regard, tonight I am asking you to please stay engaged. Please continue fighting for justice, economic justice, social justice, racial justice and environmental justice. Last night, 58% of the electorate in the red state of Nebraska voted to increase the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. With your help, we can and must do the same thing in Washington for every worker in America. Raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Last night, a majority in the red state of Missouri voted yes to legalize marijuana. With your help, we can and must legalize marijuana in every state in our country. Last night, a majority in the red states of Kentucky in Montana joined the red state of Kansas, invoting against ballot initiatives the ban abortion. With your help, we will codify Roe v Wade and make abortion legal in every state in America. Last night, we beat back some very dark forces. You made that happen. That's what happens when people stand up and fight back. That needs us to say the struggle is far far from over. There is an enormous amount of work yet to be done. Let's do it together and thank you all for what you're doing. Take care. Further and further, Bob. And I want to say a word about this inflation. Just from publicism to going around and they're saying inflation is a serious problem. It is. A lot of people are hurting. Gas prices, food prices, drug prices, whatever they do. What they don't tell you is what the causes of inflation are. They want to blame Joe Biden. They want to blame Bernie Sanders for inflation. But we have got to explain basic economics as well, one, two, and that is inflation is not just an American issue. In the United Kingdom, inflation is 10% to 0.5% than it is in America. In Europe, it's 11%. We're 18%. The causes of inflation are the pandemic and the breakdown of supply change, race prices. The causes of inflation are the terrible, terrible war, or invasion of Ukraine and all the baddest. But there is another cause of inflation which Republicans in a billion years will never corporate. And the major cause of inflation today, the recent like prices of gas pump in the grocery store of sorting, is because of corporate greed. If you want to know where you paid high prices of gas pump, ask S.S. on mobile who are trying to break in breaking profits right now. If you want to know where food prices are high, ask the major food companies to jack up their prices to uncomfortable levels. Take a deep breath and think about the morality of the issue. We live in a moment because of this pandemic, a lot of instability in the country, a lot of uncertainty. People are burdened. You have the war in Ukraine, you have the breakdown of supply chains. And we're corporate America is saying, not how can we help working? How could we lower prices in this country to make things more affordable? But they are saying the guy from next time mobile is really honest about it. This is another opportunity to raise prices as high as we can. And what we say, this time is immoral, it is war and that is why we are not opposed a virtual profit tax on the country. I want to say this as well. The public is going around and the same, the close of inflation is the large amount of federal spending with the American breastfeeding plan. And it's the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I hope, like that bill. I don't know about that. I want you all to think back two years ago. We were country without vaccines. Thousands of people every day were dying. People by the millions were losing their jobs. Remember that? And what the president of the United States and what Congress did without what Republican voting is what we said in today. And what? What working people are struggling with hunger in America is on the rise. What people are worried about being evicted from their accomplishments to the handful of the pay for it. You know what? Yes. We will provide $1400 for every man more than a child in this country. And I know the power tries for them. And that won the public in voting for them. And what millions of people because of their pandemic were state jobs. Remember that unemployment went off to the talks. We said yes. We are going to extend unemployment benefits. And when working ones and this were unable to provide for their pigs, we said yes. We are going to provide a free hyper-evalent amount of child pass credit for everyone to get them out. And when the hospitals, when some hospitals in America were on the verge of collapse because so many COVID patients were entering and their doctors were getting sick and their nurses were getting sick, we said yes. We got a few billions that helped hospitals get their patients. And we are going to help you to get the vaccine to help you get this survive the pandemic. And I apologize to no one. I'm Brittany Lewis with Forbes Breaking News. At Thursday, Senate Health Committee hearing, Senator Bernie Sanders questioned FDA Commissioner Robert Kalyft. Sanders asked if Kalyft was concerned about the extremely limited number of companies that produced baby formula. Currently, three companies dominate the entire infant formula market. Abbott, Mead, and Nestley. This Senator also asked how the FDA plans to prevent future shortages. Watch the entire exchange here. Thank you. Senator Sanders. Thank you, Madam Chair. Dr. Kalyft, concentration of ownership in our economy is a major major problem in many sectors. It's true on Wall Street, it's true in energy, it's food production in general. It is certainly true in the production of infant formula, which is so terribly important to millions of parents with babies. Right now, we have three companies, Abbott, Mead, and Nestley, who dominate the entire market. We have recently been discussing contamination at an Abbott facility. Tomorrow, it could be Nestley. Are you concerned? And what are you doing about broadening the number of companies who are producing infant formula? I'm very concerned, and as I said, my opening remarks is not unique to this industry that we're seeing concentration that puts everything at risk. And I'll remind you, as you well know, there is no requirement that companies show us their backup plans. Right. But all I'm asking, and I've got other questions, is what are you doing right now to aggressively make sure that more companies are producing infant formula? So we'll not see this problem re-curd them all. I'm sorry, Senator, I'm going to interrupt it. On a temporary measure, we lowered some of the, reduced some of the paperwork so that many more foreign manufacturers can import. We've got 26 applications, since we opened the portal just over a week ago. The largest producer Nestley worldwide hardly had any presence in the U.S. and they're going to help out quite a bit. They're very capable. I hope that you will focus on increasing the number of companies who are producing so we don't run into this problem. Yes. Let me ask you this. On October 20th of last year, a whistleblower sent a 34-page report to the FDA describing in detail how the equipment and avid manufacturing plant in Michigan, quote, was failing in a need of repair and that the company knew that this was a problem for at least five years. According to this report, I've had falsified records to cover up deficiencies at its plant, improperly trained employees, and successfully hid health and safety risks from FDA orders in 2019. And even though this report was submitted to your agency last October, FDA did not interview the whistleblower until late December. Now my question is during that same period of time, avid saw a $7 billion increase in its profits and its CEO, Mr. Ford, saw very substantial increases in his compensation packages. If a company lies to the FDA about its safety situation, at the same time, it does massive stock buybacks, gives the CEO use compensation packages, are you going to find them? What are you going to do to make sure the industry understands that you simply cannot lie to a government agency? The whistleblower's complaint was received and the usual staff reviewed it and did the interview. It was not escalated to the leaders of the FDA who were responsible and that was an error that's now been rectified in terms of process. In terms of the status of the whistleblower complaint, I'm not in a position to comment on whether they may be legal proceedings. I'm not even asking about the whistleblower complaint. If a major corporation lies to the FDA about something as terribly important, the safety of infant formula, what are you going to do? Get the same time they do billions in stock buybacks, huge compensation packages for its CEO. Is the government, is the agency going to say sorry? It is more important to protect the babies of this country than to give huge compensation packages to your CEOs. Are you going to stand up to them? Senator Sanders, we are standing out there. As I said, I'm not in a position to say whether criminal proceedings are underway or not. Is that something in consideration? I'm just not in a position to comment on that. Well I would hope that manufacturers of baby formula, which is so terribly important to parents and obviously the babies, understand they cannot lie to the Food and Drug Administration. And I hope you are strong about that. Well, Senator, as you know, I've worked on all sides of this. I've been inspected and everyone understands when you lie to the FDA and you get caught, there's going to be big trouble. Well, I hope they will be. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, New York! Whoa! And let me thank the people of New York for sending Alexandria to the U.S. Congress. She is not only one of the great members of Congress, she is inspiring working people and young people all across the country. Thank you, New York! Everybody knows that a New York City may as race attracts a lot of attention. That's not new. It's the largest city in the country. You've got 8 million people. Everybody is interested in what happens here. But this may as race, my friends, is different. It is not just the folks here in New York City who are paying attention. It's not just people all across our country who are watching this race. It is not just the president of the United States who seems to be very, very concerned about who wins this election. The truth is that people all over the world are paying attention to what will happen here a week from Tuesday. Now why is that? Why has this campaign created such an unbelievable amount of interest literally all over the world? And the answer is obvious. These are not normal times. This is not a normal election. This election takes place at a moment in American history when we have a rigged economy with more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had in the history of our country. This election takes place at a time when the wealthiest people in America have never, ever had it so good while 60% of people in our country are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to pay their rent or mortgage, struggling to afford childcare or higher education for their kids, struggling to afford healthcare, struggling to afford decent quality food, struggling how to figure out how they will retire with some shred of dignity after working their entire lives. This election takes place when the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty and senior poverty of almost any nation. And when in this rich country, 800,000 Americans, including many veterans, are homeless. This election takes place at a time when we have a president who has given a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1%. This has given 900 billion in tax breaks to the largest corporations in our country. And to pay for those tax breaks, he is throwing 15 million Americans off the healthcare they have by slashing Medicaid. And in addition, he is forcing over 20 million Americans to see a doubling in their healthcare premiums. The selection is taking place when we have an administration in Washington which every day is moving us toward an authoritarian society undermining our constitution and the rule of law. This election is taking place when we have a corrupt campaign finance system which allows billionaires in both political parties to select the candidates they want and to buy elections. Ordinary Americans get one vote, you get one vote, meanwhile, billionaires get the opportunity to spend as much as they want to elect the candidates they want. That is the context in which this election is taking place. That is why this election is so enormously important and that is why Zoran Mamdani must become the next mayor of New York. New York must have a mayor who represents the working families of this city, not the billionaires class. The reason why this campaign has generated so much interest around the world and so much excitement is that people want to know the answer to one very simple question and that is in the year 2025 when the people on top have never ever had so much economic and political power. Is it possible for ordinary people for working class people to come together and defeat those oligots? You are damn right we can. Let me tell you something else. At a moment when Americans are extremely distressed about where we are as a nation economically and politically, a victory here in New York will give hope and inspiration to people throughout our country and throughout the world. That is what this election is about and that is why Donald Trump is paying attention to this election. Ordinary people working class people black and white and Latino Asian gay and straight coming together to take on the oligarchy that is Trump's worst nightmare. What Trump and his oligarchy friends know that if New Yorkers come together and elect Zoran we can do that from California to Maine. We can defeat the oligarchy. And what the oligarchs fear, what they fear is that people will start understanding that this country belongs to us, not them. And all over the country when people are inspired, when people are standing up to power they will ask some very simple questions. Why are we in the United States the only major country not to guarantee health care to all as a human right? Why aren't we paying our teachers the salaries they deserve? So that we can have the best public educational system in the world. Why aren't we doing what used to exist in New York and all over this country 70 years ago make public colleges and universities tuition free? Why in the richest country on earth are we ending homelessness and building 5 million units of low income and affordable housing? Why don't we make it easier for workers to join unions? And why don't we raise the national minimum wage to a living wage? And with so many of our seniors are struggling to cover their basic needs, some 22% of seniors in America are trying to survive on $15,000 a year less. Why aren't we raising social security benefits and providing pensions to the workers in this country who doesn't really need them? And why don't we have a foreign policy which does not spend billions of dollars on a net in y'all, government, starving children, hey, Gossal? In other words, in other words, my friends, in other words, my friends, a victory for this country will help Americans understand that in the richest country in the history of the world there is nothing we cannot accomplish. Now the oligarchs and the political establishment in New York tell us that the runs agenda for New York is radical. Really? At a time when working families in this city are finding it hard to live here because of the outrageously high cost of housing, I don't think it's radical to say that the city should freeze the rent and triple its stock of affordable housing. That ain't radical. At a time when working families can't afford the high cost of childcare and psychologists tell us the most important years of human development, intellectual and emotional are zero through four. Why shouldn't we have a situation where every child in America gets the best quality childcare we could provide? That ain't radical. Taking care of our kids is not radical. At a time when getting to work is too expensive and we want to encourage more utilization of public transportation, it is not a radical idea to say that buses in this city should be free and fast. At a time when every parent wants their kids eating good quality food, not junk food, and there are neighborhoods in this city where it is simply not affordable or possible to get that food. It is not a radical idea to say that there should be unisably funded grocery stores. And by the way, when billionaires and large corporations and the very wealthy are doing extraordinarily well, when the very richest people in this country often pay an effective tax rate lower than truck drivers or nurses. It is not a radical idea to say that the rich should start paying their fair share of taxes. Brothers and sisters, these ideas are not radical. They are common sense and they are what the people of New York City want and need. Now let me be very clear. As someone who served as mayor of Burlington for eight years, a city just a little bit smaller than New York, I can tell you absolutely that being mayor is not an easy job. In local government, the people hold you accountable for everything. To pick it up the trash, for crime problems, for the quality of education that kids receive, for traffic jams, blame the mayor. And that's what mayors have to deal with. And it is not easy. So Ron Mamdani is mayor is not going to have all the answers. The problems facing this country and every other major city in America are in fact enormous. So let me say this to you from the bottom of my heart. When he is elected, your job is not over. The Ron wins going to need your help every single day. And this unprecedented moment in our nation's history, all of us together must act in an unprecedented way. And that means governing New York City and other cities in an unprecedented way. Please do everything you can to work with Ron in order to make him and his administration the best administration in the history of New York. To me, conclude by saying this, and I say this again as somebody who became mayor of Burlington Vermont in 1981 by winning that election by 10 votes after recap. Now I have looked at the polls here in New York. You have seen it. And the polls suggest that Ron is in the lead and that is great. But please, please, please do not underestimate our opponents. They have a huge amount of money and they are spending it right now. So I urge you, forget about the polls, go into the last eight days of this election assuming that you are five points behind. So what you guys are going to have to do along with the other 80,000 volunteers in the Bumdami campaign, you've got to do everything that you can to bring people to the polls in early voting, which is taking place right now and on election day. None of us want to wake up the day after the election and find that we lost that election because our opponents outworked us. That must not happen. Because in Cystis, a year ago, very few people in New York knew about a 33-year-old assemblyman named Siran Mambani. And when he first entered this race for mayor, he was polling at all of 1%. Nobody knew who this guy was. But Siran did what people who are serious about real change always do. He created a campaign from the bottom on up by building an extraordinary and unprecedented grass roots movement which now has tens of thousands of volunteers. Unlike his opponents, he didn't go running to the billionaires for campaign contributions. He went to the people with an agenda that made sense to them and despite being outspent four to one, Siran won the primary. Brothers and sisters, with your help over the next eight days, this young man is going to make American history. It is my honor to introduce the next mayor of the city of New York, Siran Mambani.",

We have an amazing show tonight. And I'm so excited to be here to support the only candidate who actually wants to make the cost of living in the city actually affordable. The cost of rent is too high and so is the cost of everything else. And everybody's so excited to be here. And did I forget anything else important I'm going to say? No, I'm just excited to be supporting Zora and Mam Donnie for mayor. I'm going to be your MC tonight. So get used to seeing my ugly sweaty ass. And I'm excited to be supporting a candidate who wants to make the city more affordable. And he's the only candidate who doesn't seem to be sweating all the time. So are you guys ready for an amazing show? You can't even believe it! Thanks for coming. Stick around. I'll see you guys soon. Love you. Have fun! This is what it actually looks like. Showing up day after day after day and making it clear that the fight that management is picking is not just with the workers of this one company. It's with this city at large. Where workers do not have to beg for what they deserve. Here Zora was with us on the picket line from day one. We won the best contract we've ever gotten. We aren't alone. Zora, solve this struggle and keep partnered up with my union. And because of this organized effort, we were able to secure the largest debt relief New York City history. Thank you, Ana Goliath, for taking out of less your solidarity with their lives. Have a nice evening. It's good to see you. Are you fully ahead? These are members volunteering their time. We really understand the needs of the working class. Also our fighting for a city where the workers can rest. And when I think about who won the weekend, it's organized labor. I believe every New Yorker deserves a life of dignity, safety and stability and that its city government's job to deliver that. Hello everyone. My name is Arturo Navrao Tresero. For 45 years, Miyawela was a member of 32BJ, cleaning the floors of Midtown Office Building. And now thanks to my CUNY education, I teach sociology at Kingsborough Community College. CUNY, Brooklyn's only community college. For four years, I have been a member of PSC CUNY. The union represented 30,000 faculty and staff through my role as a student mentor to students. And a member of union committees. I have seen first hand that fighting together, our members changed the lives of students and workers together. We have spent years fighting Trump's puppet Andrew Cuomo, who starved CUNY of resources and jacked up tuition. And jacked up tuition for working class students. Now we are facing extreme repression. Members have even been investigated and some have lost their jobs for speaking up for Palestine. We fought Cuomo then and we will fight these attacks now together. So our union is fighting to elect CUNY champion Doran Mandani to be an expert who will fight against Trump and who is fighting to build the people's university that New Yorkers deserve. What's up New York? Are we ready to elect Doran Mandani? Are we ready to elect Doran Mandani? Make some noise! My name is Chris Sabenz. I am a non-security officer of the Major Commercial Building in Mental Manhattan. And I'm organizing to win the union with 32 BJ. 32! 32! 32! 32! Now did you know that our city has 82,000 low-weight security officers? Did you know that the average officer makes $40,000 a year? $40,000 a year? That's poverty wages! Poverty! And almost 40% of us do not have healthy jobs. Whoa! I have a few health problems over the years. And each time I have to pay out of my pocket, it's no good. I'm here to let you all know that we are fed up. But we have big plans. Later this week we'll be at City Hall. Find a for legislation to set wage, benefits, train standards for all security officers in New York City. So that bill is named after our New York City hero, Mr. A lot of Etienne, may he rest in peace. I'll follow the security officer who gave his life off protecting others during a mass shooting in Mental Manhattan. And in my workplace, I'm organizing 32 BJ and my co-workers to organize the union. Not only am I building, but for all 30 buildings, service by my employer. So thank you so much, Madamie. Sarah, what allows family? And when tragedy struck, our security officers in our fight. We got your back. Hello everybody. My name is Alex Graf. I'm an emergency medicine resident physician at King's County Hospital. I'm a proud member of CIRCIU. Every day in the ER, I see patients that come in with preventable, serious medical illness. Metastatic cancer, and a patient who may have been diagnosed early if they had access to primary care. Dehydration due to diabetes in a patient who is rationing his medications and fasting during an insurance gap. A mother with a complex neurologic problem that had to prematurely end her hospital stay because she couldn't get child care. This affordability crisis is literally killing my patients. It is so demoralizing to feel like I've done everything that I possibly can for my patients. But when they leave the walls of the hospital, it will have no impact on their long-term health, because they cannot afford the things they need to live. The billionaire class is gutting the social safety net to line their own pockets. This is going to disproportionately affect working-class community of color and it's a tool of structural racism. That is why we must build a healthcare system that is for people and not profit. And that is part and parcel to electing Zoraan Mamdani as mayor to build a city that we can all afford. Thank you. Good evening fellow New Yorkers. My name is Debbie Boyerman. I'm a social worker at a community mental health center. At my monides hospital in Brooklyn. I'm a proud member and a delegate of 1199 SCI Union. At our last contract negotiations, I helped organize my fellow Union members to show up at the table and we won significant raises, as well as extra pay for social workers who speak a second language. Thank you to my fellow Union siblings and my organizers. Are there any union members and social workers in the house? At my monides, I provide therapy for individuals with mental illness. Zoraan's proposal for a Department of Community Safety can help address the increasing mental health crisis across this city. The police are not trained to work with people experiencing a mental health emergency. We have to keep everyone in our community safe, including the people experiencing a mental health crisis. I've learned as a social worker, individuals living with severe and serious mental illness, like schizophrenia, they deserve and need empathy, connection to long-term housing and social services. Most of the people that we serve at my monides depend on Medicaid for care. So the mental health crisis is only going to get worse after the federal Medicaid cuts kicking if we do not act. I'm proud to say, and if it matters, I happen to be Jewish. Yesterday, I proudly cast my vote for Zoraan Mamdani to help us advance. Thank you. Hello everybody. My name is Zaki. My name is Shazif Yudin. I'm a member of the United Auto Workers or the UAW. Thank you. I'm also a postdoctoral researcher at Wilkornale Medicine. My day job or my research focuses on understanding the impact of the immune cells in our gut and how they can be harnessed to develop new therapies that can improve patients' quality of life. However, for the past two years, my fellow co-workers, my fellow postdocs and I, alongside the UAW, have also been working to get protection, to fight for protections for the international members of our community. And also to demand solutions for the affordability crisis that's plaguing all of us. And we're currently at a place where we might go and strike this week to get the fair contract we need and deserve. Our fight has only grown more urgent this year as the federal government attempts to slash funding for a research institution while simultaneously attacking the international members of our community. Personally, felt these cuts, my job depends on receiving these federal grants, and every single time a thread is made, I'm left feeling uncertain whether I'll receive my next paycheck or whether I'll have the resources to do the critical research that I love. And this is why it is so exciting to have a mayoral candidate like Zoraan Bandani. A person who we know will fight to address the affordability crisis, we are all facing. A person who will defend the right for all immigrant members of our community. And a fellow New Yorker who will stand up with us against this federal administration to protect our city. The UAW was the first union to endorse Zoraan. And if it is necessary to go on the picket lines, we know Zoraan will have our back just like he has in the past. Thank you everybody, and please remember to go out and vote. Hi everyone. First, I want to give some love to people who can visit. Let me hear you if you can visit us. Shout out to my group in Chinatown at noon today. Now I want to hear you if you are a city worker. Hey, in the house. And now, lastly, make some noise if you are an artist or an art worker. My name is June Le. For six years, I have been a member of District Council 37. The union that represents 150,000 workers who run the city. The city where I was born and raised by two working artists. I am the secretary of local 1502 at the Brooklyn Museum where I produced public programs like the beloved, free flagship series for Saturday. This spring, our museum's management attempted to lay off 40 union workers. A reckless reduction in force that would have cut jobs, exhibitions and programs all while preserving six figure salaries for executives. The union strongly opposed. Alongside our sister unit, UAW 2110, we organized rallies and testified to city council who pledged us $2.5 million. With this funding, we saved our jobs. We protected our collections and our visitors, artists, musicians, writers, students and children from Brooklyn and beyond. What I learned, no one but us will save us. We will cut our jobs for executives and safety protocols for art handlers just to hold on to their own power. No more of this. No more. With a new mayor as our ally, we together protect each other. We organize. We unionize. We are the art workers that make New York City a place where everyone can afford to dream and afford to create. It is our future to win. Thank you. Hello. Hi, how's everyone doing today? Hello. My name is Kai Fritz. I am a Starbucks barista. I'm proud union member and New Yorker. And I'm here today because I know that New York is not for sale. And I want to live in New York for workers, not for corporations. Starbucks and its CEO Brian Nichol are the embodiment of corporate greed and oligarchy. Nichol was paid $96 million last year for just 120 days of work. That is 6,666 times what a barista like me makes. His wealth comes at the expense of workers like me. Our healthcare, our rent, our grocery bills. This is a broken system but we are fighting back and we are fighting to win. Starbucks Workers United is one of the fastest growing union movements of this century. Over 12,000 of my union siblings have organized and inspired workers all over the world. And we are not backing down. Our fight for a fair contract is part of a larger struggle for dignity, for justice and for an economy that works for all of us. Not greedy corporations, not billionaires, not oligarchs for all of us. We know Zorhan has our back and we will be with us on the picket line if we strike and we need all of you to join us to. No contract, no coffee. Zorhan's fight is our fight. Workers need a mayor who will take on corporate greed and make this city truly affordable for all New Yorkers. And that is why I am proud to vote for Zorhan on November 4th. Thank you. Who are we? Who are we? Who are we? Yes sir. My name is Curtis Bodie. I'm a proud resident of the products. And most importantly, a proud union member of the hotel, gaming and trade council. A.C.C. My union and I have fought two for now to win the best wages, benefits for hospitality workers. And because of our contract, we was able to thrive through the hardest times. When the pandemic hit and tourism collapsed, my brothers and sisters and I had a lifeline. That contract is set to aspire this July. And everything we work to do from now until the summer is to make sure we are ready to demand the wages, benefits and protection we deserve. This fight will decide the future of 3,000 workers and their families for the next decade. And when so much on the line, we need a mayor to stand with us, not sell us out. That's why I'm proud to stand with my union and supporting Zora Madani for mayor. Whether it's holding hotels accountable to keep working safe and pushing back where Airbnb is spending millions of dollars to take out our homes and our jobs. We will you you will make sure we never go into battle against a bully alone. And Zora knows what it's like to take on bullied. Donald Trump. We see him go against the big guys with all the money, all the power and all the insiders and win. That's the type of ally we need in city hall to stay inside our side with us. When we want to pick a line to behind closed doors, I know New York is getting kind of Zora. Now let us show him we can kind of him and vote next Tuesday for Zora Madani for mayor. Please put your hands together for a visionary leader and fighter for workers everywhere. S.E.I.U. President April Veren. No contract. And I got to do this for the home team. S.E.I.U. I got to do this for the home team. I got to do this for the home team. I got to do this for the home team. I got to do this for the home team. I got to do this for the home team. It was a great day for me. I got to do this for the home team. I got to do this for the home team. when working people anywhere show up for a fight? SCIU gonna damn show show up for the fight, am I right? And make absolutely no mistake about it. Working families across New York City are in the fight for your lives. Pick any issue and it's abundantly clear. Housing, healthcare, childcare, fair wages, working families are being crushed. I don't have to tell you, you live it. But here is what gives me hope. Here's why I had to be with you tonight. Zorin, Mamdani, Donnie, I'm dead, and I knew I was gonna do that. Zorin, Mamdani, gives me hope. He gives me hope because he knows how to fight and he doesn't just fight, he wins. And that is why in just nine days, not only is he gonna win, we are all gonna win when we make him the next mayor of New York City. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you all know, you all know far better than I, there's a lot to love about our dear brothers Zorin. But one of the things that I love about him, he is not just a fighter. He is a believer. He believes in people. He believes that every New Yorker deserves dignity, opportunity, and the chance to lead and live a life of dignity and respect. Yeah. When working people are backed into a corner, he does not look away. He doesn't look away, he looks for a way through. He's the kind of leader who listens when others dismiss us. He's the kind of leader who shows up, even most of the time when others are uncomfortable. He's the one who's gonna stand with the people until victory is won. And he knows, he knows that the cost of living is crushing working people in this city. But here's what makes him different. He doesn't throw his hands up and say, oh, that's just the way it is. He believes something radical. He believes that government can actually work for us. Not just for greedy billionaires, not just for developers, not just for hedge fund managers. He believes it is the people who make this city run and it is the people who should share and the prosperity of this city. Woo! And another reason that I crush on our boys, is somebody saying, oh, you can just call him Z. Another reason that I crush on Z is because he carries a superpower. He carries radical imagination. Radical imagination. That is the courage to believe that better is possible and not just believe it, but have the discipline to organize until you make it real. And he is why. Here's why I get to crush on all y'all too, because he's not the only one with that power. You got it too. It is our inheritance. Radical imagination is. It is the force that carry people through every single crisis, every struggle, every fright for freedom. Radical imagination is what led and slain Africans to dream of liberation when they never knew freedom. Radical imagination is what moved women to demand the rights of vote in a world that told them to stay silent. Radical imagination is what drives workers to strike, to organize, to say no coffee, no contract, to organize the security officers. Radical imagination is our power. It's our legacy. It's our inheritance. And it's ours to make our dreams come true. Is that same power, that same unstoppable force that is alive in this auditorium tonight? Can you feel it? Can you feel your power? Family, our charge in this moment is to remember that power has always, always has rested with the people. And when we organize, we make history. And history does not happen by Osmosis family. It takes work. It takes discipline. And it certainly takes love. It takes love. It takes love for each other. It takes love for your city. That is why, y'all, you got nine days. Nine days to knock every door, nine days to make every call. Nine days to bring every last voter into this movement. So when you leave this rally, get your phones out. Text your friends, call your coworkers. Get on that family thread, hell, call that ex. Yup, I mean it, call that ex. Cause this moment is too important for you not to. And I'll close with this. Zorin, Moundani, will be the kind of mayor that wakes up every morning and works his heart out for you. He who works his heart out for better jobs, for fair pay, for better educational opportunities, for affordable housing, for better healthcare, for quality and affordability, and the protection of our rights and of our democracy. That's leadership, New York. That's the future we can build together. Let's finish strong. Let's go get it. Thank you, President Beret. Keep it going for President Beret. And keep it going for all the workers fighting for better wages and democracy in the workplace. Make some noise if you're a worker. I am also a worker. So please cast me. I will do full frontal. Now please get your minds out of the gutter. I'm also in a union. I am in the screen. Actors guild union. Braggeler, make some noise if you are in a union. Make some noise if you want to be in a union. That's right. Zora and Mom Donnie is the only candidate running for mayor of New York City that actually cares about workers in union. So make a lot of noise for that. Make some noise if you're never going to get tired of making some noise. Workers rock. Stick around. There's a cool video. I'll be back. Bye. Let's see where it's at. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. So much, I think what you encounter in terms of canvassing is not even people being hostile to a candidate. People are really, really, really reticent to put trust in politicians. And I think that canvassing is an opportunity to try to do that trust. Canvass launches that continued in the pouring rain. Strangers who care about those they will never meet. Finding floor after floor of the sixth floor walk up in the rain, in the sun, in the smoke. This for many of you is the first time that you've got involved in politics. The first time that you actually thought, maybe I need to go out on this dreary Sunday evening. No, you came to be surrounded by other folks who are just as energized as you are. All we need is someone with the will and the strength and character to fight for us. People really believe in this man. And I kind of do too. I do kind of. I do. Dreaming demands solidarity. When I look out at this room and out onto the midnight skyline, that is what I see. I do. I do. I do. Our socialists in office from the Democratic Socialists of America, Senator Julius Salazar, assembly members, Claire Valdez, Marcella Martinez, Sarah Hanna's Threatsha, and Emily Gallagher, and city council members, Alexa and Tiffany Coban. Good evening everyone. I am New York State Senator Julius Salazar. In 2018, I became the first Democratic Socialist elected to our state legislature in nearly a century. Before that election, I was in every day New Yorker, like many of you, organizing with my neighbors to demand better from our elected officials. But rising costs and skyrocketing rents were making it harder and harder for working people to stay in our neighborhoods. And I told my fellow DSA members that I couldn't stay on the sidelines. So we launched a long shot campaign that year for the state senate with a promise to fight for everything that working class people deserve. But the odds were against us. My opponent had held elected office for 26 years and he was part of a political dynasty backed by wealthy donors and corporate real estate. We were a scrappy grassroots campaign. Does that sound familiar? But in 2018, we won because we had the power of the people on our side. The establishment didn't take me seriously. Our Democratic Socialist agenda was too radical. It was too radical to win. But together, we proved them wrong. That's right. And we were just getting started. We came right back for more. In 2020, we elected another five Democratic Socialists to the state legislature. Including a guy you may have heard of named Zaron Mamdani to the state assembly. But we didn't even stop there. The following year brought the victories of Democratic Socialist Alexa Amiles. And Tiffany Cabin to the city council. And you know we couldn't stop there. So we kept going and we elected Kristen Gonzales to the state senate. And assemblywoman Clair Baldez. And now we are on the verge of electing Zaron Mamdani to become our Democratic Socialist mayor right here in the largest, greatest city in the country. And now this incredible campaign demonstrates that we not only have the people on our side, but our movement has grown. Is it radical to demand that billionaires finally pay their fair share of taxes? Is it radical to fight to abolish ICE? Is it radical to believe that every family in New York should be able to afford childcare? These are the demands we must make to build the future we dream of into a reality. And now in our next city, are we ready to elect Zaron Mamdani as our next mayor? Are we ready to tax the rich to fund universal childcare? And make our city's buses fast and free. Zaron's vision for New York is one that is affordable and dignified for everyone. Families won't have to choose between childcare and paying the rent where our neighbors aren't punished for speaking out against a genocide in Palestine. On November 4th, we will remind the elite once again that we have the people power and we will give Zaron the mandate he needs to lead our city. And after we secure this election day victory, you can continue to build with us by joining DSA. Thank you all for being in this movement with me. It is now my deep honor to introduce my colleague and comrade assembly member, Claire Valdez. Okay, hello, high queens. Six years ago, I joined DSA because I saw power in our movement. I saw organizers like Julia Salazar and Alexandria Coste de Cortez take on political dynasties and big money and win. And I wanted to be a part of it. And I wasn't alone. I'm standing here with so many of our electeds and we've managed to get across the finish line and grins incredible odds over the years. One of them, not on stage yet, Zaron Mamdani. And it never would have occurred to me six years ago that we would be here, that we would be days away from electing our colleague, our friends, Zaron Mamdani, a democratic social smare of New York City. But here's the thing. Zorndan come out of nowhere. He came out of our movements. Our movement that has been fighting for workers and tenants and immigrants and our trans siblings. Our movement that believes in the richest city in the richest country this world has ever seen no one should go without housing and healthcare. And of course, you know, that's exactly what the billionaires are afraid of. They're afraid of our movement. And that's why Bill Ackman and Whitney Tillson and Michael Bloomberg have spent millions of dollars in this race to so fear and hatred and racist AI slop. Because they think if they can set enough money on fire, they'll win. But I think we know the truth. That New York is not for sale. But my friends, our work is not done and unfortunately it's not even done on November 5th. ours is a lifetime commitment, dividing racism, dividing billionaires, dividing fascism. And if you are here tonight and if you have a knock and gun doors with us, you are part of that movement. So I'm going to make the same ask that my friend just made. Will you take the step I took six years ago and join DSA? We're taking down names. A couple more questions before you go. Will you hit the doors for let's go on Mamdanin? Are you ready to organize, to freeze the rent, make the buses fast and free, win universal childcare and tax the rich? And to quotes another famous socialist mayor, Bernie Sanders. Are you ready to fight for someone you don't know? Hell yeah, let's win this green solidarity forever. You know him, you love him. Please give it up for New York City cop troller, Brad Lander! Good evening New York City! I'm Brad Lander, the New York City controller, also known as your second choice in the primary. That primary gave me a front row seat to see this powerful coalition that Zoran is building and then to become part of it. Watching Zoran up close, I got to see how hungry New Yorkers are for a city they can afford where everyone is welcome and with a leader who inspires us. So when the opportunity to cross indoors arrived, I knew just what to do. For starters, we had to send that corrupt, abusive bully Andrew Cuomo back to the suburbs. I said it on election night and I can't wait to say it again next Tuesday. Good fucking riddance! But our cross endorsement was more than ranked choice math. It also showed the possibility of solidarity. Politics does not have to be the sour selfish ego trip of Cuomo or Adams or Trump. Politics can be a team sport for building the New York of our dreams. That's what Zoran is building and that's what all of us are building. So I want to start by asking how many of you like me are Jews for Zoran? Now you might not think it from the press but you could hear it here. Zoran's coalition includes hundreds of thousands of Jewish New Yorkers. We see in this campaign a way to fulfill Jewish values like Bicellum Elohim that everyone is created in God's image or a havetah at hager that we are commanded to welcome refugees. On primary night Zoran made a commitment to reach out to people who disagree with him. And since then I have seen him keep that promise in dozens of meetings with rabbis and Jewish leaders in house parties, in synagogues at town halls, at Rosha Shana and Yom Kippur services in each one. Zoran listened intently to people's hopes and also to their fears including all two real experiences of anti-Semitism. With patience, with compassion and with a plan he has made it crystal clear Zoran will work to keep Jewish New Yorkers and all New Yorkers safe. Now how many of you are Muslims for Zoran? Assalamu alaikum. I want to speak to you as a Jewish New Yorker because this race especially in the last few days has seen outrageous Islamophobia. For shame, shame on you JD Bats and shame on you Andrew Cuomo. Andrew Cuomo and his billionaire donors have sought to exploit both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia for his political gain. It's gross and we won't stand for it. The Jews and Muslims will not be divided against each other. Our safety, our freedom, our thriving is bound up together. And that's true in New York City and it is also true in Israel and Palestine. Israelis will not be free and safe until Palestinians are free and safe. And that's why even though this is a municipal election, we demand the end to the genocide in Gaza. I am so thrilled that the hostages are home. I met many of their families, many of them. Now the ceasefire must be honored and aid must flow in and a path to Palestinian freedom and peace must be found. We might see different ways of getting there but we won't compromise anyone's humanity. And that includes immigrants coming to our city fleeing violence and war and poverty. This spring, in June when I was arrested at 26th Federal Plaza trying to accompany Eduardo. Zoraan was the first mayoral candidate to show up and demand my release. I've been back every week since this past Thursday I was there for the detention of a 16 year old high school student named Joel. For shame, shame. And I went back to get arrested in civil disobedience again last month along with a lot of you. We will fight Donald Trump by showing up for our neighbors at 26th Federal Plaza or anywhere else he tries to comfort them. We will fight Donald Trump by standing with our attorney general, Tish James. We will fight Donald Trump by saying good riddance to his puppet Andrew Cuomo. And we will fight Donald Trump when we show up in historic numbers with our neighbors, with our friends, with our families to reject his politics of corruption and billionaire rule and a Lexoran Mamdani. The next mayor of New York City. Because it's not Donald Trump versus Zoraan Mamdani. It's Donald Trump versus New York City. With Zoraan as our mayor, we'll show the world that we know what it means to wake up every day with that copper plated statue in the harbor reminding us what it means to be New Yorkers. And that work won't stop at the boundaries of the five burrows. We'll take that fight to Albany to win the resources working people deserve. And we'll take that fight to the halls of Congress where it's more important than ever that we have leaders who understand this moment and who will be partners to Zoraan. Finally, the New York of our dreams won't build itself. We will build it together. So let me see again where the Jews are on. The Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, people who aren't religious, Blacks, Latinos, Asians, Zoraan, LGBTQ. Look around you. This is the New York of our dreams. And now it's on us to make it real. The coalition that won the primary by turning out new voters in historic numbers, you're not half a million doors in those last 11 days. We need to do that now again. To remind those voters there's one more election on November 4th for all the marbles. So, QR code, sign up to Canvas right now. Please, I'm doing it. Please join me as well. Our sages say, call Alam Kulu, Geshire Tsar Ma'od. All the world is a very narrow bridge and the most important thing is not to be afraid. So let's Canvas, let's vote, let's cross that bridge together. Let's elect Mayor Zoraan Mamdani. Let's build the New York of our dreams. Thank you very much. Keep it going for Brad Landr. Okay guys, here's the thing. Brad Landr is really serious about canvassing. Are you? So this is the QR code. This is the QR code. Everybody take out your phone right now. Don't make me be bossy. I see one phone. I know you all take out your phones right now. Take a picture of me. And then take a scan the QR code and I'm not getting off sage until every single person takes out their phone. Does the QR code? I don't know how to do that, but you all do. And sign up for canvassing because how many days do we have left? Are you going to Canvas tonight after this? Right. Is everyone I'm going to wait until you all sign up to canvass. Sing with me. Can you clear up the closing doors please? Hey guys, I wasn't finished singing so you just silenced the female narrative but the wrong. Just kidding. You guys all sign up to canvass. Thank you for doing that. Keep it going for yourselves. I've got an amazing joke for you. A Reverend, a Rabbi, and an Imam walk into the bar and the bartender says, what are you having? And they say, no Cuomo. You guys like that. Okay. Can I get the energy back up? Okay guys, please give a warm not cold, not chilly, a very warm New York welcome to Reverend Charles Galbreath, Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum, and a mod Imam Khaled Lateef. Good evening. My name is Khaled Lateef. I'm the director of the Islamic Center of New York City and a proud member of the Muslim Democratic Club of New York. We are gathered at a time when too many people in our city and in our country are being told that they don't belong. When the language of our politics too often divides rather than unites, when people are made to feel invisible not because of what they've done but because of who they are. Like many of you, I am here tonight not just because my brother is Ahran Mamdani is running but because of what he is running for. We are here not because it is fashionable not because it is convenient but simply because it is right. We are here because the moral fiber of our democracy is being tested. We are here because we refuse to allow the forces of hatred, greed, and fear to have the last word. The vitriol and bigotry that is unsurprisingly and unfortunately spewed itself from commentators, politicians, and political opportunists is the same tired Islamophobic rhetoric that has plagued our nation for decades. They invoked 9-11 recycled anti-Muslim tropes and warned that a Muslim in a position of power poses a threat to our security and our democracy. This isn't new but it is still very dangerous. You have to understand that Islamophobia is not just hate, it's a strategy. What we are witnessing is a deliberate attempt to marginalize and dehumanize. It is used to cast Muslims as perpetual outsiders incapable of leadership unworthy of trust. When Zahran succeeds in the reaction from Andrew Cuomo is to question his loyalty to America, that reveals a deeper ailment. One where identity itself becomes suspect. To be Muslim in America is to know that your belonging is always being questioned. But we are still here and we are not going anywhere. The same forces that target Muslims are also targeting immigrants, the working class, the homeless, black and brown people of all kinds. Really anyone who comes from underserved and underprivileged backgrounds, especially those amongst them who dare to speak truth to power. Islamophobia does not exist in a vacuum, it is entangled with white supremacy, xenophobia and anti-black racism. To me, anti-Muslim sentiment has always been a system of anti-blackness. To those battling hatred in our political discourse, you should know that democracy thrives not on fear but on radical empathy. It demands we trust one another, respect our differences, and elect leaders who reflect our collective identity, not just a narrow majority. And there is no doubt that those who believe in Zahran's leadership come from all walks of life. To everyone who is not a bigot, remember that we are stronger when we include and not exclude. Zahran's victory will not just be a political milestone, it is an invitation to dream bigger, to love braver, and to live up to our city's promise. We do not need to become what they fear in order to defeat them. We simply need to keep showing up with our hearts, our feet grounded, and our collective voice strong and unwavering. This is our city too, and we all belong here. We are here to say that justice is not just a slogan, it is a struggle. That love is not just a sentiment, it is a commitment, that every human being, no matter their faith, their color, their gender, their income, or their immigration status, has infinite value and unshakeable dignity. That affordability is not just about rent checks and price tags, it is about whether ordinary people can live with stability, with joy, with hope, that a democracy that allows corporate greed to dictate who gets a home, who gets health care, who gets to dream. That is a democracy on life supports, we may not have all the money, but we have a movement made up of the people, and when the people move the ground beneath injustice begins to shake. When the people move the walls built to divide us, they crumble. When the people move the impossible becomes inevitable. To my brother Zahran Mamdani, keep showing them who we are by showing them who you are. We are with you every step of the way, and we know that your victory will not just be yours but ours. It will belong to every family fighting to stay in their home, every worker demanding dignity, and every young person daring to dream of a fair world. Because when you rise Zahran, we all rise. When you speak truth to power, you remind us that the moral arc of the universe still bends towards justice, but only when we bend it together. So let's keep bending, let's keep building, let's keep believing. This is our city, this is our moment, and this movement is what New York City should look like. This is the vision of New York City that we love. A Muslim, a Jew, and a Christian stand here supporting this campaign to take our city back. My name is Sharon Kleinbaum, and I'm a rabbi here in New York City who is dedicated to the vision of transforming this city into a place in which all of us live in peace and security and can afford to live in this city. In our Jewish story, read this past Shabbat of Noah after the flood, God says to all of us, I set my rainbow in the clouds as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. Now it is your turn to make sure the earth is taken care of. That rainbow was the first covenant, a promise of life and diversity, a sign that creation itself is holy in all of our colors, a sign that it is up to us to create a future, free of corruption and violence which were told, caused God to flood the earth with the marble, with the flood itself. Our sages then taught in Pirki Avout in the Mishnah that the rainbow was one of the last things that God created. Baynash Mahshot in the tender moment between day and night when light and darkness touch but do not erase each other. That's the spiritual hour New York City lives in all the time between light and shadow, wealth and poverty, despair and hope. And it is in that in between place that holiness is born. Centuries later, two Jewish sons of immigrants, Yip Harberg and Harold Arlen, dreamed another rainbow into being. There was no rainbow in the original Wizard of Oz. In the depths of the Great Depression, they wrote somewhere over the rainbow. From a place of despair and hopelessness, we can imagine the creativity of a rainbow with color and vision and creativity, a vision not of escape but of courage, a world in which people could live free and unafraid, where dreams and justice meet. That dream must be renewed in every generation. And we need leaders like Zoran Mamdani to help us keep imagination and creativity alive to dream of the future and work hard to make it happen. Here in this city of mosques and churches, temples and synagogues, street corner altars, we are each of us called to make that rainbow real. We must make sure we are creating a city which feeds the hungry, houses the unhoused, welcomes the stranger and the immigrant and protects every single child's right to dream. We must be the carriers of that message. We must make affordable this messy creative city of ours. Now I know that I don't agree with our leaders Zoran Mamdani and his in everything that he says, I don't agree with anyone on everything. But we in this city must model what it looks like to hold differences that we can debate and discuss, argue and disagree and stay in relationship. But one thing I know for sure that Muslims and Jews must work together for a shared future of all of us, where the humanity of Palestinians and Israelis have a future of shared security, freedom, dignity and justice. This can only happen when we all are working together with love and respect and on issues related to New York City we completely agree. We dream of a city where Jews and Muslims respect and care for each other. Forcefully as a rabbi I reject all attacks of Islamophobia and hatred of Arabs or of Muslims. This is not my Judaism. This is not my God. Together we must reject all these attacks of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. We need each other. We dream of a city where God's cashier to rainbow bathes all of us in light and justice and in glorious tapestries of differences. And we always pray to remember that joy itself is an act of spiritual and political resistance. As a rabbi I am grateful to Zoran for his commitment to fight anti-Semitism, for his commitment to protect all houses of worship and to take seriously the fear that many Jewish communities live with. We dream of a future and we make it real every day with our passionate commitment rooted in faith, relationships across all kinds of differences and the leadership of Zoran Mamdani to take all of us and our city into a new future. Thank you. Good evening New York. My name is Charles Galbret and I serve as a pastor in Brooklyn, New York. It's Brooklyn in the house. Without a doubt. I serve a congregation that for over 103 years has welcomed immigrants into its doors and into its community. The faces and the places they have come from has changed but we realize they are constantly and consistently looking to dream again. We recognize that many of our folks have been pushed and priced out. Healthcare costs have many people feeling helpless. For far too long their dreams have been deferred, depressed, discounted and just simply dist. But I believe that there is a season coming. A season of recovery in our text it speaks about a brother who was a dreamer. And I believe that there is another dreamer who has a vision for New York City. Who can dream and actualize our way out of food insecurity. Out of housing that's unaffordable. Constantly being underneath a crisis and intimidation to our immigrants. I believe that there is a possibility that rests within our city and rests within our brothers or our mom. In my sacred text there's a story and narrative of Jesus where he sees folks who are hungry. He takes what is there, few loaves of bread and some fish and begins to break it and distribute it to people. It's interesting because the text says he broke it, blessed it, gave it to the folks and everybody ate. I believe it's possible to have a city where everybody can eat. Whether you've been here for two years or 22 years everybody can eat. Whether you ride the five, the two, the one or the A everybody can eat. Whether you live in beautiful Brooklyn, the bustling Bronx, money making, my hat and a statin island or Queens, everybody can. Whether you come from here or from Haiti or from somewhere else, everybody can eat. Let's get together as one so that this entire city can be a place where everybody can eat. These are not just slogans, these are commitments. Everyone should be able to raise a family in New York. We will deliver universal childhood. Change is coming, New Yorkers deserve a city they can afford. We're gonna deliver. It's government's job to make your life better. That's exactly what we are going to do. It's New York's agenda. It's our agenda. All of these concepts are just ideas in the clouds of reaching out the left, so far from Mama Donnie. Join me in welcoming the leaders who will help us bring this home. Governor Kathy Hocal, state senate majority leader Andres Stewart Cousins, and assembly speaker Carl Hayst. Please give a warm welcome to our greatest allies in Albany. Partners in delivering our affordability agenda, speaker of the New York state assembly Carl Hayst. Leader of the New York state senate Andres Stewart Cousins, and governor Kathy Hocal. Here we are, everyone. It is great to see everyone. Tonight, tonight, we are here for one reason. Are you with me? Do you want to elect Soran Mandabi at the next mayor of New York? Well, then I'm in the right place. Because in so doing, in so doing, electing him is our 111th mayor. We will change the course of history. And it needs to be changed. Because right now, I don't mean to take you all down to a dark place. This has been a really uplifting experience. But right now, our city and our state and our country are under attack by Donald Trump and the Republicans in Washington. They are literally not just taking a wrecking ball to the White House. They are taking a wrecking ball to our very values, our people, and our progress. Get this, get this. Donald Trump literally said the shutdown is about killing democratic priorities. Now, what are those priorities? Donald Trump, this is Gisquit's bad. Killing food assistance for babies. Yeah, really sucks. Killing money for seniors to pay their utility bills. Killing healthcare for New Yorkers already struggling to take care of their own lives. It even meant killing planned parenthood until we came in with money to keep it alive. Because they don't give a damn about women in their healthcare and their rights to an abortion. They also killing major infrastructure projects, putting tens of thousands of hardworking union members out of work. Oh, friends, it gets worse. What about the ICE agents flooding our streets as we speak? Canal Street, Queens, the Bronx, their everywhere, and their terrorizing innocent people. And we have had enough. Now, Donald Trump said, oh, we're going after the worst of the worst. The baddest of the bad. They're splitting up families. And let me tell you this, this actually happened. They took away mothers of babies who are nursing them and separated them. This is how cruel they are. Okay. How do you top that? Now, no, it continues. It's going to continue. It's all bad. Now, they're going after our attorney general, Tish James. They go after Tish James. They can come after any of us. But here's what they did not count on. Here's what they did not count on. They always forget this about us. When we get punched, we fight back and we fight back hard. We don't just fight, we win. Because time and time again, New Yorkers have been knocked down, and we get up stronger, louder, and more resilient than ever before. So, I'll be fighting every day with my partners on the same side on restored cousins. And Yars Speaker Carlisle, you get them a round of applause. What's going on? Well, we need something. Here's what we need. All you're fired up. But the three of us can't do it alone. We need a fighter in City Hall who wakes up every day, ready to punch and fight for the work he will the city and that person is Zara Manavi. And this is because Trump's America runs on fear and cruelty and division. But New York, we run on hope and compassion and optimism that never leaves us. So, I say we are the state that does not back down, and I'm going to be working closely with Mayor Zoram Manavi. But you know what? Well, you know what I admire about him so much? Now, think about this. Zoram. Come on. But you know what you should take inspiration from? Think about the fact that every single time people have forced him to endure hatred and threats trying to use his faith for his name as a weapon. You know what he's done? He doesn't get out in the gutter with everybody else. He rises up with grace and courage and grit. That's the kind of leader we need. That's what we need. Because that Islamophobia and bigotry and hate-filled speech, that kind of bullshit doesn't belong in New York. And I see in him someone who sees in New York that is affordable because we want to live here. We want families to grow here, want them to prosper. So we need more housing. But you know what? Here's something I can tell you about personally. New York's first mom governor. We need more child care. And it has to be universal. Child care for everyone who wants it. So here's what we're going to do. Well this crowd is fired up. Alright. I can hear you. But here's my friends. You want to see Zoran or not? Listen, I got one plea for you. I love to see this energy and this passion. And for those of you who have not been involved in the voting or even campaigns before, I am so excited about what is going on here. But I need you to do something. Alright, one more thing. My friend, this is about this November's election. But take that energy, that passion and take it into 26 so that we can take back the House of Representatives, take the Senate and take back our country. What's your help we will? Alex Zoran, we take back America. Thank you, Queens. Thank you, New York. I love you guys. Thank you. Well, good evening everyone. I'm Call Hastie, New York State speaker of the assembly. And I have personally witnessed the profound impact that government can have on a lives of everyday citizens, particularly here in New York. And I come to you today not only is the first black speaker in the history of this state, but someone who calls this great city to home, namely the bookie down Bronx. That's why I'm proud to support my colleague and my good friends Zoran Mandani to be the next mayor of the city of New York. We are living in an era which is too tough when actions speak louder than words. Change makers are taking center stage, determined to bring about necessary transformations that will improve our communities. I need you all to repeat after me. We deserve an affordable city. We deserve affordable city. We deserve an affordable city. We deserve an affordable city. And as a supporter of Zoran, a candidate whose name has become synonymous with the fight for affordability in a city played by high inflation, I am deeply committed to this cause. And I stand behind him today. It's a cause that every single one of us has had to grapple with as we walk the aisles of the grocery store as family speaking, seeking adequate care for their children. In a city run not only run by coffee, but a reliable and accessible public transportation system. We witnessed the stark reality of how many New Yorkers rely on these services with simultaneously struggling to afford these fares. During Zoran's 10 years assembly, I hear you guys. I've collaborated closely with him to prioritize the needs of everyday New Yorkers. Together alongside the assembly majority, we spearheaded initiatives to pilot a free bus route in every borough providing a lifeline for families as they juggle their daily responsibilities. With Zoran as mayor, there's no imagining what we can do together. Now, I need you all to listen to me again. So everybody, Zoran for mayor, Zoran for mayor, Zoran for mayor, Zoran for mayor. Under the leadership of Zoran, he will be the fighter we need in city hall, a beacon of change for communities that have felt unheard for far too long. Affordability would be at the forefront of his agenda, and we can all stand together in witness leadership in action as he worked towards an even better and brighter future for our below city. And don't forget, as we head to the polls, just remember Zoran for mayor. Good evening New York. I love what I'm feeling here. We're going to win this, right? So, we all hear you. Here's what I want to say. I want to say that I remember living in New York City in the housing project, Amsterdam and then part time. I remember having a child and needing daycare. I remember making $7900 a year, and they told me that I was making too much. It was the first time that I had the opportunity, because I was young 20-something, that I stood outside in front of city hall with so many people just like me begging the government to understand that I needed to work to support my child with dignity and to have child care. They didn't hear me. Fortunately, my mother stepped in, so I was able to continue work. This is a story that in 2025 still exists. It is a story of unaffordability for the things that we need every single day. However, we have Zoran. Not only is he about affordability, but you heard the governor, you heard the speaker, and you heard from me. And just as the speaker is his historic figure in the assembly, the governor, the first woman to ever hold the position. And I am the first woman to ever lead a conference in the history of New York State. I bring my experiences with me to the table. And I tell you my experiences so you know that I get it. He gets it. The governor gets it. And I also talk about the history because you are looking at history. Things that people said could never be done. People could never have these seats. They never ever sit at the table and make policy decisions. That's what they would ever believe. And yet, because you vote, we change history. We change lives. We make things happen. It's in your hands. You have the power. One of the things that I was telling Zoran's campaign manager, Maya, you should give her a round of applause. Look where we are. The first time I ran for Senate, I lost by 18 votes. In the longest race in history, they told me February the next year that I lost by 18 votes. And look what happened. But I don't want you to learn from what happened to me. You get out there. Do not rest. Do not stop. Not go in every door. You saw the QR code. Can this knock and get people out there to vote because we don't have another chance. We can't miss this chance. I'm just up north a little bit in Yonkers. But in Westchester, I always help folks. In Westchester, the house, come on. Thank you. Thank you. But what I always say up there is when Democrats vote, Democrats win. But you know what I'm going to be collective. I know there's a lot of people here. A lot of people won't change. So what I'm going to tell you to repeat after me is when we vote, we win. When we vote, when we vote, let's go win. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Governor Hope, speaker, hasty, and leader, steward, cousins. Tax the rich. Tax the rich. That was cool. If you think about it, they were all former co-workers with Cuomo in Albany. And think about how bad you have to be at your job. If all of your former co-workers get together to complain about how bad you were at your job, on stage in a stadium full of people. You guys have been amazing tonight. You're never going to see me again after this. So please get... I know. I know. I know. I really stinks. But our headliners are coming on soon. But before they do, before they do, is everyone scanning the QR code to sign up to Canvas? Okay. On the count of three. I'm going to say one, two, three. Promise I will Canvas, and I will talk to my weird parents and my neighbors to get Zora-Unelected. Okay. You remember all that? One, two, three. You sort of got it. Give it up for yourselves. You guys are amazing. Thanks for coming out tonight. We have some amazing co-headliners. And there's nine days left to go. Do everything you can to make sure we elect Zora-Unmom-Dani with Amanda to make New York City more affordable for all of us. And please give a warm welcome to the Resistance Revival Corridors. Hello everybody. We're here to sing. We are the Resistance Revival Corridors. We got a lot of friends with us on stage tonight. There we go. We're here to sing. We're here to sing. We're here to sing. We're here to sing. We're here to sing. We're here to sing. We're here to sing. We're here to sing. We're here to sing. We're here to sing. We're here to sing. We're here to sing.

And, and, and, and insufficient eroded bygone political establishment, this time in the form of Andrew Cuomo, whose pursuit of power has blinded them from what that power is supposed to be used for in the first place, which is to aid and put the working people of America and New York City first. And, Queen's, both of these challenges are fueled and funded by the same billionaire class whose apparent greatest fear is an equitable, affordable, and prosperous nation and city for all not just the very few. But, we have been here before as a city and a country, and we have won before and we will win again on November 4th. Because, Queen, it has always been in our nation's darkest chapters that our brightest lights emerge. And, we, each and every one of us, whether we like it or not, are living history today. From our nation's beginning, American democracy has always reflected the struggle between humanity's highest and lowest natures, between subjects and citizens, the Confederacy and the Union, freedom, and bondage, labor, and capital rights and regimes. And, it is no different today, the struggle of our time today, the thing is the single most unjust concentration of wealth in the hands of a very few unseen in our nation's history and the world's history. And, it is a time such as this, in which demanding what should be considered the most basic tenets of human dignity, that is considered a radical and outlandish act. It is a time such as today, when demanding affordable housing is considered a radical and outlandish act, that we can afford our lives, our groceries, our transit, is considered an outlandish and radical act, that we accept our neighbor as ourselves, a radical and outlandish act. But, we must remember, in a time such as this, we are not the crazy ones New York City. We are not the outlandish ones New York City. They want us to think we are crazy, we are sane. To demand an affordable and decent housing, a decent wage, the right to healthcare, that we pay to care for our people instead of the flattening of Palestinians and oppressed people abroad is not a radical act, it is basic and core humanity. That is why the election of Zalron is as important as our cause today. Child care, buses, rents and our rights. Here in New York City, it is the jewel and the center of all that is possible in America. And on November 4th, we will prove that today. We will prove it to the world and we will prove it to the nation. And we will send a loud message to President Donald Trump that his authoritarianism is no good here. We will send a message that to ICE, that secret police do not belong here. And we will demonstrate the heroism that exists in the everyday people throughout our city. Heroism like that that we saw last week, a young woman in a polka dot dress standing up to a secret police officer in Canal Street, she is New York City. The young man in a white helmet jumping off his bicycle saying not in my neighborhood, that is New York City. The line cooks and the delivery workers every day serving and making sure that we are clothed and fed and that our children are cared for, that is America, New York City. That is who we fight for, that is what this victory is about. Because New York, America, our freedoms and our future, when I think about what is happening throughout our nation today, and what Donald Trump has even done reflected symbolic of so much in his demolition of the White House. And the East Wing. We see what he is doing to that and we must let him know that this injustice, no matter what he is doing, that House doesn't belong to him New York. It belongs to us, it belongs to the people of this country. And I want us all to remember and to know that the future, our future, is not determined by a death spoke in a house built by enslaved people. Our future will be determined not in a house built by slaves but in a city built by free men, in a city built by unionists, and immigrants, and suffragists. The Bricks laid by working people past, present, and future, the seamstresses and the unionists who paid for our rights in blood. This city was built by the Irish escaping famine, Italians fleeing fascism, Jews escaping Holocaust, Black Americans fleeing St. slavery and Jim Crow, Latinos seeking a better life, Native people standing for themselves, Asian Americans coming together in Queens, in Brooklyn, in the Bronx, in Manhattan, in St. Maryland, in this country, in a vision to build the freest, toughest, and greatest city on earth. And we will not stop now New York. It is no surprise. NYC, baby, NYC. It is no surprise to me, New York, that it is New York, and that it is our great city, that we, our city, have chosen to adorn ourselves with the nation's greatest monument to freedom, the Statue of Liberty. And she reminds us every day that the central commitment of America is an unconditional freedom, precisely of the kind that cannot be bought, that is available to the huddled masses, yearning to be free. This is America, New York City. Don't let them tell you any different. Don't let them tell you that we are the exception, we are the rule, we are the standard, we are the acceptance, and we set the bar for America. I'm talking to you, Donald Trump. There has been a day before his presidency, and there will be a day after. And it belongs to us. Thank you, New York. I love you, New York. You have made my life possible. My mother's life possible. My father's life possible. All of our lives have been made possible by this great city, and by our shared contract and bond to one another. And it is my honor tonight to introduce to you all another great-born New Yorker. From Brooklyn. Senator Sanders and I. Recently came in, we were in Indiana last night. We both paid a visit to the home of the great Eugene Debs. And I had the honor of presenting Senator Sanders last night with the National Eugene Debs Award. In which the foundation and the people who steward Debs' legacy have honored Senator Sanders as the foremost leader and advocate for labor and clash struggle in the United States of America. And it remains such a great privilege and honor to call him a friend, a mentor, a treasured person that we had and a New Yorker. And so I know we all love him so dearly. And so let's make sure that we give him the biggest rousing welcome that he receives this year in introducing Senator Bernie Sanders. Thank you New York. And let me thank the people of New York for sending Alexandria to the U.S. Congress. She is not only one of the great members of Congress, she is inspiring working people and young people all across the country. Thank you New York. Everybody knows that a New York City may as race attracts a lot of attention. That's not new. In the country you have 8 million people, everybody is interested in what happens here. But this may as race, my friends is different. It is not just the folks here in New York City who are paying attention. It's not just people all across our country who are watching this race. It is not just the president of the United States who seems to be very, very concerned about who is the president of the United States. And about who wins this election. The truth is that people all over the world are paying attention to what will happen here a week from Tuesday. So why is that? Why has this campaign created such an unbelievable amount of interest literally all over the world? And the answer is obvious. These are not normal times. This is not a normal election. This election takes place at a moment in American history when we have a rigged economy with more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had in the history of our country. This election takes place at a time when the wealthiest people in America have never ever had it so good while 60% of people in our country are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to pay their rent or mortgage, struggling to afford childcare or higher education for their kids, struggling to afford healthcare, struggling to afford decent quality food, struggling how to figure out how they will retire with some shred of dignity after working their entire lives. This election takes place when the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty and senior poverty of almost any nation. And when in this rich country 800,000 Americans, including many veterans, are homeless. This election takes place at a time when we have a president who has given a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1%. Has given 900 billion in tax breaks to the largest corporations in our country. And to pay for those tax breaks, he is throwing 15 million Americans off the healthcare they have by slashing Medicaid. And in addition, he is forcing over 20 million Americans to see a doubling in their healthcare premiums. This election is taking place when we have an administration in Washington which every day is moving us toward an authoritarian society undermining our constitution and the rule of law. This election is taking place when we have a corrupt campaign finance system which allows billionaires in both political parties to select the candidates they want and to buy elections. Ordinary Americans get one vote, you get one vote, meanwhile billionaires get the opportunity to spend as much as they want to elect the candidates they want. That is the context in which this election is taking place. That is why this election is so enormously important and that is why Zoran Mandani must become the next mayor of New York. New York must have a mayor who represents the working families of this city, not the billion ass less. The reason why this campaign has generated so much interest around the world and so much excitement is that people want to know the answer to one very simple question. And that is in the year 2025 when the people on top have never ever had so much economic and political power. Is it possible for ordinary people for working class people to come together and defeat those oligots? You are damn right we can. Let me tell you something else. At a moment when Americans are extremely distressed about where we are as a nation economically and politically a victory here in New York will give hope and inspiration to people throughout our country and throughout the world. That is what this election is about and that is why Donald Trump is paying attention to this election. Ordinary people working class people black and white and Latino Asian gay and straight coming together to take on the oligarchy that is Trump's worst nightmare. Trump and his oligarchy friends know that if New Yorkers come together and elect Zoran we can do that from California to Maine we can defeat the oligarchy. And what the oligarchs fear what they fear is that people will start understanding that this country belongs to us not them. And all over the country when people are inspired when people are standing up to power they will ask some very simple questions. Why are we in the United States the only major country not to guarantee health care at all as a human right? Why aren't we paying our teachers the salaries they deserve? So that we can have the best public educational system in the world. Why aren't we doing what used to exist in New York and all over this country 70 years ago make public colleges and universities tuition free? Why in the richest country on earth are we ending homelessness and building five million units of low income and affordable housing? Why don't we make it easier for workers to join unions? And why don't we raise the national minimum wage to a living wage? And with so many of our seniors are struggling to cover their basic needs some 22% of seniors in America are trying to survive on $15,000 a year less. Why aren't we raising social security benefits and providing pensions to the workers in this country who doesn't really need them? And why don't we have a foreign policy which does not spend billions of dollars on a netting yaw government starving children in Gaza? In other words, in other words, my friends, in other words, my friends, a victory for Iran will help Americans understand. That in the richest country in the history of the world there is nothing we cannot accomplish. Now the oligarchs and the political establishment in New York tell us that the Iran's agenda for New York is radical. But really, at a time when working families in this city are finding it hard to live here because of the outrageously high cost of housing, I don't think it's radical to say that the city should freeze the rent and trip will at stock of affordable housing. That ain't radical. At a time when working families can't afford the high cost of childcare and psychologists tell us the most important years of human development intellectual and emotional are zero through four. Why shouldn't we have a situation where every child in America gets the best quality childcare we can provide? That ain't radical. Taking care of our kids is not radical. At a time when getting to work is too expensive and we want to encourage more utilization of public transportation, it is not a radical idea to say that buses in this city should be free and fast. At a time when every parent wants their kids eating good quality food, not junk food, and there are neighborhoods in this city where it is simply not affordable or possible to get that food. It is not a radical idea to say that there should be uniscibly funded grocery stores. And by the way, when billionaires and large corporations and the very wealthy are doing extraordinarily well, when the very richest people in this country often pay an effective tax rate lower than truck drivers on nurses. It is not a radical idea to say that the rich should start paying their fair share of taxes. Brothers and sisters, brothers and sisters, these ideas are not radical. They are common sense and they are what the people of New York City want and need. Let me be very clear. As someone who served as mayor of Burlington for eight years, a city just a little bit smaller than New York. I can tell you absolutely that being mayor is not an easy job. In local government, the people hold you accountable for everything. For picking up the trash, for crime problems, for the quality of education that kids receive, for traffic jams, blame the mayor. And that's what mayors have to deal with. And it is not easy. So Ron Mumbani is mayor is not going to have all the answers. The problems facing this country and every other major city in America are in fact enormous. So let me say this to you from the bottom of my heart. When he is elected, your job is not over. Ron, we are going to need your help every single day. In this unprecedented moment in our nation's history, all of us together must act in an unprecedented way. And that means governing New York City and other cities in an unprecedented way. Please do everything you can to work with Ron in order to make him and his administration the best administration in the history of New York. Let me conclude by saying this. And I say this again as somebody who became mayor of Burlington from in 1981 by winning that election by 10 votes after Reckout. Now I have looked at the polls here in New York. You have seen it. And the polls suggest that Ron is in the lead and that is great. But please, please, please do not underestimate our opponents. They have a huge amount of money and they are spending it right now. So I urge you to get about the polls. Go into the last eight days of this election assuming that you are five points behind. So what you guys are going to have to do along with the other 80,000 volunteers in the Bumdami campaign. You've got to do everything that you can to bring people to the polls in early voting, which is taking place right now and on election day. None of us want to wake up the day after the election and find that we lost that election because our opponents outworked us. That must not happen. Brothers and sisters, a year ago, very few people in New York knew about a 33-year-old assemblyman named Siran Mandani. And when he first entered this race for mail, he was polling at all of 1%. Nobody knew who this guy was. But Siran did what people who are serious about real change always do. He created a campaign from the bottom on up by building an extraordinary and unprecedented grassroots movement which now has tens of thousands of volunteers. Unlike his opponents, he didn't go running to the billionaires for campaign contributions. He went to the people with an agenda that made sense to them and despite being outspent four to one, Siran won the primary. Brothers and sisters, with your help over the next eight days, this young man is going to make American history. It is my honor to introduce the next mayor of the city of New York, Siran Mandani. Siran Mandani is the first mayor of the city of New York to be a member of the city of New York. Siran Mandani is the first mayor of the city of New York to be a member of the city of New York. Siran Mandani is the first mayor of the city of New York to be a member of the city of New York. Good evening New York City. How are we all doing? How are you? It is so good to see you all here tonight. Now, as you know, a politician is only as good as the team around him. So, I have to ask that team to start up this teleprompter because right now it's off the top of the dome. And while we wait, why don't we actually begin? Can we first hear a round of applause for our incredible MC, Sarah Sherman? Can we hear it for the elected officials, the labor leaders of the New Yorkers who have joined us this evening? And can we hear it for Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? You know, there are many things one can say about our Congresswoman, but I want to tell you a story about 2021. When we went on a 15-day hunger strike and won $450 million in debt relief for working class taxi drivers. The congresswoman was there with us on that picket line. She was there with us on the phone after everyone else had gone home. And she was there with us again in the primary of this election. And that's because she's there for working people. And now we are just getting started. And let's please make some noise for Senator Bernie Sanders. I stand before you tonight only because the Senator dared to stand alone for so long. I speak the language of democratic socialism only because he spoke at first. And when I ran for state assembly almost six years ago to the day, it was at Bernie's rally in Queens Bridge Park where I led our first canvas. And I'm signing people up for our email list, asking them for five or ten dollars and encouraging them to believe that the politics of not me us applied to our state government just as much as our national one. When we win on November 4th, and then governed from city hall with dignity as the foundation of our politics, it will be because of the movement that Bernie built. And before you tonight as the nominee of a democratic party reinvigorated in its pursuit of making government work for everyone not just the wealthy and the well connected. Looking out at more than 13,000 of you here in Forrest Hill Stadium. It is tempting to believe that this moment was always destined. Yet when we launched this campaign on October 23rd, one year and three days ago, there was not a single television camera there to cover it. When we launched this campaign one year and three days ago, my name was a statistical anomaly in every poll. Once later, as recently as this February, our support had reached the eye watering heights of one percent. We were tied with noted candidate, someone else. I always knew we could beat him. When we launched this campaign one year and three days ago, the political world did not pay it much attention because we were looking to build a movement that reflected the city as it actually is, not just the one that political consultants think exists on a spreadsheet. When we launched this campaign one year and three days ago, we were dismissed as a punchline in the halls of power. The idea of fundamentally changing who government serves in the city was unimaginable. Even if we gained momentum they asked, how would we ever overcome the tens of millions of dollars in attacks that would follow? Yet we knew then what we know now. New York is not for sale. As young people showed up in record numbers, as immigrants saw themselves in the politics of their city, as seniors once skeptical dared to dream again, we spoke with one voice, New York is not for sale. And now, as we stand on the precipice of taking this city back from corrupt politicians and the billionaires that fund them, let our words ring out so loud tonight that Andrew Cuomo can hear them in his $8,000 a month apartment. Let them ring so loud so that he can hear us even if he's in Westchester this evening. Let them ring so loud that his puppet master in the White House hears us. New York is not for sale. 13 days after we announced our candidacy, Donald Trump won the presidency once again. The Bronx and Queens saw some of the largest shifts to the right of any counties in our country. No matter what article you read or channel you turn to, the stories seem to be the same. Our city was headed to the right. Obituary's were written about Democrats' abilities to reach Asian voters, young voters, male voters, again and again we were told that if we had any hope of beating the Republican party, it would only be by becoming the Republican party. Andrew Cuomo himself said that we had lost not because we had failed to speak to the needs of working class Americans, but because we had spent too much time talking about bathrooms and sports teams. This was a moment where it seemed our political horizon was narrowing and in this moment New York you had a choice, a choice to retreat or to fight. And the choice that we made was to stop listening to those experts and to start listening to you. We went to two of the places that saw the biggest swings to the right, Fordham Road and Hillside Avenue. These New Yorkers were far from the caricature of Trump voters. They told us they supported Donald Trump because they felt disconnected from a Democratic party that had grown comfortable with mediocrity and gave its time only to those who gave millions. They told us that they felt abandoned by a party beholden to corporations which asked them for their votes after telling them only what it was against rather than presenting a vision of what it was for. They told us they didn't believe in a system anymore that it not even pretend to offer solutions to the defining challenge of their lives, the cost of living crisis. Brent was too expensive, so were groceries, so was childcare, so was taking the bus and working two or three jobs still wasn't enough. Trump for all his many flaws had promised them an agenda that would put more money in their pockets and lower the cost of living. Donald Trump lied. It was up to us to deliver for the working people he left behind. Over the eight months of the primary, we told New Yorkers how we intended to address that very same affordability crisis. We did not do it alone. This was a movement powered by tens of thousands of everyday New Yorkers who knocked doors between 12 hour shifts at work and phoned banked until their fingers were numb. People who had never voted before became die hard canvases. Community formed. Our city got to know each other and itself. This, my friends, was your movement. And it always will be. As the snow melted in the frost thawed, this campaign began to grow faster than anyone ever imagined possible. So many small donors chipped in that we had to ask you to stop donating. Please stop. We climbed the polls faster than Andrew Cuomo could dial Donald Trump's number. People started to learn how to pronounce my name. And the billionaires got scared. Or as the New York Times would describe it, the Hamptons was basically in group therapy about the mayoral race. Andrew Cuomo and his corporate cronies did everything they could to make this campaign one of fear and one of smallest. They pumped millions into this race. Artificial lengthened my beard to make me seem menacing. Painted our city as a dystopian hellhole and worked night and day to divide the people of New York. They failed. When I walked the length of Manhattan just a few days before the election, hundreds of New Yorkers marched alongside me. And when we strode into Times Square under a billboard with betting odds that showed Cuomo's chances of winning at nearly 80%. And we knew that the so-called experts were set to get it wrong yet again. Andrew Cuomo was supposed to be inevitable. And then on June 24th, we shattered that inevitability. We won by 13%. With the most votes in any citywide primary in New York City history. Some of those New Yorkers had voted for Trump. Many others had never voted before. And when Andrew Cuomo called me to concede at 10.15 that night. He said over the phone that we had created a tremendous force. When you insist on building a coalition with room for every New Yorker, that is exactly what you create a tremendous force. That force has only grown over these past four months. We now have more than 90,000 volunteers. And we have spoken to millions more New Yorkers. We have put forth new plans in these last few months for how we will govern, hiring thousands more teachers for our schools. Taking on the consultants and the contracts in city government. And tackling the final boss of New York City infrastructure. Scaffolding. But over the past few weeks as this race has entered its final days. We have witnessed displays of Islamophobia that shocked the conscience. Andrew Cuomo, Eric Adams and Curtis Leua do not have an agenda for the future. All they possess is the playbook of the past. They have sought to make this election a referendum not on the affordability crisis that consumes New Yorker's lives. But on the faith I belong to and the hatred they seek to normalize. We spent months working to convince the world that New Yorkers have a right to afford this city that we all love. Now we are being forced to defend the idea that a Muslim is even allowed to lead it. These same big money donors and disgrace politicians have sought to rob us of our ambition. Because they do not think that you deserve the beauty of a dignified life. And time and again they have encouraged you to imagine less. Because they know that a reimagined New York hurts their bottom line. I believe that this city is like the universe constantly expanded. We deserve a city government as ambitious as the working New Yorkers who make it the greatest city in the world. We cannot wait for someone else to deliver it. We are not afforded the luxury of waiting because too often to wait is to trust those who delivered us to this point. On November 4th we will set the course of our city back in the direction it belongs. And in doing so we will answer a question that our nation has wrestled with from the dawn of our family. Who is allowed to be free? There are some who hear that question and they know the answer without hesitation. They are the oligarchs who have accumulated vast wealth off those who labor from before the light breaks. The horizon until long after color has drained from the sky. These are the robber barons of America and they believe their money affords them a larger say than the rest of us. I am not just talking about the Bill Akman's and Ken Langones of the world. I speak of people whose names you are not familiar with who have no qualms about contributing more to super PACs than we would ever tax them and who celebrate when those PACs flood our airwaves with commercials that plaster the words global jihad over my face. Their freedom doesn't just come at the expense of dignity and truth. It comes at the expense of the freedoms of others too. They are the authoritarians who seek to keep us pressed beneath their thumbs because they know that once we shake ourselves loose we will never be held down again. Each and every one of these people think New York is for sale. For too long my friends freedom has belonged only to those who can afford to buy it. The oligarchs of New York are the wealthiest people in the wealthiest city in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. They do not want the equation to change. They will do everything they can to prevent their grip from weakening. The truth is as simple as it is non-negotiable. We are all allowed freedom. Each one of us, the working people of this city, the taxi drivers, the line cooks, the nurses. All those seeking lives of grace not greed we all get to be free. And on November 4th thanks to the hard work of more than 90,000 volunteers across every corner of this city. That is exactly what we will tell the world. Because while Donald Trump's billionaire donors think that they have the money to buy this election we have a movement of the masses. And we are a movement that is not afraid of what we believe. And we've believed it for quite some time. Those who worry about what this movement may look like on January 1st are the ones who worried on October 23rd what it may look like tonight. But our purpose has not changed and neither have our promises. As I said on the evening I announced the job of government is to actually make our lives better. And in the exact words I said on October 23rd, here is what we stand for, my friends. We are going to freeze the rent for more than 2 million rent stabilized tenants. And use every resource at our disposal to build housing for everyone who needs it. We are going to eliminate the fair on every single bus line and make what are currently the slowest buses in the nation move around this city with ease. And we are going to create universal childcare at no cost to parents. And all New Yorkers can raise their family in the city they love. Together New York, we are going to freeze the together New York we are going to make buses fast and together New York we are going to deliver our universal. We will make our city one where every person who calls it home can live a dignified life. No New Yorker should ever be priced out of anything they need to survive. And we believe then we believe today we will believe tomorrow that it is government's job to deliver that dignity. Dignity my friends is another way of saying freedom. Standing before you this evening I take great strength from those who have labored mightily for the cause of freedom in America who refused to accept that government could not meet what moments of crisis demanded from them. When the power of the people overwhelms the influence of the powerful there is no crisis that government cannot meet. It was government that enacted a new deal to lift a generation out of poverty to create beautiful public goods and establish the right to unionize and collectively bargain. My friends the era of government that deems an issue too small or a crisis too big must come to an end. Because we need a government that is every bit as ambitious as our adversaries. A government strong enough to refuse the realities we will not accept and forge the future we know we deserve. A government that refuses to accept one in four New Yorkers living in poverty. That refuses to accept more than 150,000 public school students being homeless. That refuses to accept that two union salaries are not enough to put down a mortgage in this city. A government that refuses to accept you being priced out of the very city you helped to build every single day. Time and again our nation has teetered on the precipice of hopelessness. Now is one of those times but in each of these moments working people have reached into the darkness and reshaped our democracy. No longer will we allow the Republican Party to be the one of ambition. No longer will we have to open a history book to read about Democrats leading with big ideas. My friends the world is changing. It's not a question of whether that change will come. It's a question of who will change it. We have an opportunity before us that you have ever received and even fewer have ceased. It's the opportunity to show the world what it means to win freedom. It is the opportunity to live up to the legacy left by those who came before. We do not get to determine the scale of a crisis. Our choice is how we respond. Let us win a city hall that works for those straining to buy groceries, not those straining to buy our democracy. Let us look forward to January 1st when the hard work of governing will begin. Those in power would like to describe our policy commitments as if they are illusions that will evaporate as soon as we approach city hall. Let us show them instead that they are invocations of the future that we will win. And let us prove to each and every New Yorker that a politics of expansion does not just mean imagination. It insists upon fulfillment. We can make city hall a place where New Yorkers come to expect the future, not just failure. But we are not there yet. Just as Andrew Cuomo's victory in the primary was thought to be inevitable, the same narrative it started to form around us today. When you read the articles that tell a post-election story of triumph while we are amidst early voting, when you see the kalshi odds that have our chances of victory in the 90s, know this. You are reading the same things that Andrew Cuomo read when he went to sleep each night in June, believing that his victory was promised. We cannot allow complacency to infiltrate this movement. So over these nine final days, I ask for only one thing from each of you. More. I know you are tired. And for that, I recommend some Adhani Chai. And still, I ask for more. I know the attacks have intensified that a warm bed is more inviting than a six-floor walk-up, that another evening spent knocking doors after a long workday feels daunting. And still, I ask for more. I ask for more because that is the only way that we win a future of more. So if you are able, I urge you my friends, stand up. If you have knocked a door, turn your flashlight on. If you have more to give, turn your flashlight on. Together, let us make a light bright enough to banish any darkness. Over these final nine days and the months and years that follow, the powers that be will throw everything in their arsenal against us. They will spend millions more dollars. They will attack us from every conceivable angle. But we will not bend. We will not flinch. We will triumph over the oligarchs and we will return dignity to our lives. Nearly 89 years ago to the day, FDR spoke before a crowd of thousands at Madison Square Garden.

I should like to have it said of my second administration that in it, these forces met their master. My friends, I should like to have it said of our campaign that in it, the forces of selfishness and lust for power met their match. And I should like to have it said of our city hall that in it, these forces met their master. New York, our work has only just begun. On November 4th, we set ourselves free. Thank you. Thank you.

        "transcript": " God bless the great state of Wisconsin. What an incredible victory tonight and thank you to your tremendous Governor, Governor Scott Walker for his principal passionate leadership. Tonight is a turning point. It is a rallying cry. It is a call from the hardworking men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America. We have a choice, a real choice. The national political terrain began to change two weeks ago. In the state of Utah, we won 69% of the vote, a landslide election. Winning every single delegate in the state. Then just three days ago in Colorado, two congressional districts voted. Once again, they elected six delegates and of those six delegates, we won all six. And then two days ago in North Dakota, we had another tremendous win. They elected their delegates, of the delegates who specified their support. 18 are supporting our campaign. One is supporting Donald Trump. 18 to one, I'll take that ratio any day of the week. And now tonight here in Wisconsin. A state that just three weeks ago, the media had written off a three weeks ago, the media said Wisconsin was a perfect state for Donald Trump. But the hardworking men and women of Wisconsin stood in campaign tirelessly to make sure that tonight was a victory for every American. For very different states, Utah, Colorado, North Dakota, Wisconsin for victories. So just how significant is tonight? Well just today, our campaign has raised over two million dollars. People all over the country go into Ted Cruz dot org. Contributing $10 or $25 or $50. We've had over 1.3 million contributions. In the last two weeks and in the coming days when Colorado and Wyoming finish voting, we are likely to have gained over 100 delegates on Donald Trump. And as a result of tonight, as a result of the people of Wisconsin defying the media, defying the pundits, I am more and more convinced that our campaign is going to earn the 1237 delegates needed to win the Republican Army. Either before Cleveland or at the convention in Cleveland, together we will win a majority of the delegates and together we will beat Hillary Clinton in November. Tonight was a bad night for Hillary Clinton. It was a bad night in the Democratic primary and it was an even worse night for her in the Republican primary. We are winning because we are uniting the Republican Party. Of the 17 candidates who started this race, a terrific, talented, dynamic field, five have now endorsed this campaign. And, James Perry, and Lindsey Graham, and Jeb Bush, and Carly Fierena, and Wisconsin's own governor Scott Walker. Can you toss in Senator Mike Lee and Mark Levin? We've got the full spectrum of the Republican Party coming together and uniting behind this campaign. In 1960, accepting the Democratic Party's nomination, John F. Kennedy observed, I think the American people expect more from us than cries of indignation and attack. The times are too grave, the challenge too urgent, and the stakes too high to permit the customary passions of political debate. We are not here to curse the darkness, but to light the candle that can guide us to see through that darkness to a safe and sane future. As Winston Churchill said on taking office, if we open a quarrel between the present and the past, we shall be in danger of losing the future. The same is true today. Tonight, Wisconsin has lit a candle guiding the way forward. Tonight, we once again have hope for the future. Tonight is about unity and tonight is about hope. Young people in America once again have hope that we will bring jobs back to America. By repealing Obamacare, passing it, reigning in the federal regulators that are killing small businesses, passing a flat tax, and abolishing the IRS. We will unleash incredible economic growth. Our border will finally be made secure, and sanctuary cities will end. We will once again see wages rising, opportunity expanding. Working moms, struggling to make ends meet, will see take home pay rising, the cost of living, falling, and common core ending. Catholic schools and Jewish day schools, Brigham Young and the little sisters of the poor, will see a Supreme Court that protects their religious liberty. The fundamental freedom of every one of us to live according to our faith and our conscience will see a Supreme Court that protects the Second Amendment right to keep in their own. And our fundamental right to protect our families and our homes and our children. We will see a President who stands with Israel. Clearly and unapologetically, instead of negotiating with terrorists, we'll rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will utterly destroy ISIS. Who keeps us safe? To the soldiers and sailors, the airmen and Marines, to the police officers and firefighters and first responders who risk their lives every day to keep us safe, we will have a commander in chief who has your back. Jobs, freedom, and security, that's what this next election is all about. In 1980, Milton and Rose Friedman wrote, free to choose. They explained that the American Free Enterprise System has been the greatest engine for opportunity and prosperity that the world has ever seen. Too much government can stifle opportunity. But if we get Washington out of the way, then there is no limit to what we can account. It's what allowed my dad to escape Cuba and come to America with nothing washing dishes making 50 cents a day to start a business and today to be a pastor traveling the country. It's what allowed my Irish Italian mom to become the first center family to go to college to smash glass ceilings by becoming a pioneering computer programmer. It's what allowed my wife Heidi. I may be biased, but isn't she going to make an amazing first lady? She's the child of missionaries. My best friend in the world and she's become a successful business leader, a loving mom. And every day she's teaching our daughters Caroline and Catherine that strong women can accomplish anything in the United States. It's America. It's what we're fighting for, our children, our future. And Wisconsin is made clear. We are free to choose. For centuries America has been a shining city on a hill, a beacon of liberty to the world. And we can and will be once again. So I ask you at home to join us as we continue to unite Republicans and Independents and libertarians and Reagan Democrats and Americans who care about our future who want jobs, freedom and security. And now as we've done in Wisconsin we're doing all across this country. And Governor let me tell you, I look forward to coming back to the state of Wisconsin this fall. And in November for the first time since 1984 painting the Badger State bright Republican red. So let me just say Hillary get ready here we come.",

Tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives across Iowa and all across this great nation. Tonight the state of Iowa has spoken. Iowa has sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media. Will not be chosen by the Washington establishment. Will not be chosen by the lobbyists. But will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force where all sovereignty resides in our nation by we the people, the American people. Tonight thanks to the incredible hard work of everyone gathered here. Of courageous conservatives across this state, we together earn the votes of 48,608 islands. To put in perspective your incredible victory that you have won tonight. That is the most votes ever cast for any Republican primary winner. Tonight is a victory for millions of Americans who have shoulder the burden of seven years of Washington deals run amok. Tonight is a victory for every American who is watched in dismay as career politicians in Washington in both parties refuse to listen and too often fail to keep their commitments to the people. Tonight is a victory for every American who understands that after we survive eight long years of the Obama presidency that no one personality can write the wrongs done by Washington. Millions who understand that it is a commitment to the Constitution to our shared insistence that we rise and return to a higher standard, the very standard that gave birth to the greatest nation that the world has ever known. Tonight is a victory for every American who is watched in dismay as career politicians in both parties refuse to listen and too fail to keep their commitments to the revolutionary understanding that all men and all women are created equal. Tonight is a victory for every American who is watched in dismay as career politicians in both parties refuse to listen and too fail to keep their commitments to the Republican primary winner. And the federal government's role, the federal government's responsibility is to defend those fundamental rights, to defend us. And while Americans will continue to suffer under a president who has set an agenda that is causing millions to hurt across this country, I want to remind you of the promise of Scripture. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy come within the morning. Tonight Iowa has proclaimed to the world morning is coming. From day one, this campaign has been a movement. From millions of Americans across this country to organize, to rally, to come together, whatever Washington says they cannot keep the people down. And tonight is a testament to the people's commitments, to their yearnings, to get back to our core commitments, free market principles, constitutional liberties, and the Judeo-Christian values that built this great nation. When the Washington lobbyists settled on other candidates in this race, when the media in one voice said a conservative cannot win, nationwide, over 800,000 contributions poured in to TedCruz.org as courageous conservatives said yes we can. 800,000 contributions at TedCruz.org with an average contribution of $67. That is the power of the grassroots. But it's more than that, it's 12,000 volunteers here in the state of Iowa. It's over 200,000 volunteers all across this great nation.",

        "transcript": " Thank you so very much, Carly, for your incredible friendship and leadership. God bless New York and God bless the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I'm so excited to share with you what America has learned over the past few months, and it has nothing to do with a politician winning his home state tonight. It has everything to do with what we've seen in the towns and faces that have been weathered with trouble, joblessness and fear. It's what we've learned looking at the factories that have been shuttered and the hearts that are closing. We have learned that America is at a point of choosing. The media will say it is about choosing a president, but it really isn't. Our real choice is personal, and every generation must make the same choice. Will we continue to live in the past with what we know no longer works or will we move forward to a new and better place? The people in state after state have made it clear. They cry out for a new path. This is the year of the outsider. I'm an outsider. Bernie Sanders is an outsider. Both with the same diagnosis, but both with very different paths to healing. Millions of Americans have chosen one of these outsiders. Our campaigns don't find our fuel in bundlers and special interests, but rather directly from the people. The wide-eyed youth of any age that haven't given up on the hope that tomorrow can and will be better. Ronald Reagan and Jack Kennedy were outsiders. They both represented a whole new vision and vibrancy, a new generation of ideas. Jack Kennedy looked forward, instead of back to the first half century of World War. He knew that America could dream and build if we were set free. Not tanks for war, but rockets for exploration. Reagan looked out to us the most powerful force for innovation that the world has ever known. There we found new tech pioneers like Bill Gates, had a young Steve Jobs. They had vision and the freedom to build a new world that at the time only they saw because they were free. They challenged the way and changed the way that all of us live, work and interact. Now it's our turn. This generation must first look inward to see who we really are after years of being beaten down. Those of us who are being told we couldn't, shouldn't or wouldn't. This generation needs to answer a new set of questions. Can we? Should we? Will we? Are we still those people, those dreamers and doers? Are America's greatest generations in our past or are best days yet ahead? We must unite the Republican Party because doing so is the first step towards uniting all Americans. The question is not whether all Americans can or will agree on a majority of issues all of the time. The question is whether a majority of Americans are hungry to rally around a set of principles larger than any single issue that a politician may use to divide us. Tonight I'm speaking to you from Philadelphia. It's natural when we talk about our nation's earliest days that we focus our attention on the declaration of independence and the Constitution. And we can learn a great deal about a path forward by focusing on the passionate disputes and disagreements among our founding fathers. Differences that were put aside only because of the weight and consequences of the foundational principles they sought to proclaim and the price to be paid if they failed to rise to the task. Today, as Republicans, we agree on a lot. And sure, areas of lesser agreement exist as well. But on the fundamental question, are we satisfied with the current direction of our country? We speak with one voice. I call on you, as JFK did in the 60s and as Reagan did in the 80s, to chart a new American journey forward, one that isn't led by me or anyone in Washington. One that is not by you and millions others just like you. One where we still have differences yet we choose to concentrate on what we have in common. One that lifts others up and believes in the rights, responsibilities, goodness and the strength of all mankind. We have so much that binds us together. Our families, our work ethic, our ability to dream and build unlike any people in history. But most of all, our charity, our love for our fellow men and women and our willingness to sacrifice for those in need. Let us unite on the things that have always made us great. We are great because we are good. Because over and over again we have chosen courage in the moment of crisis. Freedom in the face of compromise and hope in the face of challenges that everyone told us could not be overcome. Our sitting president ran on a slogan that should have been a great first step. He promised us, yes we can. Now is the time to take that slogan and put it into action. Yes we can was a recognition of the hope that we can and should recover. The problem was that Barack Obama's prescriptions only led to more elitist control from Washington and less freedom for the people. But now is the time as Americans once again to reclaim that hope. To take another giant leap for mankind. To speak the words with all the power and might that we can muster and use the words that have changed the world time and again. The words that the slaves yearn to hear from the American people and Abraham Lincoln when they cried out for freedom. The words that Europe and Britain heard when they cried out for help defeating totalitarian evil in the 1940s. The words that led two men in North Carolina to be the first in flight. And a half century later the first man to reach the moon. And decades later two men in their garage to come up with Apple. They are the words that will repair our tattered spirit. Lift up our economy and those who are barely making it. They are the words that will vanquish the evil of ISIS and return the rule of law. They are the words that when Americans come together and say with conviction they change the world. They are the vision of this campaign. Not yes we can, but now yes we will. We will restore our spirit. We will free our minds and imagination. We will create a new and better world. We will bring back jobs and freedom and security. We will find new ways to ignite an energy revolution with more jobs and greater choices. We will defeat the evil of Islamists and ISIS. We will live as neighbors, friends and family in peace once again. We will heal the sick, feed the poor and defend the defenseless. We will restore our rightful place in the world. We will do what Americans do best. We will live for others. We will change the world through the hope of freedoms enduring promise and our unrelenting spirit. You can be empowered. And in a digital age it is all the easier for your individual voice to be heard. Your choices to govern your work, your education, your future. If only Washington will get out of the way. Join me now on this journey of less talk and more action, real solutions because I know you. You may have been knocked down, but America has always been best when she is lying down with her back on the mat and the crowd has given the final count. It is time for us as a nation to get up, to shake it off and be who we were destined to be. Don't let anyone try to convince you otherwise. Here is the truth. You don't need me or any politician. But we do need each other, all of us. Coming together as one as we the people, because not only do we say yes we can, beginning here and now we pledge to each and every one of us. Yes, we will. And now my friends, onward to victory.",

That is the power of the grassroots. But it is more than that. It is 12,000 volunteers here in the state of Iowa. It is over 200,000 volunteers all across this great nation. You know, during the course of this campaign, people have asked, tidy in me, are you tired? And I will admit, it is 16, 18 hours a day, 6, 7 days a week. We are not tired at all. To the contrary, we are inspired by each and every one of you. I leap out of bed every morning, amazed that at a time when our country is in crisis, every one of us has the opportunity to stand and lead that we have been put in a place of leadership for such a time as this. I am inspired by the stories of heroism that I see every day, working men like Jerry Dunlavy from Columbus, Ohio, who requested an entire month off his job to come to Iowa to live at Camp Cruz and to volunteer full time. When his employer refused to give him the time off, Jerry quit his job and came anyway. I love the great state of Iowa. I am inspired by people like Elliott Gayser and Josh Hammer, students at the University of Chicago, who spent their winter break at Camp Cruz. But they didn't stop there, they came back this weekend, they hit the phone and they hit the pavement campaigning so that students across this country, upon graduation, rather than having mountains of debt, will instead have two, three, four, five high paying job offers and a chance at the American Dream. I am inspired by people like Alexandra Ziegler, a 13-year-old girl from Lubbock, Texas, who yesterday at our campaign headquarters made 823 volunteer calls. That has always been the strength of this campaign. Are the men and women gathered here in courageous, conservative, standing up and speaking out and lifting us up in prayer, lifting this country up in prayer each and every day. Let me say our leadership team, our Iowa State Chairman Matt Schultz, what an extraordinary job. You have done organizing a grassroots army and let me say to our Iowa State Director Brian English, what an amazing job Brian has done. And to our national co-chairman Bob Vanderplot and Steve King. These men have become dear and trusted friends. They are warriors, they are men of principle, they stand and speak the truth, they stand to defend their values and let me tell you these leaders. Day after day, week after week have been crawling under broken glass with knives between their teeth. I am grateful for the support, the early support of my friend Steve Deice. We are grateful for the over 150 pastors across the state of Iowa who joined our team to energize people of faith. We are grateful to the state senators, to the state representatives, to the volunteer leaders in each of the 99 counties who stood up and said, we will be heard and this will be decided by the grassroots. And then I am so grateful to national leaders, people like Dr. James Dobson. And Tony Perkins. And Phil Robertson. And Governor Rick Perry. And Glenn Beck. And I am so grateful to the state representatives, leaders who have stood and led, bringing together and coalescing conservatives here in Iowa and all across the country. You want to know what scares the Washington Cartel? Actually not remotely. But I want to scare them in the tiniest bit. What scares them is you. What scares them is that the old Reagan coalition is coming back together of conservatives. We are seeing conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and Reagan Democrats all coming together as one and that terrifies Washington DC. And so to the people of Iowa, Heidi and I say thank you for your incredible hospitality. Thank you for your love. Thank you for welcoming us into your homes, into your living rooms. Thank you for welcoming my father to preach from the pulpits of your churches. And let me say to my parents, mom, thank you for the incredible unconditional love that you have given me every day of my life, the knowledge that whatever I might do, whatever I might say that my mother loves me. To my cousin, baby, who is like a sister to me, we grew up together. I love you, babes. And to my dad, a man who came from Cuba at age 18 with nothing, with $100 in his underwear. He doesn't carry money in his underwear anymore. A man who was imprisoned, who was tortured, who washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour, who has lived the American dream, and a man who is today a pastor traveling the country preaching the gospel. My dad is 76 years old and yet he's got the energy of a teenager and dad, you have been my hero my whole life. I love you dad. When the sun rises tomorrow, this campaign will take the next step. We will continue to campaign the same way, sitting down person to person, leader to leader, VFW Hall to Duncan Donuts returning to the great state of New Hampshire. Let me speak for a minute to the men and women of the state of New Hampshire. 36 years ago, you welcomed to the Granite State, a candidate running for president who was also deeply disliked by the Washington establishment and the Washington cartel. You were a candidate who had been dismissed outright by the media. Some polls had him 15 to 20 points behind. But you refused to let the establishment and cartel and the media do your thinking for you. You refused to let them tell you how to vote. You wanted a candidate who didn't adopt his positions because of the latest opinion polls. But instead because of a deep and underlying conservative philosophy that grounded him so that he knew exactly what he believed exactly what the principles were that built this great nation. So tonight I want to say to the people of New Hampshire, thank you for what you did 36 years ago. Thank you for giving America and the world and yes history itself are 40th president of the United States, Ronald Wilson Reagan. And I ask the people of New Hampshire and the people of South Carolina and the people of Nevada and the people of the Super Tuesday states on March 1st to each of you do not listen to our words. Do not listen to the rhetoric from campaigns but rather hold each and every one of us accountable, hold me accountable and hold every other candidate accountable to be a consistent conservative. If you want a candidate to repeal Obamacare then support a candidate who has led the fight to repeal Obamacare. If you want a president to stop Amnesty to secure the borders and keep us safe then support a candidate who has led the fight to stop Amnesty to secure the borders and to keep us safe. If you want a candidate to support life and marriage and religious liberty then support a candidate who has spent decades of his life fighting to defend life and marriage and religious liberty. If you want a candidate to defend the Second Amendment right to keep in bear arms then ask of every candidate where were you in the spring of 2013 when Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer tried to undermine the Second Amendment right to keep in bear arms. If you want a candidate who will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel then support a candidate who has led the fight over and over again to stand by our friend and ally the nation of Israel. And if you want a commander in chief who will fulfill the most solemn obligation of the president to keep this nation safe then support a candidate who has demonstrated the commitment, the judgment, the experience, the clarity of vision to identify our enemy to call it by its name radical Islamic terrorism. And to utterly and completely defeat ISIS. If I am elected president every militant on the face of the planet will know if you go and join ISIS. If you wage jihad on the United States of America, if you attempt to murder innocent Americans you are signing your death warrant. And I will tell you this, if the other states across the country follow the lead of the good men and women of Iowa and support this campaign then I will tell you this, this July in Cleveland. You will hear these words spoken from the podium of the unified Republican convention. Tonight I want to say to every member of the Democratic Party who believes in limited government in personal opportunity in the United States Constitution and a safe and secure America. Come home. To the Reagan Democrats, your party has left you. And the Republican Party wants you, we welcome you back. Because together this year Republicans and the Reagan Democrats can send an unmistakable message. The message of a Reagan-like landslide that once and for all will drive the liberal elites and the Washington cartel into the Potomac and out to see never to be seen again. Together we can bring out a new era of economic growth, of military strength, of international security and the future of hope that our children deserve. If we commit to do more than hope, if we aspire to govern by a higher standard, a standard that transcends political party and race and gender and income and to everyone that is tired of a president that divides us daily on racial lines, on ethnic lines, on religiously. On gender lines, on socioeconomic lines. We will have a president that once again seeks to bring us together and unite us on our shared values of who we are as Americans. The most solemn responsibility of the president is to keep this country safe. And we will stop the weakness and appeasement. We will stop making excuses for global bullies and terrorists and rather simply do what it takes to defeat them. I give you my solemn promise. We will finally, finally, finally secure the borders and end sanctuary cities. I want to speak for a moment to the soldiers and sailors and airmen and Marines. I want to speak to the moms and dads who have a child serving overseas. I want to speak to the husbands and wives who wake up at night wondering if their loved one is still alive. I want to speak to the little kids who have been waiting months upon months to get a hug from daddy, a kiss from mommy, to all of our fighting men and women who have been sent into combat with their arms tied behind their back, with rules of engagement that are wrong, that are immoral, that will end in January 2017. You will have a commander in chief who finally has your back. And to the police officers and the firemen and the first responders, the heroes who rushed into burning buildings instead of out of burning buildings. The last seven years of having a president, having an attorney general that demonizes you, that vilifies you, that sides with the criminals and looters instead of the brave men and women of law enforcement, that will end on January 20, 2017. So tonight, the state of Iowa, the Democrats here, seem to be in a virtual tie between one candidate who admits he's a socialist and the other candidate who pretends she's not. I wish them both luck, but I will tell you this as Margaret Thatcher observed the problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other people's money. And let me tell you tonight, I cannot wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton. We will win by speaking the truth with a smile. The truth is the American people are fed up with Washington with a corrupt class that enriches itself and leaves behind the working men and women of this country. The truth is the American people are fed up with a federal government that views the bill of rights and the Constitution as a rough draft, as an inconvenience, as something to be set aside and we are ready to get back to the vision of the framers of protecting the unalienable rights given to each of us by our creator. The reason all of you are here is the same reason I am here. It's the same reason Heidi and I have spent every waking moment for the last year. We love our kids. Our girls Caroline and Catherine at age 7 and age 5. Every one of us here, when we go to bed at night, we think what kind of world are we leaving our kids? Are we giving our children a brighter future? What are our parents gave us? A country with greater freedom, greater opportunity, more promise, more hope. You want to know why I am getting on a plane in about an hour and flying all night to New Hampshire, to knock on doors and sit down and visit with people and ask for their support. The reason is simple because when I look my girls in the eyes 10, 20 years from now, I am not going to tell them we could have stood up and saved this country. But we didn't do everything we could. Instead, I am going to tell them millions of Americans saw that America was in jeopardy and we rose up together and said we are going to preserve this nation for our children and grandchildren. To those who supported other candidates in this race, the Republican Party is so blessed to have a bounty of talented young dynamic candidates, people who are friends, people who I like and respect. To those who supported other candidates, I will tell you each of them we welcome you as part of our team. Because if we stand together as one, if the American people stand together and say we want our country back, there is no force in Washington that can stand against the American people that can stand against the grassroots that can stand against our unity, we are going to do this together as a movement from the people. And I tell you tonight Iowa has made clear to America and the world. Morning is coming. Morning is coming. Thank you and God bless you.",

        "transcript": " Unido para elegir a la siguiente presidente de Estados Unidos en noviembre. ¡Qué Dios les ventica! ¡Favor de darle desinvenida al Senador Chuck Schumer de Nueva York! ¡Hola, Nueva York! ¡Los quiera mucho! Ahora, hay una estatua en la Bahía de la Ciudad que representó. Una mujer firme con un antorcha. Y para mí es antorcha representa el sueño estadounidense. Y si uno le pregunta el estadounidense promedio, ¿qué significa ese sueño? ¿Sensivamente dirían si trabajo esmeradamente me va a ir mejor en 10 años que me va a hoy y mis hijos les irán a un mejor que a mí? Cada generación que necesitan mantener brillante es antorcha. Es la fuente de nuestro optimismo. Es lo que hizo el presidente Obama luchando todos los días para defender esa esperanza fundamental estadounidense. Pero hay más trabajo que hacer para nosotros. Los ingresos de la clase media no han crecido y muchas familias luchan para mantener su presupuesto. Y la antorcha no va a ser tan brillante con eso y su esperanza tan potente se va a ir apagando. Y algunas personas quieren poner estadounidense contra estadounidense. Nosotros luchamos para un estadounidense que lucha para todos, que quiere anivilar el campo para todos nosotros. Y cuando Hillary Clinton gana la casa plata y los demócradas ganan la mayoría del senado, eso va a ser justo lo que vamos a hacer. Los señores, mis amigos, Hillary entiende lo que las familias de clase media necesitan más que cualquier persona. Yo sé porque conozco a Hillary trabajé con ella 8 años como sendar audres juntos representamos el gran estadounidense de Nueva York. Ahora señores, yo vengo de Brooklyn. Corre en nuestra sangre para entender lo que es la basura. Hay mucho de eso en la política, pero no con Hillary cuando ella les dice algo, ustedes pueden confiar en eso. Yo lo vi su capacidad remarcada de poder escuchar y canalizar los sueños, los temores y las preocupaciones de los estadounidenses comunes. De trabajar estvenadamente, escuchó al trabajador de la fábrica, desquenéctedí y al escuchar que su fábrica se iba del país. Y ella les enfrentó a los dirigentes de la fábrica hasta que ellos cambiaran de opinión y escuchó a los que llegaron después del 9-11 a los escombros que buscaban las señas de vida entre el humo y los apórestos tóxicos. Y ella luchó para conseguir el cuidado médico que ellos merecían y lo consiguió para ellos. Esos señores es el liderazgo que este país necesita y lo que está en juego no podría ser más. La mayoría de las elecciones son dos diferentes versiones, visiones para América. Esta elección se trata de dos diferentes visiones de América. Y Donald Trump solo me te ve un Estados Unidos que miedoso, que crítico, Hillary ve otro Estados Unidos que se esmera para vivir la promesa, escrita aquí en Estados Unidos que todo hombre, todo mujer tiene el derecho a la vida, libertad y seguir buscando la alegría. Y en Estados Unidos no edificamos muros, nosotros rompemos techos de cristal y nosotros construimos puentes más firmes y fuertes juntos. Hillary Clinton tiene la visión correcta de y para América, pero mis colegas y mis colegas del Senado van a estar de acuerdo conmigo. Ella no lo puede hacer sola, ella va a necesitar una mayoría en el Senado del Estados Unidos. Una mayoría en el Senado que coloca un nuevo juez de la corte suprema en la y va a proteger los derechos de votantes y va revocar la decisión de Siris Encionainen y proteger los derechos de la mujer. Y a Olsar en el Senado el sueldo mínimo y reformar globalmente la migración en invertir en la infraestructura y dar la oportunidades universitarias a los estudiantes y cambiar la política de comercienta nacional que no representa solamente Estados Unidos en presalear, pero los estadounidenses comunes. Y con una mayoría en el Senado al lado de la presidenta Hillary Clinton vamos a mantener viva esa visión de Estados Unidos para nuestra generación. Señor Esa en Tocha, en la Bahía, en la ciudad donde yo vivo no se va a pagar, no se va a tener, va a seguir brillante en los corazones de todos los estadounidenses. Gracias que dos les bendiga y que Dios bendiga a los Estados Unidos.",

        "transcript": " Hello New York, I love you! Now, there is a statue in the harbor of the city I represent, a mighty woman with a torch. To me, that torch represents the American dream. And if you ask the average American what that dream means to them, they put it simply not in fancy language, they'd say, if I work hard, I'll be doing better, 10 years from now than I'm doing today, and my kids will be doing still better than me. Each generation must keep that torch burning brightly. It's the source of our optimism. President Obama did, he fought every day to defend fundamental American hope. But we have more work to do. Middle-class incomes have not grown enough. Too many families struggle to make ends meet, and if that continues, the torch will flicker. Its power to inspire hope will dim. Some are using this unease to pit Americans against each other. Not us, we Democrats fight for an America that works for everyone that's focused on leveling the playing field for all of us. And when Hillary Clinton wins the White House and Democrats win back to Senate majority, that is just what we will do. My friends, Hillary understands what middle-class families need better than anyone. I know, because I know Hillary. I work by her side for eight years. As senators together, we were representing the great state of New York. And now folks, I'm from Brooklyn. It's in our blood to sniff out bull. Now, there's a lot of that in politics, but not in Hillary when she tells you something, take it to the bank. I saw it, a remarkable ability to listen, internalize the concerns and fears and hopes and dreams of everyday Americans, and then work hard and get things done for them. Hillary listened to the factory worker at the Bechtel Plant in Schenectady, worried sick that his company was leaving town. Hillary got tough. She read the Corporate Han chose the Riot Act until they agreed to keep their plant open, saving his job and many others. And Hillary listened to the first responders and union workers who rushed to the pile after that terrible day 9-11. They were searching for signs of life in the smoldering rubble, breathing in toxic fumes with every breath. She championed their cause, fought to get them the healthcare they deserved, and they got it. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the kind of leadership this country needs, and the sticks could not be higher. Most elections are about two different visions for America. This election is about two different visions of America. And Donald Trump can only see an angry America fearful, small, close to the world and suspicious of our friends and our neighbors. Hillary sees a different America, an America that strives to live up to the promise written here in Philadelphia that every man, every woman, has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And America, where we don't build walls, we break down barriers, we shatter ceilings. And that's because our differences make us stronger, stronger together. So Hillary Clinton has the right vision of and for America. But my colleagues and my Senate colleagues will agree with me. We cannot do it, she cannot do it alone. She's going to need a majority in the United States Senate. A Senate majority that puts a new Supreme Court justice on the bench, who will protect women's rights, voting rights, and undo that awful decision citizens united. A Senate majority that will raise the minimum wage, ensure equal pay for women that will pass comprehensive immigration reform, make substantial investments in infrastructure, give every student a shot at affording a college education, and that changes our trade policy. So it doesn't represent corporate America, but represents the average American. Hillary Clinton is President, a strong Senate majority by her side. We will keep that American dream alive for a new generation. And ladies and gentlemen, that torch in the harbor of the city in which I live, it won't flicker, it won't fade, it will burn brightly in the heart of every American. Thank you, God bless you and God bless America.",

        "transcript": " Senator Schumer, I want to pick your brain on presidential politics for a bit. And because you're my guest right now, I want you to be the one that chooses. Should we start with the Democrats or do we start with the Republicans? Either way is okay. All right, let's start with the general comment. Let's both. Let's start with the Republicans. Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina as a ticket. What will that be like for the Democrats to run against in a general election if it were to happen? Well, look, I think the party candidate that will win is the one who convinces the middle class that he or she can do the most for them. Look, let's face it, in upstate New York and around America. It's hard to stay in the middle class. It's hard to get to the middle class. I don't believe that Mr. Cruz and Ms. Fiorina will convince middle class people they want to help them. Their basic platform, cutting taxes on the very wealthy people, cutting Medicare, cutting social security, doing things like that is not going to appeal to average middle class people. So I'm not so sure they'd be a very strong ticket. Let's talk about Donald Trump before we get to the Democrats. We saw him give a speech on foreign policy today. And I'd imagine that I could give you an hour and you could take it and in your own way tear into it and let me know what you think on that. I'm going to guess that you disagree with Mr. Trump on almost every foreign policy decision. He says he would make his president, but I'm wondering about something a little more personal. Given the fact that you are both New Yorkers, I consider you both big name New Yorkers, did you know Mr. Trump personally or professionally prior to his getting into the race for president? I knew Donald Trump personally, professionally before he got into the race, who's a big developer into New York and occasionally our paths would cross. I found him to be the same individual he is now. He says what he thinks. He's very confident in himself, but I think that as president you need more than that. You need more than just saying, leave it to me. I'll solve this problem. I'm strong. Great. You need to have specifics. Average middle class people have been promised so much by so many people that they want to see the specifics. What are you going to do to make college more affordable? What are you going to do to stop jobs from being shift overseas? I think Hillary Clinton, frankly, has a much more detailed platform, has much greater experience. At the end of this long campaign, people are going to end up saying she has got the ability to actually make my life a little better, and apply to the middle class a little better. You've pivoted to the Democrats, so we will as well. I'm wondering in your mind, is it time for Senator Bernie Sanders to leave the race for the Democratic nomination, particularly after Secretary Clinton's victories last night? Well, Senator Clinton had some very handsome victories last night. But I'm not going to tell Bernie Sanders what to do. I know him for a long time. He's a passionate man with strong beliefs on certain ideas like trade. He has moved the whole country in his direction, and I'm glad for that. I think this idea of shipping jobs overseas and allowing companies to just move overseas and give them tax breaks for it. It makes no sense whatsoever. But I would say this about Bernie. I think Hillary will be the nominee. But I think Bernie is ultimately a very constructive person. And he will pursue a path. I can't tell you what it is. I don't consult them day to day because I'm a Hillary supporter. But the path he'll choose will be constructed. He will not try to tear things down. There was a harder to elect a Democrat. There was a belief after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama ran against each other in that contest. That Hillary Clinton being in it made then Senator Barack Obama a better candidate in the general election. And I'm assuming some people believe that made him a better president. Can you point to ways that Bernie Sanders is right now making Hillary Clinton better? Well, I wouldn't comment on if he's making Hillary Clinton better. He's improved the overall campaign by his focus on the middle class, on helping average folks. A lot of things Bernie stands for, I believe, in a large infrastructure program. No cuts to Medicare and Social Security, making college much more affordable for kids. And those kinds of things have gone center stage now in the campaign. I think that's good, not just for Bernie Sanders, but for Hillary Clinton and for the Democrats. Because those are things that middle class people care about.",

        "transcript": " The Democratic Party currently in one of its weakest positions in Washington, D.C. and nationally in the last century is trying to figure out how to rebuild the first order of business electing Senator Chuck Schumer as the new Senate minority leader. The Brooklyn-Borin-Three-Term Senator from New York is already foreshadowing a New York-style showdown, telling his fellow New Yorker President-elect Trump to expect a, quote, strong and tough fight. Let's bring in CNN, senior Washington correspondent Jeff Dallani, Jeff. Senator Schumer and President-elect Trump, they go back. Trump, in fact, used to be a campaign contributor to Mr. Schumer. Jake, he did. That's when Donald Trump was a Democrat, not so long ago. But oddly, Senator Schumer and Donald Trump have one of the longest relationships of any of the leaders here in Washington, certainly more than the Republican leaders do. Senator Schumer says he is going to fight with Donald Trump, but not reflexively. He will not oppose things. He says simply because they're Donald Trump's ideas. He's the last Democrat standing in the way of Donald Trump. Fellow New Yorker, Senator Chuck Schumer. We're ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with Republicans, working with soon-to-be President Trump on issues where we agree. But we will go toe to toe against the President-elect whenever our values or the progress we've made is under assault. It's a delicate dance for Schumer. Elected today by Senate Democrats to lead them beyond their singing defeat into the new era of Trump, he faces a balancing act of confrontation and cooperation. He said he'll do both. Indeed, silver lining in the deep clouds of this election is that on many economic issues, President-elect Trump and his campaign was closer to us than to Republican leadership, which always seems to wind up in the corner of the special interests. Of all the new dynamics that lie ahead in Trump's Washington, the relationship between the incoming President and the new Democratic leader could be the one to watch. The two have a far deeper history than most anyone in the Capitol. That much was clear last month at the Al Smith Charity Dinner in New York. He used to love me when I was a Democrat, you know. Trump, who gave money to many Democrats over the years, also contributed to a handful of Schumer's campaigns. Thank you, sir. The Schumer household is an stranger to working across the aisle. Iris? His wife, Iris Weinschull, was transportation commissioner under Republican New York mayor Rudy Giuliani. And even though their differences are wide, spanning a divide from Schumer's Brooklyn to Trump's Fifth Avenue, they've often bonded over their love of New York and their quest to make a deal. When Trump and Ted Cruz were sparring over New York values in the GOP primary, Schumer sided with Trump. He stood up for New York 100%. As Democrats pick up the pieces from Hillary Clinton's stunning defeat, the party is in the wilderness and on Capitol Hill in the minority. When you lose an election like this, you can't flinch. You can't ignore it. You need to look at right in the eye and ask why. Analyze it and learn from it. To rebuild the party, Schumer added independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to the ranks of Senate Democratic leadership, but at Schumer, who will be cutting deals or sparring with Trump. We're not going to just as some have done here in the past, said just because it's President Trump's idea or thought, we're going to oppose it per se. Where we can work together, we will. But I've also said to the President-elect on issues where we disagree, you can expect a strong and tough fight. One person not a bad fight, Jake, is Hillary Clinton. But she will be making her first appearance since conceding one week ago tonight during a speech at the Children's Defense Fund in Washington. I'm told by an aide that she will urge her supporters to remain committed to progressive politics at every level. Jake.",

        "transcript": " Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Let me first start by saying this is a lot better than the last time I did one of these in Miami. Let me begin by telling you a few moments ago, I got off the phone with Congressman Murphy, and I congratulated him on a good race. Congressman Murphy is a young man with a bright future, and I thanked him for his willingness to step forward in public service. Guys, running for office is hard, putting your name on the ballot is hard, and I congratulate him and his family, and I look forward to seeing the ways he is going to serve our country in the future. I want to begin by acknowledging what I always do, and that is absolutely, you should Patrick did a great race. All the glory and the praise belongs to my creator, to God, from my personal faith, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He has carried us in every moment of our life, in the good times, in the difficult ones, in the twists and turns, and there has been a number of twists and turns this year. And so I always acknowledge God, and I thank God because the greatest blessing He has given me after the opportunity to be a citizen of the greatest nation on earth is an extraordinary woman to share my life with my wife, Janette, and my four children on third grade. We had a great campaign team, and I wish I could mention all of their names, there are so many great people, but I do want to acknowledge someone who came here and helped us run this campaign, and did a phenomenal job. There is no one better in the country right now, in my opinion, at running these things than the person who ran mine, his name is Clint Reed, and I want to thank him through his work. I want to thank the staff in my Senate office. I can't tell you how many people came up to me and said, you know, I'm not a Republican, but I'm going to vote for you because you guys helped me. You helped me with the Social Security claim. You helped me with an issue at the VA, and that's the work we do. We are honored to do it, and that is the people that work in my offices in Washington and all across Florida. We have the best Senate staff in America, and I'm grateful to them. And of course, I want to thank the people of this extraordinary state for giving me another opportunity to continue to serve them in the United States Senate. This is an extraordinary place, Florida. It is the collection of all the things that make us the greatest nation on earth, of people who have lived here for decades, of the descendants of slaves, of the children of immigrants, Florida is America. And it's such an honor to be able to represent this extraordinary state. I want to say a few words in Spanish because I know people get their news in Spanish, a lot of people that vote for me, learned about me in Spanish, and want to start to recognize me. They are here, but I want to start to recognize our population of Puerto Rican, the Boricos that helped us. And our friends in the island of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is here today. Also the people of Venezuela are with you, and I thank them for living here in this community. I'm also here with my family, with Colombia, so I want to thank them. We have been through an interesting year as a nation, and we are a result of tonight's election. But here's what I know for sure. Here's what I know. There is still no nation on earth that I would rather be. Despite all of our challenges, there is no country, and there is no people on this planet that I would trade places with. I am glad that I'm an American in the 21st century. America is going to be okay. We will turn this country around. I have faith. I know God is not done with America yet. He has great plans for our people. And the days and weeks to come, I hope that we as a people here in Florida, I hope we will set the example in this great state, that while we can disagree on issues, we cannot share a country where people hate each other because of their political affiliations. We cannot move forward as a nation if we cannot have enlightened debates about tough issues. You can disagree with someone without hating them, and you can disagree with them without delegitimizing their point of view. That doesn't mean that our diversity will not continue to divide us on critical issues. It does mean that there is no way for this nation to move forward if we leave anyone behind. And so I hope that I and my colleagues, as we return to work in Washington DC, can set a better example of how political discourse should exist in this country. And I know people feel betrayed, and you have a right to. Every major institution in our society has failed us. The media, the government, big business, Wall Street, academia, they have all failed us. And so people are so frustrated and angry. But we must channel that anger and frustration into something positive. Let us move us forward as energy to confront and solve our challenges and our problems. America has never had an easy era. Florida has never had an easy era. Our state has always confronted great challenges, and so too has our people. And yet in each generation, Americans have stepped forward to confront their challenges and embrace their opportunities. And now the time has come for us to do the same. I believe with all my heart that if we do what needs to be done in the years to come, that my children and yours will be the freest and the most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. But we must start now. For while we still have time to get this right, we do not have forever. I will close by saying that while I have the belief, but the decisions we make in government are important. I know that in the end, America will not be saved by politicians. I hope that we as a nation will return to our roots as a people and as a nation, respecting our diversity but understanding that ultimately what unites us as a people is the common dream and the common hope of a better life. And that we can only achieve that if we all achieve that. And I hope that God gives me the opportunity and the voice to move forward. And I'll close with this. I hope this nation tonight, irrespective of the outcome for president, that we will all say a prayer for our great country. Because as the ancient words of scripture tell us, unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain who build. And unless the Lord guard the city in vain, does the guard keep watch? Let us work together. God bless this great nation. Thank you for the opportunity to continue to serve. God bless all of you and God bless Florida. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.",

All the glory and praise belongs to my creator, to God, from my personal faith, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He has carried us in every moment of our life in the good times and the difficult ones and the twists and turns and there has been a number of twists and turns this year. I always acknowledge God and I thank God because the greatest blessing he has given me after the opportunity to be a citizen of the greatest nation on earth is an extraordinary woman to share my life with my wife Jeanette and my four children. We had a great campaign team and I wish I could mention all of their names, there are so many great people but I do want to acknowledge someone who came here and helped us run this campaign and did a phenomenal job. There is no one better in the country right now in my opinion at running these things than the person who ran mine. His name is Clint Reed and I want to thank him for his work and this fantastic work. I want to thank the staff in my Senate office. I can't tell you how many people came up to me and said, you know, I'm not a Republican but I'm going to vote for you because you guys helped me. You helped me with the Social Security claim. You helped me with an issue at the VA and that's the work we do. We are honored to do it and that is the people that work in my offices in Washington and all across Florida. We have the best Senate staff in America and I'm grateful to them. And of course I want to thank the people of this extraordinary state for giving me another opportunity to continue to serve them in the United States Senate. This is an extraordinary place, Florida. It is the collection of all the things that make us the greatest nation on earth, of people who have lived here for decades, of the descendants of slaves, of the children of immigrants, Florida is America. And it's such an honor to be able to represent this extraordinary state. I want to say a few words in Spanish because I know people get their news in Spanish, a lot of people that vote for me, learned about me in Spanish, and want to start to recognize us. If you are not here, I want to start to recognize our population of Puerto Rican, the Puerto Rico that we helped. And our friends are in the island of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is here today. Also the people of Venezuela are with you and I thank you to the Venezuelans who live in the United States. To the Colombians who also have my wife and her family. Where do they come from? I am here. Yo y amente. La Juano, la Florida, la Juano. Thank you very much. We have been through an interesting year as a nation and we arrayed the results of tonight's election. But here's what I know for sure. Here's what I'm, here's what I am, here's what I know. There is still no nation on earth that I would rather be. Despite all of our challenges, there is no country and there is no people on this planet that I would trade places with. I am glad that I'm an American in the 21st century. America is going to be okay. We will turn this country around. I have faith. I know God is not done with America yet. He has great plans for our people. In the days and weeks to come, I hope that we as a people here in Florida, we will set the example in this great state that while we can disagree on issues, we cannot share a country where people hate each other because of their political affiliations. We cannot move forward as a nation if we cannot have enlightened debates about tough issues. You can disagree with someone without hating them and you can disagree with them without delegitimizing their point of view. That doesn't mean that our diversity will not continue to divide us on critical issues. It does mean that there is no way for this nation to move forward if we leave anyone behind. And so I hope that I and my colleagues, as we return to work in Washington, D.C., can set a better example of how political discourse should exist in this country.",

        "transcript": " the city of Florida. And good evening. Come with you live from the Fox for studios right now. It's today a lot of people have been looking forward to or maybe just looking forward to get over with for a long time in Florida and beyond. Alive look at what's happening right now in Miami Dave County. Senator Mark Carubio all smiles as his family comes on to the stage. He has just been elected to a second six year term in the US Senate. Yes, and as we are beginning our coverage here, we want to give you a look at some of the numbers there. It looks like actually he's taking the stage live now. Or Lisa Greenberg is there. Let's take a listen to what Mark Carubio has to say about his second term as a US senator. Let me first start by saying this is a lot better than the last time I did one of these in Miami. Let me let me begin by tell you a few moments ago, I got off the phone with Congressman Murphy and I congratulated him on a good race. Congressman Murphy is a young man with a bright future and I thanked him for his willingness to step forward in public service. Guys running for office is hard. Putting your name on the ballot is hard. And I congratulate him and his family and I look forward to seeing the ways he is going to serve our country in the future. I want to begin by acknowledging what I always do and that is absolutely. You should pat Patrick did ran a great race. All the glory and the praise belongs to my creator to God from my personal faith, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He has carried us in every moment of our life and the good times and the difficult ones and the twists and turns and there has been a number of twists and turns this year and so I always acknowledge God and I thank God because the greatest blessing he has given me after the opportunity to be a citizen of the greatest nation on earth is an extraordinary woman to share my life with my wife Jeanette and my four children.

There is no one better in the country right now in my opinion at running these things than the person who ran mine his name is Jeanette and I am proud of the great people who have been here and have been here and I am proud of the great people who have been here and I want to thank the staff in my Senate office. I can't tell you how many people came up to me and said you know I am not a Republican but I am going to vote for you because you guys helped me. You helped me with the social security claim. You helped me with an issue at the VA and that is the work we do. We are honored to do it and that is the people that work in my offices in Washington and all across Florida. We have the best Senate staff in the United States. And of course I want to thank the people of this extraordinary state for giving me another opportunity to continue to serve them in the United States Senate. This is an extraordinary place, Florida. It is the collection of all the things that make us the greatest nation on earth. Of people who have lived here for decades, of the descendants of slaves, of the children of immigrants, Florida is America.

And our friend is in the island of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is here today. We are here with you and I thank you to the Venezuelans living in the United States. To the Colombians who also are my wife and family. To the Colombians. So obviously, the Cuban, Florida, the Cuban. Thank you very much. We have been through an interesting year as a nation. And we array the results of tonight's election. But here's what I know for sure. Here's what I am. Here's what I am. Here's what I know. There is still no nation on earth that I would rather be. Despite all of our challenges, there is no country and there is no people on this planet that I would trade places with. I am glad that I'm an American in the 21st century. America is going to be okay. I will turn this country around. I have faith. I know God is not done with America yet. He has great plans for our people. And the days and weeks to come. I hope that we as a people here in Florida, I hope we will set the example in this great state. That while we can disagree on issues, we cannot share a country where people hate each other because of their political affiliations. And not move forward as a nation if we cannot have enlightened debates about tough issues. You can disagree with someone without hating them. And you can disagree with them without delegitimizing their point of view. That doesn't mean that our diversity will not continue to divide us on critical issues. It does mean that there is no way for this nation to move forward if we leave anyone behind. And so I hope that I and my colleagues, as we return to work in Washington, D.C., can set a better example of how people are going to be able to be able to do something more practical, of how political discourse should exist in this country. And I know people feel betrayed and you have a right to. Every major institution in our society has failed us. The media, the government, big business, Wall Street, academia, they have all failed us. And so people are so frustrated and angry. But we must channel that anger and frustration into something positive. Let us move us forward as energy to confront and solve our challenges and our problems. America has never had an easy era. Florida has never had an easy era. Our state has always confronted great challenges. And so too has our people. And yet in each generation, Americans are step forward to confront their challenges and embrace their opportunities. And now the time has come for us to do the same. I believe with all my heart that if we do what needs to be done in the years to come, that my children and yours will be the freest and the most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. But we must start now. For while we still have time to get this right, we do not have forever. I will close by saying that while I have the belief that the decisions we make in government are important, I know that in the end, America will not be saved by politicians. I hope that we as a nation will return to our roots as a people and as a nation, respecting our diversity but understanding that ultimately what unites us as a people is the common dream and the common hope of a better life. And that we can only achieve that if we all achieve that. And I hope that God gives me the opportunity and the voice to move forward. And I'll close with this. I hope this nation tonight, irrespective of the outcome for president, that we will all say a prayer for our great country. Because as the ancient words of Scripture tell us, unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain who build. And unless the Lord guard the city in vain, does the guard keep watch. Let us work together. God bless this great nation. Thank you for the opportunity to continue to serve. God bless all of you. And God bless Florida. Thank you. Thank you very much.",

        "transcript": " Thank you very much. Thank you. All right, thank you. It's an honor to be with you today. Let me just begin by being perfectly frank. In a few minutes after I speak, I'll have to leave early and I want you to understand why I think you'll understand. Have you guys ever had a cold and you buy that little box and it has the dayside and the nightside on the box? I took the wrong side like two hours ago. So we got a hurry here before you get to read about my views on trucking in America today. So first of all, thank you. I'm really, it's an honor to be with you today. Actually, a week ago this very night was a long ceremony. My daughter graduated from high school. I thought it was very long, so I'm going to try to keep my speech short because her graduation ceremony ended about 15 minutes ago. But it's funny, I was there and so you're reading someone so graduate. GPA 18.2, I didn't even know it was possible. And so people, you know, my kids asked me, what was your GPA? What was your GPA when you graduated? I'm like, oh, we had different numbers back then. So I was going through this. This is a really impressive student college acceptances. Let me just begin. Look, I'm not when it comes to like college, particularly college football in particular, which is the reason why we even have a country. I am deeply biased and I'm going to leave Florida state out of it for a moment just because they... they, they, they, whatever. I think they, they kind of like vote, so never mind. But anyway, but no, but look, I know a few of you, I see the University of Florida, who's going to Florida? You're set for life. Now there's a number other schools, good schools, SEC schools, Auburn, Auburn, Louisiana State, University of Mississippi, University of South Carolina, University of Tennessee. Right? Is that these... Alright. I just want to be the first to offer you my deepest condolences. And I, this young lady just saying unbelievable grace. Is that your family? Grace? Why would parents let their kids go to Alabama? Nick, Nick Savon's evil empire. I'm of course kidding, kind of, about these things. And, but, but you're all, you should be very proud. I know how you feel tonight and, you know, the song, it's time to say goodbye. I've been told not really, they still make like cameo appearances at inopportune times, usually about the 20th of the month, you get that call is what I hear about kids when they go to college 21st of the month. Yeah, like this month, I spent, I had this expense I didn't know was coming, so, so they don't necessarily say goodbye. It's more like one of those programs where the characters keep showing up. But it's fine, you know, the one thing I have heard, again my daughter is my oldest is only 18, but this I've heard from everyone I believe it's an established fact, and that is that grandkids are better than kids. But you can't have them without the kids first, so. So, I really wanted to be with you. Like I said, my speech is not very long because Casey stole my speech, and so you just spoke more than a ghost. So, I'm going to give you a different one that I have here, and it's about the stock market. No, I'm kidding. So, no thank you for, I'm honored to be with you. So, one of the things that's been most interesting, I don't know if you've seen on television, CNN has this series on 1968. Are any of you alive in 1968? A few of you? Okay. So, back in ancient times, 1968. No, but they have this documentary series. The Washington Post also did this front page article about 1968, and the reason why it's getting all this coverage is it's best known as a year of tremendous upheaval in America. It was, to have two major political figures assassinated in that year, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. There were race riots that broke out across America, crime spiraled out of control in all across the country, and of course Vietnam, very painful, painful episode of American history, and it caused very deep divisions that actually forced a sitting president, Lyndon Johnson, to not even seek re-election. It's also the year that gave rise to something that was called the counter-culture. Years later they'd be known as hippies, but it was basically young Americans who decided to reject our cultural norms. And young men grew their hair long, people were using drugs as if they were liberating, the phrase make love, not war, was on all these signs that people were holding. And as I read the story in the newspaper and I watched parts of the CNN documentary, I thought to myself, and hear me out, I don't want you to think that the cold medicines kicked in yet. I thought to myself, you know what this country really needs right now, it actually needs another counter-cultural movement, and let me explain what I mean by that. First of all, let me just say, I'm here today to call on these young men and women to rebel, and it sounds from what I've heard in a few minutes I've been up here that they were well on their way to some sort of rebellion to begin with as far as this senior class was concerned. They are apparently re- at the school is re-evaluating the, whether they're going to keep the high school program open, which is for us, no, I'm kidding. But as I told you, we could go this very night, my own daughter graduated from high school down in Miami, and so I know what parents, grandparents and others that are here thinking right now in this award. What kind of graduation speech is this? Asking people to rebel. But I'll repeat what I said, and I mean this in as strong as possible terms. My strongest advice to you is to rebel against the prevalent trends in our culture today. You have grown up in the world that my generation helped to make, and this month, all across this country, at convention halls and auditoriums and college arenas, there are these very prominent successful quote unquote speakers, will be sharing with graduates free advice on the rest of your life. Let me tell you the advice on paraphrasing it, but I've seen enough of these now on YouTube and things like that to tell you more or less what the general trend is. The first is that people are generally good, and therefore so are you, that no matter what you have done or what you will do, you should always feel good about yourself, have supreme confidence in yourself. The other thing they'll tell you is that rely on yourself, you're the master of your own fate. I've actually heard it said that prayer is only for the most extreme problems, and if at all, and that we all know, by the way, I've heard a number of occasions, not a graduation speeches, but every now and then people love to cite to me the very famous Bible verse that I'm sure you know well, God helps those who help themselves, right? What is the citation on that? You guys, I spent all night looking for it, but you'll be told, they're told that you're the ultimate judge of what is right or wrong for you. What might be wrong to others is, that's their opinion, as long as you aren't hurting anyone, if something makes you happy, it's probably the right thing to do. The truly good and successful people, the other message, are the ones that people like. If you're famous, if you won an election, if you made a lot of money, you're successful. So tonight, make sure that the pictures you decide to put on Instagram are the ones that will get the most likes and the best comments. And then check on them throughout the evening to make sure that you're getting good likes and comments on it. And also, by the way, the best way to make sure people know that you care about them is to like and comment on their pictures. The people are young people, so go change the world, which often means go out and fight for the things that the most and highest number people possible are for. Because basically the more people agree with you and what you're saying are doing, then the better your cause obviously is. If on the other hand, someone stands for something that most people aren't for, that must be inherently wrong, and maybe even evil. In fact, people with these views should be silenced or at a minimum, they should keep their opinions themselves. You'll learn through both these speeches and ultimately through living life these days, that the best way to deal with people who stand for something, most people disagree with is to embarrass them, to call them names, dunk on them online or burn them on social media. And by the way, go ahead and use profanity and vulgar language, they deserve it. And if what they stand for is also opposed by celebrities, the media, and the people with a lot of followers, then no one's going to criticize you for using profanities. For profanities, they'll probably celebrate you as brilliant and insightful. And by the way, you may pick up a bunch of new followers on social media, which only proves how right you are in the first place. And no matter what, never ever admit to weakness. In fact, you should do unto others as they did to you, maybe even worse, if they hit you, hit them back ten times harder. But if you are today's rules of life, these are the keys and the minds of many people to success, at least according to the culture and the society, which you are about to inherit. But I wonder, what if your generation decided to rebel against these rules? And it sounds from the speeches I've heard here tonight that you're a well on your way? But indeed, instead, you recognized that you are flawed people. All of us are. That we are prone to make mistakes and bad decisions, are actually our nature. And that you can't trust your feelings or sometimes even your own intelligence to always make the right decisions. And so you recognize that we need not just laws, by the way, but values that help guide us on what is right and what is wrong. What if you accepted that there are things that are always right and that there are truly things that are always wrong? What if you were the generation that once again started seeing weakness as strength and human strength as weakness? What if changing the world is about what you can do for others instead of what you can gain for yourself? And... What if you were the generation that decided that rejection and persecution for doing what is right is a blessing, a blessing to be embraced instead of a curse to be avoided? And what about if you were the generation that instead of attacking those who attack you or us, you return their anger with kindness. And you return hatred with love. Well, this would be counter-cultural. This would be a counter-cultural rebellion which would shock a lot of people. The thing is, this counter-cultural rebellion isn't new. It was actually modeled and taught by someone over 2,000 years ago in a culture, frankly, whose values. We're not all that unlike many of the values that have found mainstream acceptance today. For those of us who are of the Christian faith and I have a suspicion, there's a lot of those in the room today, Jesus of Nazareth was a God, made man. But whether you believe that or not, I believe it is an indisputable truth that Jesus of Nazareth was the most influential person who ever lived. He had no money, he had no political power, had no army, didn't even have an Instagram account. He was executed naked by the government. And while being executed with people walked by and they laughed at him and they mocked him and they spit on him and they called him names, he had a lot of people following him until things got bad. And then even the people closest to him went into hiding when he was arrested. He was the one who had actually entrusted with key leadership, denied even knowing him not once, not twice, but three times. And yet he led a counter-cultural revolution that ended up overthrowing the most powerful empire in the world just a few decades later. And life on earth for both those who believe in him as God and those who don't has frankly never been the same. Even now, even today, separated by two centuries, his impact has felt all over this planet. On this very day there are thousands of hungry children on this planet who are being fed in his name. On this very day there are thousands of homeless people who are being housed and cared for in his name. On this very day there are thousands of sick people who are being treated. In his name and on this very day there are thousands of people dying who are not dying alone in his name. Over 2,000 years after the death of this counter-cultural revolution, one led by a poor, powerless, 33-year-old, he is still making a bigger impact than any celebrity, any political leader, any government, or any organization on earth now, or at any time in its history. And my advice to you is to rebel against our modern culture and embrace instead the one that has changed the world. What I will not claim to use is that this will be easy. The values that he both taught and modeled are as unpopular today as they were in his time. Frankly, it is something I struggle with and will admit to not always getting right. After all, I am in a line of work where I need at least more than half the people to like me. And I am in this line of work at a time when so many people, sadly even many who confess to being followers of Jesus, reject many of the things he taught. I cannot promise you that embracing these values will make you famous or rich or popular. In fact, I can almost assure you they will cause some to mock and ridicule you and maybe even some persecute you. But what I can tell you without any reservation is that the more someone lives like Jesus, the more they exhibit true love. A love that isn't a noun but a love that is a verb. A love that isn't what you feel but rather expressed in how you live and in what you do. The more someone lives like Jesus, the more joy and peace they seem to have. Not a joy and a peace that depends on what happens but rather a joy and a peace that comes no matter what happens. The more someone lives like Jesus, the more patience they seem to have. Patience as you wait for blessings and patience as you endure with your trials. The more someone lives like Jesus, the more kindness and goodness people seem to exhibit. Kindness towards those who do not return it and a goodness that is lived. Not just spoken. The more someone lives like Jesus, the more faithily seem to be a faith that actually gets stronger in the face of adversity. A faith that allows them to persevere when others doubt. The more someone lives like Jesus, the gentler they are, gentle in the face of aggression. Able to unite where others divide and mend what others break. And the more someone lives like Jesus, the more self-control they seem to have. Truly free from the chains of modern life that bind so many. The alternative is to live life the way things are now, to conform to the culture of today. And while it may be easy to talk about it here, the world is about to test you. Because it is a culture that celebrates anything that feels good and will make you a slave of the pursuit of it. It is a culture in which we sacrifice our health, our families and our values in the worship of money and approval and fame. A culture where we seek magic solutions to our problems from the latest life culture, self-help book or even a psychic. A culture where we spend our time and search of something to be outraged by and someone to fight with over it. It is a culture where we increasingly separate ourselves from our neighbors, from our lifelong friends and even from family, because of who they voted for, or what they believe in. A culture where we can't help but cheer on or heckle back at public fits of anger and insult, whether they are broadcast live on cable news or captured on a cell phone video. This is the broader culture that you have been raised in, not in your homes and not in this school, but the broader culture. This is the broader culture that sadly you inherit, but it does not have to be the culture you live in, and it does not have to be the culture you leave behind. So I ask you once again, Rebell, refuse to conform to this. It will most definitely change the course of your life. And if by some chance it catches on and others copy you, then who knows? It may even end up changing and saving our country and saving and changing the world. So thank you and God bless you. Good luck. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Thank you very much. Well, I want to thank you all very much. This is great. These are our friends. We have thousands of friends on this incredible movement. This was a movement like nobody's ever seen before. And, frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There's never been anything like this in this country and maybe beyond. And now it's going to reach a new level of importance because we're going to help our country heal. We're going to help our country heal. We have a country that needs help and it needs help very badly. We're going to fix our borders. We're going to fix everything about our country. We made history for a reason tonight and the reason is going to be just that. We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible. And it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing. Look what happened. Is this crazy? But it's a political victory that our country has never seen before. Nothing like this. I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected. You're 47th President and you're 45th President. And every citizen I will fight for you, for your family and your future. Every single day I will be fighting for you and with every breath in my body. I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve. This will truly be the golden age of America. That's what we have to know. This is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again. And in addition to having won the battleground states of North Carolina, I love these places. Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. We are now winning in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, and Alaska, which would result in us carrying at least 315 electoral votes. But it's much easier doing what the networks did or whoever called it because there was no other path. There was no other path to victory. We also have won the popular vote. That was great. Thank you very much. We have won the popular vote. It was very nice. It was a great feeling of love. We have a great feeling of love in this very large room with unbelievable people standing by my side. These people have been incredible. They've made the journey with me and we're going to make you very happy. I hope that you're going to be looking back someday and say that was one of the truly important moments of my life when I voted for this group of people beyond the President. This group of great people. America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate. We have taken back control of the Senate. Under Senate races in Montana, Nevada, Texas, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We're all won by the Magga movement. They helped so much. In those cases, every one of them we worked with the senators. They were tough races. I mean, the number of victories in the Senate was absolutely incredible. We did teller rallies. We did teller rallies with each one of them. Sometimes we did two or three for, and it was amazing to look at all of those victories. Nobody expected that. Nobody. So I just wanted to thank you very much for that. You have some great senators and some great new senators. And it also looks like we'll be keeping control of the House of Representatives. And I want to thank Mike Johnson. I think he's doing a terrific job. Terrific job. I want to also thank my beautiful wife, Melania, for Slady. Who has the number one best-selling book in the country? Can you please? Thank you. Now she's done a great job. Works very hard. Works very hard to help people. So I just want to thank her. But I want to thank my whole family, my amazing children, and they are amazing children. Now we all think our children. Everybody thinks their children are amazing. That's a good thing when you think they are. But Don, Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany, Baron, Laura, Jared, Kimberly, Michael. Thank you all. What a hell. My father-in-law Victor's tremendous. And we miss very much Melania's mother, Amalia. Yeah, we miss Amalia, don't we? Yeah? She would be very happy right now. Standing on this stage, she'd be so proud. She was a great woman, that one. Beautiful. Inside and out. She was a great woman. I want to be the first to congratulate our great. Now I can say Vice President-elect of the United States, Toby Brown. And is absolutely remarkable and beautiful wife, Usha Bez. And he is a feisty guy, isn't he? You know, I've said, go into the enemy camp. And you know, the enemy camp is certain networks. A lot of people don't like this. Sir, do I have to do that? He just goes, okay. Which one? CNN, MSDNC. He'll say, all right, thank you very much. He actually looks like. He's still like the only guy I've ever seen. He really looks forward to it. And then he just goes in absolutely obliterate step. Say a couple of words. Well, Mr. President, I appreciate you allowing me to join you on this incredible journey. Thank you for the trust that you've placed in me. And I think that we just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America. And under President Trump's leadership, we're never going to stop fighting for you, for your dreams, for the future of your children. And after the greatest political comeback in American history, we're going to leave the greatest economic comeback in American history under Donald Trump's leadership. Thank you very much. He's turned out to be a good choice. I took a little heat at the beginning, but I knew the brain was a good one about as good as it gets. And we love the family, and we're going to have a great four years, and we're going to turn our country around, make it something very special. We lost that little thing called special. We have to make it so. We're going to make this so great. It's the greatest country, and potentially the greatest country in the world by far. And right now, we're going to just work very hard to get all of that back. We're going to make it the best it's ever been. We can do that. We just, if we had to wait longer, I don't know it was going bad, and it was going bad fast. We're going to have to seal up those borders, and we're going to have to let people come into our country. We want people to come back in, but we have to let them come back in, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in legally. Let me also express my tremendous appreciation for Susie and Chris, the job you did. Susie, come here Susie. Chris, come here, Chris. Susie likes to stay sort of in the back. Let me tell you, the ice cream we call it the ice cream. Susie likes to stay in the back, but she's not in the back. This was unexpected, but I just want to thank, obviously President Trump for this journey. It was a great one, and he's a hell of a candidate. He's going to be a hell of a great 47th President, and this team that we had, the best team, and of course, even my boss Susie Wiles, the best. Thank you. Thank you, and thank you, Susie. I've never seen her be shot before. Susie, they're great. Everybody up here is great. Everybody up here is very special, but the Trump, who do you say? Oh, let me tell you, we have a new star. A star is born Elon. Now he is. Now he's an amazing guy. We were sitting together tonight. He spent two weeks in Philadelphia and different parts of Pennsylvania. Camp painting. He sent the rocket up two weeks ago, and I saw that rocket. I saw it coming down. I saw it. When it left it was beautiful, shiny white. When it came down, it did look so pretty. It was going 10,000 miles an hour, and it was burning like hell. I said, what happened to your paint job? He said, we've never made a paint that could withstand that kind of heat. But I saw it come down and turn around. And it was, you know, it's like 22 stories, though, by the way. It looks a little smaller than that, but it's big. And it came down and downed, and you saw that fire burning. And I'm saying, only Elon could do this. It must be an Elon. And I told the story. I told it last night. I had a man on the phone. I had the screen muted. No sound. I was talking to a very important man. And that happens to be here. And that very important guy, one of the most important people. And I would say the country, actually. But, you know, I was president. And now it looks like I was going to be maybe president again. So I figured I could ask him to hold. So I asked him to hold. And because especially because you're going to be president again, they hold. So I took the phone down and I'm looking at the screen. I'm seeing this crazy thing that's going around and coming down. It looks like it's a crash into the gantry. And I said, Oh, no. And I said, do me a favor. You might hold him for a couple of minutes. I want to see this. I thought it was a space age movie or something. I put the phone down. But I didn't pick it up for 45 minutes. And he was holding. But this spaceship came down. And I saw those engines firing. And it looked like it was over. It was going to smash. And then I saw the fire pour out from the left side. And I put it straight. And it came down so gently. And then it wrapped those arms around it. And it held it. And just like you hold your baby at night, your little baby. And it was a beautiful thing to see. And I called Elon. I said, Elon, was that you? He said, yes, it was. I said, who else can do that? Can Russia do it? No. Can China do it? No. Can the United States do it? Other than you know, nobody can do that. I said, that's why I love you, Elon. That's great. And you know, when we had the tragic hurricane, Helene. And it hit, in particular, hit North Carolina. They were really devastated the water. This was a big water. As big as we've ever seen, water-hericated, built lakes out of nothing fields, became lakes. And the danger was unbelievable. And the people from North Carolina came to me and they said, would it be possible at all possible for you to speak to Elon Musk? We need Starlink. I said, what Starlink? It's a form of communications. I called Elon. And I'll tell you what, he had, and it was very dangerous. People would die. They had no communication. All the wires were down. I called Elon Musk. I said, Elon, you have something called Starlink. Is that right? Yes, I do. What the hell is it? He said, it's a communication system that's very good. I said, Elon, they need it really, really badly in North Carolina. Can you get a hear that there so fast? It was incredible. And it was great. It saved a lot of lives. He saved a lot of lives. But he's a character. He's a special guy. He's a super genius. We have to protect our geniuses. We don't have that many of them. We have to protect our super geniuses. I want to thank some of the people. You know, we have up here today. The U.S. Open Champion, he's fantastic. He's slightly longer than me. It's a little bit longer than me. Yes, a little bit. Bryson D. Shembo is up here, someplace. What happened to Bryson? Where is he? Bryson. Oh, he was young. He's sitting balls. He's on the way. He's sitting balls. Bryson. Oh, look at him. He had a great, he's got a great career going. Great U.S. Open Bryson. That's a fantastic job. And we also have a man Dana White who has done some job. He's a tough guy. Dana, so did UFC. And it came to me. You mind if I use your, nobody wanted to give me my rings because they said it's a rough sport, a little rough. And I helped him out a little bit. And I went and I said, this is the roughest sport I've ever seen. But I began to like it and he loved it. And nobody's done a better job in sports. And you know, he's a very motivational kind of a guy what he does. He gets these fighters and they really go at it and become one of the most successful sports enterprises anywhere at any time, doing so well. I'd like to ask Dana just to say a couple of words because people love to hear from him. Nobody deserves this more than him and nobody deserves this more than his family does. This is what happens when the machine comes after you. What you've seen over the last several years. This is what it looks like. Couldn't stop him. He keeps going forward. He doesn't quit. He's the most resilient, hard work and man I've ever met in my life. His family are incredible people. This is karma ladies and gentlemen. He deserves this. They deserve it as a family. I want to thank some people real quick. I want to thank the Nell boys, Aiden Ross, Theo Vaughan, Boston with the boys and last but not least, the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan. And thank you America. Thank you. Have a good night. That is a piece of work. Now he's an amazing, he's really an amazing guy. But most of all I want to thank the millions of hard work in Americans across the nation who have always been the heart and soul of this really great movement. We've been through so much together and today you showed up in record numbers to deliver a victory like really I probably like no other. This was something special and we're going to, we're going to pay you back. We're going to do the best job. We're going to, we're going to turn it around. It's got to be turned around. It's got to be turned around fast. And we're going to turn it around. We're going to do it in every way with so many ways, but we're going to do it in every way. This will forever be remembered as the day the American people regained control of their country. So I just want to say that on behalf of this great group of people, these are hard working people. These are fantastic people and we can add a few names like Robert of Kennedy Jr. And he's going to help make America healthy again. And now he's a great guy and he really means that he wants to do some things and we're going to let him go to it. I just said but Bobby, leave the oil to me. We have more liquid gold oil and gas. We have more liquid gold than any country in the world, more than Saudi Arabia. We have more than Russia. Bobby, stay away from the liquid gold. Other than that, go have a good time, Bobby. We're going to be paying down debt. We're going to be reducing taxes. We have weak and do things that nobody else can do. Nobody else is going to be able to do it. China doesn't have what we have. Nobody has what we have. But we have the greatest people also. Maybe that's the most important thing. This campaign has been so historic in so many ways. We've built the biggest, the broadest, the most unified coalition. They've never seen anything like it in all of American history. They've never seen it. A young and old men and women, rural and urban. And we had them all helping us tonight when you think. I mean, I was looking at it. I was watching it. They had some great analysis of the people that voted for us. Nobody's ever seen anything like that. It came from they came from all quarters union, non-union African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Arab American. Muslim American. We had everybody and it was beautiful. It was a historic realignment, uniting citizens of all backgrounds around a common core of common sense. You know, we're the party of common sense. We want to have borders. We want to have security. We want to have things be good, safe. We want great education. We want a strong and powerful military and ideally we don't have to use it. You know, we had no wars. Four years we had no wars, except we defeated ISIS. We defeated ISIS in record time. But we had no wars. They said he will start a war. I'm not going to start a war. I'm going to stop wars. But this is also a massive victory for democracy and for freedom. Together we're going to unlock America's glorious destiny and we're going to achieve the most incredible future for our people. Yesterday as I stood at my last stop on the campaign trail, I'll never be doing a rally again. Can you believe it? I think we've done 900 rallies approximately from the Can you imagine? 900, 900 and one, something a lot of rallies. And it was sad. Everybody was sad. Many people said this is our last rally. But now we're going on to something that's far more important because the rallies were used for us to be put in this position where we can really help our country. That's what we're going to do. We're going to make our country better than it ever has been. And I said that many people have told me that God spared my life for a reason. And that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness. And now we are going to fulfill that mission together. We're going to fulfill that mission. The task before us will not be easy, but I will bring every ounce of energy, spirit and fight that I have in my soul to the job that you've entrusted to me. This is a great job. There's no job like this. This is the most important job in the world. Just as I did in my first term, we had a great first term, a great, great first term. I will govern by a simple motto. Promises made, promises kept. We're going to keep up promises. Nothing will stop me from keeping my word to you, the people we will make America safe, strong, prosperous, powerful and free again. And I'm asking every citizen all across our land to join me in this noble and righteous endeavor. That's what it is. It's time to put the divisions of the past four years behind us. It's time to unite. And we're going to try. We're going to try. We have to try. And it's going to happen. Success will bring us together. I've seen that. I've seen that. I saw that in the first term. When we became more and more successful, people started coming together. Success is going to bring us together. And we are going to start by all putting America first. We have to put our country first for at least a period of time. We have to fix it. Because together we can truly make America great again for all Americans. So I want to just tell you what a great honor this is. I want to thank you. I will not let you down. America's future will be bigger, better bolder, richer, safer and stronger than it has ever been before. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

The American people in the American journey. That's what I mean. He got in the race and naturally they tried to take him out. Iron Man is Donald Trump's enemy. I'm not saying you got a lot Donald Trump. But I'm going to say it's one thing that's unique of this nation. He loves our Constitution. He believes in our freedom. The freedom of expression. The right to bear arms is the second amendment. The one that takes all the others. Yeah. Yeah. Donald Trump in the White House. Yeah. Yeah. I think you'll see a cleaning out. I think you'll see a difference in what you see. Yeah, it's hope. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bring it up. Bring it up. Bring it up. He's going to ring it outside leadership. Some of the best and brightest minds in the country. He's going to bring people to Washington DC to run it like a fist. Not like Washington DC's been ran. But like a business. He's going to manage your money. He's going to guarantee your freedom. He's going to build that wall. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm your turn.

In a sense that whether it's whoever you supported, if it's Ted Cruz or whoever that served it, and we send them watching these things, they could not stop Obama's agenda. They couldn't stop it. They didn't have a leader. I see those men united with Donald Trump and bringing conservative constitutional values back to this nation. That's going to make us great. That's going to make our nation great again. And one thing, chairman of the military and federal government, like I am, Donald Trump loves our veterans. And Donald Trump, that man respects our veterans. He loves our veterans. And we need to put somebody in a wild that will restore that respect for our nation, our Constitution, and our veterans. The man who loves those men is the leader. But y'all show up on November 8th. Y'all following me on Facebook, I'm doing, I'm day 19. I'm 30 days of prayer for our nation. Join me.

And December 30th and Maui and, and, uh, Honolulu and Mike, and on the vacation one year, this year at Saras Loverman and Larry Miller are on the trip with me. It's going to be fantastic. It's great. So get your tickets now. See, I turned that into a plug. Okay. Here are the questions. Christopher, do you feel networks like MSNBC, which are used to work for and use work for? Help or hurt progressive causes? Uh, overall, I think MSNBC in the Trump era has done real damage to the left and I'll be why. And I say that with love. I mean, these are my former colleagues, friends, right? Disfrontal former employee. No, no, that's right. That's a deal. No, I mean, look, a Russia story and what happened there was important. But it was not all important. And they went so far in the realm of conspiracy theorizing, I mean, they had Jonathan Cheydon. Well, it was a conspiracy. But they had Jonathan Cheydon to talk about how Trump may have been a Russian plant since 1987. He may have been. This is ridiculous. Okay. This is way out from what journalistic facts said. And it's to the exclusion of other stories that people actually care about, about health care, about trade, about the future of their lives. Automation. And so, you know, the people who are in the right place are real. And they don't get focused when you only look at one thing. So, yeah, they built up expectations so much that when the report came to help, you were like, oh, it was no big deal. I agree. It was like anything short of key tape was nothing, right? Well, the person who shit the bed was Robert Mueller. He can't even go after the taxes seriously. That's your investigative technique. Don't follow the money. Why did we put our faith in the Republican? He's a Republican. That was the mistake on MSNBC is making him into this hero. This hero and shit the bed. He did the campaign manager, the deputy campaign manager. He let Trump off the hook. He took a memo, a fucking memo, not a law, not in the constitution. Just a memo. We did a whole thing on this. Remember that night? Right after it came out, and he spoke, and I agree with you. But he laid it on a platter for Congress. He just kind of hit Trump. He didn't have to sit down. He's got the taxes. The legal genius of Rudy Giuliani was able to protect Trump from being interviewed by the prosecutor. Exactly. I mean, the whole thing is the taxes. The reason why he may be a Russian asset, in this case the worst businessman ever. So at a certain point, the only people who give money are the Russians. That's, you know, but Mueller didn't establish collusion per se, because that's a technical term. He showed clear coordination between the campaign and the other. I think he did his job. Could he have done more short? Did he do enough? Absolutely. But here's a bit of a fuck to that. And then it comes back to MSNBC, where it was so overhyped, and they're not alone, right? There are plenty of people who were involved in the overhyping of this. But then what he did find, but facts, were not enough for a public that expected, like Barry said, that they were going to get the p-tap. My quick take on all of it was, everything everybody said is absolutely right. But here's the rub at the end of the day. The Democrat in Congress, the media allowed the attorney general to come out and define the narrative before the report was put on the table. Yes. So at that point, folks, it didn't matter what was in the report. That's right. Because we were told there's nothing here. And the report was still hard to follow. What is this bullshit about, like, we did not find that, but it's like, just tell us, okay, Fernand, what is the secret to Democrats winning Florida in 2020? Oh, good, cute. Don't run Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee. There's a socialist in that state where there is no traction there. The Democrats need to do what Barack Obama did in 2012. Go after the Hispanic vote now, start turning that vote. That is the swing state. If they do that, they'll take those 29 electoral votes with them. Who, quick quiz, which of the Democratic candidates polls best with Hispanics? Number one, with Hispanic. Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders. That's right. I don't know Florida, Paul. You may be right about Florida. But you're a little bit more. There's a lot of cupens and there's this tape of Bernie complimenting Fidel Castro. Not really on Castro. He was really, I think, for Nance Parts. You've got to remember how we elect the president of the United States now. And I know it's frustrating for a lot of folks, but Florida is important in terms of what you're saying. Yes, Hispanics, you know, you can find me a poll that says Hispanics support the president of Bernie. I like when you promise it. When you want to proceed, they say that. At the end of the day, we don't elect the president nationally. So I tell people all the times, don't pay attention to the national polls. Play attention to what's going on in the various states. Right. That's what Trump did. That's not what Hillary did. She focused on the big national picture that said she was going to win by this huge number. And he went in and he chipped away because he knew what the electoral number was. He had to get Florida and Texas are key states in this upcoming election. And by 2024, and I'm on the record saying this, the Democrats will have their nirvana because Republicans could potentially have lost, I mean, make it purple on a good day in Texas. And so that's going best in Texas in the most recent poll. And then you're going to be the first. I'm going to be the first to say. I'm going to be the first to say. The number one with Trump Nevada is not going. When that one goes out of Nevada, Nevada is the third of the primary caucus states in February. Right. Number one Bernie Sanders. Okay, let me ask you this. Absolutely. Yes, but I believe that about the top four or five, they could beat him, but Hillary beat him. And we need to crush him. Right. Just beating Trump is going to be good. Well, you got to pay attention to the electoral match because that's where you're going to win. Exactly. I'm going to win with the national strategy. And that's four states. Nevada is not one of them. It's Florida. It's right now. It's Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Those are the magic four. And how do you win Western? How does Bernie Sanders want to be the best of the country? Because he won it by losing Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. Right. So we need to focus first on those three. And Bernie won the Michigan primary. Bernie won the Wisconsin primary. That was just Democrats voting. Yes, but they've he actually. The people he won't even identify as a Democrat for crying out loud. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. Let's say that there are a lot of Democrats running for Democrats. Paul, let me ask this question of our Republican friend here. Because this audience, even though 90% of Republicans are friendly behind Donald Trump, we only see never Trumpers. We see people like you on TV and Nicole Wallace and Steve Schmitt. And we know that the roster. And you're a never-trumper, right? You don't want to break it. No, I don't cast for myself. I am a Republican. And as I say to folks, look, I've been in this party for 41 years. So you could vote for Trump? No. That's a never-ending. That's not it. That's not it. That's not it. It's not in that sense, you know, saying, oh, you know, because I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. And this is important. This is important. Because you wanted to play in that political game when you start creating these kinds of labels. If you're not standing to your point, Michael, if you're not standing for something, which is what you just, you just saw the exchange. Bernie Sanders is a socialist. Or he's not claiming he's a Democrat. And you're like, yes, that's a good thing. When you start using the labels, that works to the advantage of your opponents. So the whole, if you go back and study what happened with the never-truck narrative, right? Trump reveled in that. What he does not like is someone who stands there and says, listen, son of bitch, this is how this is. I believe in these things. Okay. Because of the things I value. That's the fight. Okay. So you wouldn't ever vote for Trump? No. Okay. So even if Bernie Sanders vote for him. Okay. So my question is, what do the never-trumpers do? What do they say? The people on MSNBC who have gone very far left, because look who's giving them their paycheck. What do they say if it's Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren at the top of the ticket? Do they never Trump? Would they vote for him? So would Nicole Wallace vote for... They vote in Mike Bloomberg. They write in Mike Bloomberg. They write, they... Well, that's a bullshit. But I honestly, that's what people said. Yeah, it's all right. Yeah, it's all right. And it was the same thing. It was all wrong. What did we have to vote for? I don't know. But that's partly true. And some will vote for him. There are a lot of folks like Nicole and Joe Scarborough and others who very say, look, I'll vote for the dog in the car. But that's what the Democrats nominated. What is it not that they're like five people? What? This is the never-traum... I mean, I'm just... I know, I'm just... I know, I'm just immune because I see them on MSNBC. And I remember how they used to talk when they were talking... They were talking about the Russian Romney. They didn't even want a barba care. But let's be clear. You're identifying the people that you see on television or read about the newspaper. Trust me. There's a much larger network of folks out there. And this is the rub that gets into the core of what the Democrats have to do this next November. Is how do you make the argument to a center-right Republican or independent candidate? I mean, a voter? To get them to support your candidate, your agenda. Because someone like me, I don't... I can't separate... I say, well, just because you're the candidate who's not Trump, I am all in. I also need to take value and stock of what it is you're going to do. So to Bill's point in your discussion earlier, it matters to me when you say you're going to take away my private health care. It matters to me when you say we're going to open up the borders and give you... That's not what the president is saying. That's not what the president is saying. That's going to be paid for. It's like taxes, like in every other civilized country. You're going to get a lot of things if Bernie is your... I don't really... And you're really giving me stuff like that because it's... But I'm afraid you'll miss someone's idea that the government... You see that the government... Can you pay your taxes? But you have such faith in the government. The U.S. government... Yeah, I agree. Can you really take over? I don't know. Where would government take... The faith in the corporate markets. I mean, Medicare is far more efficient. Medicare is far more efficient than the private health insurance. No, no, no, no. We don't have a demand for the key because... I'm not a corporation. But there's something in between. I mean, Elizabeth Warren always talks about the insurance companies. That's somewhere most of the money. It's the hospitals. Thank you. Somebody has to stop the cow. But it's the profit motive in healthcare, which incentivizes my... But... Thank you for educating us. Sickness is what our profit motive is. But the fructicality of the money... The U.S. government taking over a six of the economy. And it's... I just don't have that kind of... We just don't have that kind of... We just don't have that kind of... Because they already do it. They take over... They do the police force, the fire department, the libraries, the public schools... The military... The military... Talk about a percentage of the economy... Post office. Post office. The government does push up a son... And they might be some pretty good job of it. As long as if it's the government of foreign by the people. If it's the government of the corporations where their corporations are people... That's what we get through. That's what we've got right now. And we need... Look, let's go back to the thing we all agree on... That we have to defeat Trump. If that's job one, that is going to happen. We've put up a street frighten woman or a street frighten man... That is going to bring him down. Otherwise, he will make men's meat of the wrong Democrat... During the campaign. And we cannot let that happen. Okay. We've got to go. Thank you very much, everybody.",

        "transcript": " My name is Ryan Moore from South Sioux City, Nebraska. My family began our friendship with Hillary over 20 years ago. Back then, she was first lady, fighting for healthcare reform. As a person with a rare form of dwarfism, my family knew that my life was going to be filled with surgeries and hospital visits. So, we were grateful when Hillary asked to hear our story. For me, quality, affordable healthcare was more than a privilege, and even more than a right. It was an absolute necessity. I'm thankful that she's kept up to fight over the years, and I'm honored to call her my friend. Here's what I can tell you for my years knowing Hillary Clinton. She's compassionate. Every time I see Hillary, she remembers meaningful details about my life, sometimes from years earlier. When I first met her, I was seven years old and wearing a back brace. Two years later, when I saw her again, she patted my back and said, you don't have a back brace anymore. I could not believe that she remembered that. A lot of people wouldn't have. A lot of people wouldn't have, but she did. She's thoughtful. Every time I have a big operation coming up, I always receive a note from Hillary, full of encouragement and kindness. She lifts my spirits. She helps me believe that everything is going to be all right. Most of all, she's genuine. Something happens when you meet Hillary. No matter how busy she is, and how pretty sure she's always really busy, she makes you feel like the most important person in her day. She blocks everything else out and just focuses on me, how my job is going, how I'm feeling. She really cares. And I know that so many people who have met her over the years say the exact same thing. I wish everyone could get to know Hillary's heart like I have. She always looks out for the little guy, no pun intended. And that's why I'm so proud to support Hillary Clinton as our next president. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " So, so the first time I actually ever stepped foot in this state was actually when I was stationed at Fort Lewis. And so had the chance to come and see the beautiful state of Washington out there. And I just say having to follow Ivan and Andrea and the six graduates in the military, that's what we call an ambush. So whoever set up the schedule, I really appreciate that. And because again, you know, as we saw and as their stories illustrated, this is why this work matters. Because what this work does, this work provides opportunity for many people who didn't even know that that opportunity was even there. This work is essentially a sense of light. And it provides a new pathway and a new level of guidance to those who need and deserve a champion. That's why this organization matters. And that's why you're being here matters. It's because you're putting your flag in this sand. And you're saying, I'm willing to fight for all the others out there. You know, when I first wrote the other Westmore, I didn't understand the way the publishing industry worked. So I didn't realize at that point when I was writing it that when you pick up a book and you walk into a bookstore, you pick up a book, every book that you open, when you open up the book and you flip through the pages, everything you see on the inside of a book, that is what the author wanted to share with the world, those are the author's words, that's the author's intent, that's what the author wanted people to understand, right? Every thing you see on the outside of a book, the cover, the title, the airbrushed author photos, the blurbs, all that kind of stuff that you see, right? That is what the publisher wants to share with the world. The publisher will legally hold on to those rights for a reason. And the reason they will hold on to those rights is because the publisher knows that is their only chance to market. So the publisher will make the author feel like they're part of the process, but frankly, the decision has already been made before the author even has to say, right? I did not know that. I thought publishers genuinely cared about what I thought. So they call me in to this room, this is about six months before the book was set to come out. At that point, it was just called Untitled by Wes Moore, right? Or so I thought, I walk into this room, there's a big oak table, they had all the marketing people around there, and they're like, Wes, what do you think the title of your book should be? And I'm like, you know what? I'm really glad you all asked me because there's like six titles that I really like. And they're like, great, what are they? I was like, okay, what about Baltimore's sons? What about all the difference? What about out of many? What about end of the innocence? Or about life after death? And I started throwing these different titles out. And I looked at them and I said, so you can choose between any of those six titles because I'm good with any of them. And they looked at me and they said, that's very kind of you. But we think we have a better idea. And they said, what do you think about the other Wes Moore? And I said, that might be the dumbest book title that I've ever heard in my life. And they said, what don't you like about it? I said, there's a whole bunch of things I don't like about it. But let me go ahead and start with three. The first thing I told my in like about it was I try to make it very clear that this story wasn't just about these two kids. It wasn't just about one street. It wasn't just about one neighborhood. It wasn't about one city or one demographic or one race or one socioeconomic group. It's about all of us. It's about the decisions that we make and tend to mount to that, the people who we have in our lives who are helping us to make those decisions. So I put in the name inside of the title of the book, are you not completely negating that entire fact, right? That's one. Second thing, I told my in like about it. What self-respected author do you know that puts their own name inside of a title of a book that they've written, right? The other JK Rowling, the other Stephen King, the other James Baldwin, the other, I mean, it sounds ridiculous. And the third thing I told my in like about it, I said, listen guys, no one knows who one Westmore is. So why does anybody care who the other Westmore is? And so I said this to him and they smiled and they's like, those are actually all really good points. And they said the problem though is that you're missing the point. Because you're absolutely right, it is not about you. And it's not about him. The name is completely irrelevant. You can throw any name inside of that book title. It really does not matter because the truth is there are Westmores that exist in every one of our communities. And in every one of our homes. People who are one decision away from going in one direction or going in a completely different direction. People who every day are straddling this line of greatness and the problem is they don't even know it. The most important thing about the title is not the name. The most important thing about the title is the other. The fact that our society is full of others. People who might not look like us, people who might not speak like us, people who might live on the other side of town than us or another part of the country than us. People who might come from a different family lineage than us. But people whose destiny matters as much as the long term safety and security and greatness of our communities as ours does. The others. That's who you all are fighting for. You're fighting for those who need and deserve that champion. That's what you all do. You don't just provide job skills. You don't just provide employment opportunities. You provide freedom. A freedom to dream and know that your dreams won't be laughed at. A freedom to have hope and know that your hopes are actually going to be supported by someone else. A freedom to know that you belong in every single room that you're in, no matter what room that is. That in essence is what made all the difference. And that wasn't about my physical location. It was about the people who surrounded me in every physical location.",

Are you going to lie on the floor? Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. That's that. How about that, John? Okay. The little bity. It's wet. Get in here by eating fine, facing me. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're doing a live interview and 10 seconds. Okay. Mr. Moore, how are you feeling tonight? And how has the campaign been going? Well, the campaign, how am I feeling is incredible. I mean, the support we've had, you know, to be able to mount the kind of campaign we ran and ran the kind of race we've run. We just have the grassroots oil for us and to spend relatively a small dollar and to be blessed the way this campaign has been blessed. I'm just really humbled by the process and by the people they got behind us. I can't explain it, but I'm brave. Okay. Okay. How are the numbers going for you and how are you feeling tonight? I heard the first part of the question. The numbers are going really well. The precincts we're getting in, we've heard really, really well in our home area, well in the river region and even in Houston County we're doing well. So that's, I think, is key for us, picking up those Elmore, Talbot County, Northern District, Montgomery area, and then of course doing well in home. And so far, that's what we're here. So we're really, really blessed and we're excited about what we're here. How hard has your campaign team worked? Well, you know, we didn't really have a lot of paid staffers. You're looking at a campaign that didn't have a general manager. We didn't have a fundraiser. We just had grassroots and a couple of campaign staffers and people that love this and support this and a great social media team. And so, you know, they've worked so very hard and it's a roller coaster, but we learned over the years that it's never as good as you think it is. It's never as bad as you think it is. It's a roller coaster ride, but you just got to trust and walk in faith and that's what we've got. Have you talked to anyone today that's talked about how the voter turnout looked? How the voter turnout looked? You know, I don't, I haven't heard a lot in the areas. I've heard it's been low. So, I assume, you know, I think the Secretary of State said maybe 17%, but we really haven't had. No Pike County was a little low or a while ago. I was shocked by that number, but the rest of the air really haven't heard. I think everybody's just running about 17%. That's a guess. I don't know for sure. What are your next steps if you win? Well, you know, I guess the next step is trying to figure out, you know, how do we get ready to go? And for going into November, prepping our team for that, maybe bringing a few more people on to help us get our message out. And you know, walking faith, that's a lot of what we do. And so, I hadn't thought that far ahead, honestly. Thank you for your time, Mr. Moore. Sure. Morning. Okay, so you just want me to do it right there. I didn't come on. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You I'm standing here and I'm in a total shock. I'm in for a second. I see all that I'm not, but I'm a surprise as y'all. In the year, when he was an artist, I just had a work with him. I can't say that. I've got a little parents meet, I got a lot of people on the other side. I'm on the bed, I'm on the bottom wall, I'm in the car waiting for a lot. It's really been in here. But it will not have how I pray this whole total is praying. You can call the praise of Lord, and we do this because it's an asking. So I am doing again, you know, giving us what I'm about to do. All right, congratulations, very much. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. I was just kidding. And this work, we're going to have a kind of a difficult A.M. and a Pax. You got to let that warm. You got to shout, real loud, put your hands together. And you have to hear me. We're about to raise a hand for the baby. Oh, God, we love you. We thank you Lord, it's your name, this family to do this work at this time. We God that you've been with them and you've directed them. And you've placed your faith on their life Lord. And tonight we give you our God, all body and all the praise and all the glory. And we declare it to them in Jesus name, the strong son of God. And everybody said amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I don't want to try long time, I don't want to miss. I don't want to get off of it. I've got a flash for the two of you. Well, you know, it goes two ways. Sessions, you don't crack on that person, you crack on that person, you crack on that. And then it goes, you double so we trough turn it around and endorse it. So I want to give you a hand. You know what I mean? One is key for my son. One is key for my son. One is key for my son. One is key for my son. I don't think I'm going to give them the keys to life. Sessions, you got to get the keys. I don't want to give them the keys to life. I don't want to take them. I don't want to take them. I don't want to take them. I don't want to take them.

We got a time when we needed to get started. Not yet, the boss man said not yet. I don't know what to do. I have to stand up here for two or three minutes. Let me tell, can I, hey, Jonathan, can I tell the backstory? Not yet. We got to wait eight minutes. This is my boss right here, y'all. It's Jonathan Barbie. This guy we met on the floor of the Republican National Convention and Cleveland O'Hau. He was my alternate delegate. But more than that, we've called this a David and Goliath story. That is my Jonathan. He was my armor bearer. He and his wife, when I tell you they carried the media load for this, this guy didn't charge me hardly anything for what it was worth. It was how we were able to do it. Because he didn't matter on social media. It didn't matter if he had to drive through the night with a van to do a live event. He did it. He's my Jonathan. And so the Lord brought Jonathan in my life at the National Convention at what night's the dental at that time. And for us to be standing here tonight, Jonathan, that's unbelievable, brother. Unbelievable. And so he stays behind the scenes. You rarely ever see him. But I tell you, y'all, he was kind of like a campaign general manager. Am I supposed to call you now? Consultant. Consultant, whatever. He was a jack of all trades in a master. No, that's what Jonathan was. But he was great. And so he and I became fast friends. His wife, actually, during the primary, was walking around the building praying the whole time. Joe, come on up here. Joe, come on up here. So they have become, when you end the churches and you fight and those fights, those battles that those friends become family and they have become family really for us. So anyway, Jonathan, tell me when I can start. All right. All right. Let's go to five minutes. We have five minutes. Oh, we got five whole minutes. So. Any good enough? No questions? Yeah, no questions. No questions. No questions. Uh, yes. I hope everybody voted today. I hope everybody voted today. But anyway, so yeah, it's been an interesting road to hope for us. And so I got to say enough about my family and my friends and, like I said, the team. And we'll talk about those guys a little bit. Randy Higman on the end. And George Trotter. Those two guys. One on 13,000 miles on one of my trucks driving it around. So. Come on up, Fritz. Joey, y'all come on up, man. I also want to fill in up there. We saw it. Y'all come on up. Everybody come on around. Don't worry about the cameras that get what they need. Y'all don't need to be behind the cameras. Y'all need to be happy. Feeling on the side, Joey. Yeah, come on, man. Y'all come on up, brunts. Y'all come on up. Y'all come on up. Everybody come on around. Don't worry about the cameras that get what they need. Y'all don't need to be behind the cameras. Y'all need to be happy. Feeling on the side, Joey. Yeah, come on, man. Y'all come on up, brunts. Y'all come on up. Y'all come on up. Y'all come on up. Y'all come on up. Y'all come on up. Look at Mr. Cove. Woo! Woo! Woo! You're right over there, right over there, right here. I'm going back over there. You're right. You're right over there. Just me. Just me. You're right over there. I'm going back over there. Yeah. Come on. Woo! What doa mani, your heart? Everybody ready? Here we go! MANOr optimism Well And you know, guys, thank y'all so much for being here. It is a blessing to have you on my team and have the support and prayers that we've received. I've got to thank Ketchum's restaurant tonight. Were they not incredible, Daniel? Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Okay, so first thing I'm going to do is read a couple Bible verses. And these were kind of the ones that the Lord just gave us through the fire and over the last 770 days since the last primary. So first Jesus said, look at them and he said, with men it is impossible, but not with God. With God, all things are possible. And that's a Mark 1027. And Psalm 37, which has kind of been, it's the verse the Lord gave me through the most difficult time in my life. But that 2014, if that had not happened, I would not be standing here in front of you today. The Lord just, he'll cut you off to the root sometime and let you build from the ground up. And that's kind of what he did with our family and that's what he did with me and my walk in faith. And so this was a walk in faith. It made no sense to man. But you know, the obedience is counted. It's counted as righteousness. It's greater than, you know, obedience is the greatest thing you do. It's greater than any sacrifice you make. So we always try to walk in obedience. And this was a prayerful campaign. It was a grassroots campaign and God has blessed us. So the second one is Psalm 37, 5, 6. And some of y'all may have heard me read this before. If you watch much network TV, you probably did. It says, commit your way to the Lord. Trust him. And he will do this. He will make your righteousness reward shine like the dawn. Your vindication like the new day sign. And so this to us was about, we just wanted to run a clean race, you know, we wanted to give God the glory. And that's the first thing I wanted to do tonight. That's what we were instructed to do. And at end of the day, I'll tell y'all this, there's a God and we're not him. You know, we're not him. And he could do amazing things. I wrote in my journal a few months ago, it said, an improbability is a possibility. If you don't let your capabilities get in the way of God's availability. And that was a word the Lord gave me. In other words, these impossibilities are always possible if you don't ever limit God. And that's how I approached this. And so he has worked a miracle. This was truly a David and Gly. This was a David and Gly. We were outspent, I don't know. We spent maybe three or four hundred thousand on our race and they spent two or three million. But like I said, improbabilities are possibilities when God's involved. And so I want to thank a few people. I've got to certainly think my wife, Heather. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Chathleen, this is my daughter. Youngest Trump delegate in the nation, by the way. Claudia. Woo! Woo! Jeb, he's a caboose. And Jeremy. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! My mom and my dad, my mom is a, she's a prayer warrior. She's behind me here somewhere, I'm sure. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! My mother-in-law, I tell y'all when she prayed over me, she lives with us and she prayed over me often. And I felt those prayers. I mean, sometimes she would actually come down the morning when I was doing my Bible study and pray over me. And so that gives you a certain amount of comfort when you're going into battle, you know, that you're covered. And you're covered in the blood. And so we've had just so much support and prayers. And so of course, Sherry McCormick, about the only true page. Sherry was a super hard worker, you know, super hard worker. And about the only full-time paid staffer I had the whole time. She was just grassroots. You know, we've always believed that you, if you campaign among the people, you will govern for the people. But as you campaign from an ivory tower, you will govern from an ivory tower. And so Sherry was good at getting out and meeting people. And meeting needs, you know, when we got shut down with the COVID-19, we served people. We helped people. And so she's been big in that. Randy Hickman, I mentioned earlier, Mr. George Trotter. No body. These guys, I don't know where they find their energy, but these guys bring it. When I tell you they bring it, Mr. George would be calling you yelling on the phone about he got you two votes today. And Randy was just, Randy was up there wearing a wheels off of that truck. He peeped 13,000 miles. He drove that truck. And so just with a very more sign in the back of it, you know. And so just down the line, Shagler pride, Shagza. Yeah. Woohoo! Woohoo! Oh, Marine. Oh, Marine. My treasure. Steve Cape, Henrietta. Mr. Lewis Coles. Where's Mr. Lewis Coles? Right here. Yeah. Woohoo! That man right there drove me when we were working really, really hard for endorsements. We drove many a night. So I think we did 15 counties and meetings. And he drove me. And just drove me. And encouraged me. We had some good nights and some bad nights. His jokes get old after a while. He'll tell you the same story over and over. Andy Carver. Yeah. Johnny McCoy, Frank Wilts. Those are veterans. Those are the guys that worked so hard for the veterans in northern part of the district. Scott and Don Johnson. Miss Sue Newwine. I don't know if she's left yet or if she's still here. Miss Sue Newwine. Applause. It's Sue's fault that I stand before you today. She got me in the politics in 2008. She asked me to consider serving. And I went to the state house at that time. So it was her fault. John O'Roberts, Carol Bolston, Miss Virginia Howard's a prayer warrior friend of mine. God, they're all wonderful. Shannon Smith and her family, those kids, and they have worked so hard. I think they were waving signs today for us. So Mr. Jim Coles and then Andy Gamble. And Andy Gamble, Mickey Beverly Jordan. Tyler Burns. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler was kind of, he was a Johnny come lately. I mean, we hired him. He had worked hard on it. I guess a couple of races and y'all were in good shape. And so he reached out to us. And he worked at northern part of the river region. You see how sunburn he is? That's from walking door to door and waving signs and 100 degree day in and day out. And Emily helped him a lot. They did a wonderful job. My brother, Novi Bracken, y'all don't hurt him. Prayers, he here tonight. Novi don't like any kind of tension, but he's called to the Lord of what he does. And he just helped God us. When I tell y'all we ran a perfect campaign, we ran a perfect campaign. But it wasn't anything we did. It was the Lord's God us through Novi Bracken and Prayers. And he would give me words about not to go negative. He would tell me how to approach it. And so that's Novi was the God. He was my prayer warrior, my buddy. And he gave me peace at times when I didn't always have it. So anyway, so Novi, Randy Hard is not here, but Randy's a good friend of mine. He's a prayer warrior. And I'm sure we'll see him eventually around, but dear friend of mine, Bill Harris. Bill here is the other. He had to go back north. Bill's a good conservative guy from the northern part of the district. And he was my, I guess you say Joshua. He's the one that got me to step into 2018 and run. He said, he said, Barry, you know the Lord didn't park the water till the priest put the feet in the water? That was Bill Harris. And so we ran, I told Heather that day I said we're going to step in this congressional race and run against an incumbent. But we felt called to do that. Have we not laid the groundwork in 18? We would not be standing here in 2020. So the Lord, he'll build you that way. He'll start you in 14. He brought us through 18. And then he called us into this thing again. In 20, we're like, Lord, really? But you know, he's been faithful. And I, when I see a garbage man from Baton's Crossroad, Alabama, going to Congress and standing up here talking to a bunch of people and TV cameras, that tells you that we're living one of the greatest nations in the world. And we're going to be here. Man. There we are. We were against seven candidates in the primary. Seven people. Y'all know how discouraged and that can be. Especially when one of them's got $2 million. That can be discouraging. But you know, it was just we stepped in and we ran and we worked hard and here we are. And so I tell you, we're still the greatest nation on earth, but things like that. Tiffany Tata, one of my pair of warrior friends, and then Jason Howles, a prayer friend of mine. He's down the panel of Florida, but I met him a long time ago. He's a spirit-filled man. OK, my media warriors, they worked so hard. Y'all, we knew that grassroots was key. We knew that's how we would get the load out. And so that's what we did. They worked so hard. So I want to thank them. And Wendy and John, Sexton, Monica Howard, and Sean, Wendy Penson, Dorothy Robbins, volunteer over in the Do thing area. All my employees at BMI, they kind of held the fort down. All I did is. Yeah. APPLAUSE Warren Byron, his wife and his family have always supported and safe come to everything. And of course, Paul Daz, he's worked so hard. So Paul's kind of one of my guys. He shows up and he'll go door-knock, do whatever you ask him. Do he'll ride with me and drive me? And that helps a lot too. So anyway, I just want to thank y'all so much. And tell you this, Jonathan Brother, I love you. You've been my armor bearer through this thing, man. And so he has been a, I tell you, nobody has worked any harder than him to help us match the big money. And we did it without the big money, because of his hard work, him and his wife, and so. Guys, I appreciate y'all being here. And I can't tell you, it hadn't hit me yet, and we did this. And honestly, as much as you like to trust the Lord, sometimes you still go, Lord, are you sure about this? You know what you're going to say? But he has been so faithful and he's been so gracious. And so thank y'all, I love y'all. I love our community. And the president needs a little help. I've been with him since the day one, and I tell you this. Y'all keep me in your prayers, because I told the kids early on, I said, the winning this race and running this campaign, that's the easy part. Going to DC and facing the kind of stuff that we've got going on in this country, it's a spiritual battle for the future of the nation. I just tell you all that. It's not Democrats, it's not race wars. It's a spiritual battle for the future of our country. We've got to have men who are willing to bend the knee and look to heaven. And it's stand up and fight. And so that's what we're going to do. And so y'all keep us in your prayers. And God bless you. We love you guys. And I don't know what else to say except, I love you and I appreciate it. I'm serious. I'm serious. I'm serious that I didn't need to get a shout out to my veterans. The veterans really got out and worked so hard for us. They're soldiers anyway, but they were great foot soldiers. And so me being a veteran, me and only veteran in the race, that's been tremendous support for me all over the district. And so thank you guys. God bless you and y'all have a good night. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's get a picture with the roof. Yeah. Happy family Christmas. All right. Look. My mother. are ready. Go. You guys say it land. He said. We are ready.

Unless I want me just to go back. You know what I mean, right? I'm gonna do this thing. Oh, I'm telling you, I'm gonna go out there. I'm sure not all the women there. Oh, no. We got a new job.

        "transcript": " Thank you very much. Sorry to keep you waiting, complicated business, complicated. Thank you very much. I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard fort campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and Independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one United people. It's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past of which there were a few people. I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. I've got to know our country so well, tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will be. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We have a great dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred, great guy. Fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great unbelievable parents. Tamalania and Don. And Ivanka. And Eric. Antiphany. And Baron. I love you, and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty, and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. That's so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us, and he went through meetings. Hey, that Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is it? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie folks was humble. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington, because he's as smart as you get, senator Jeff Sessions. Very smart. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who was that? Is that the mayor of the chair-decker? That's Rudy. Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor, because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson. Where's Ben? Where's Ben? And by the way, Mike Cuckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family, Sarah, thank you very much. General Mike Flynn. Where is Bob? And General Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign, and there's special people, and it's really an honor. We have 22 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. We have just tremendous people. A very special person who believed me, and I'd read reports that I wasn't getting along with him, I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. That's right. How did you possibly guess? So, let me tell you about Rines. I said this. I said Rines. And I know it. I know it. Look at all those people over there. I know it. Rines is a superstar, but I said they can't call you a superstar, Rines, unless we win. Because you can't be called a superstar, like Secretary it. If Secretary it came in second, Secretary it would not have that big beautiful bronze bus at the track at Belmont. I'll tell you, Rines is really a star, and he is the hardest working guy. And in a certain way I did this, Rines, come up here. Where is Rines? Get over here, Rines. Boy, oh boy, oh boy. It's about time you did this, Rines. Oh my God. That's how you work. Come on, say something. Ladies and gentlemen, the next President of the United States, Donald Trump. Thank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God. Amazing guy. Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we've done. So I also have to say I've gotten to know some incredible people, the Secret Service people. They're tough, and they're smart, and they're sharp, and I don't want to mess around with them. I can tell you. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down to the sea, but they are fantastic people. So I want to thank the Secret Service. And law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight. These are spectacular people, sometimes underappreciated, unfortunately, but we appreciate them. We know what they go through. So it's been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job. And I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. I look very much forward to being your President, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, maybe even eight years, you will say so many of you work so hard for us, but you will say that you will say that that was something that you were really were very proud to do. And I can thank you very much. And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. We're going to get to work immediately for the American people. And we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your President. You will be so proud. Again, it's my honor. It was an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period. And I love this country. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you to Mike Pence. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.",

We are proud to present such a deserving recipient with the 2016 BET Humanitarian Award presented by State Farm, Jesse Williams. Please, please, thank you, Deborah, thank you, BET, thank you, Nate Parker, Harry, and Debbie Allen for participating in that. Before we get into it, I just want to say, you know, I brought my parents out tonight, I just want to thank them for being here, for teaching me the focus on comprehension and over-career that they make sure I learn what the schools were afraid to teach us, and also to thank my amazing wife for changing my life. Now, this award, this is not for me, this is for the real organizers all over the country, the activist, the civil rights attorneys, the struggling parents, the families, the teachers, the students that are realizing that a system built to divide and impoverish and destroy us cannot stand if we do. All right. It's kind of basic mathematics, the more we learn about who we are and how we got here, the more we will mobilize. Now, this is also in particular for the black women in particular who have spent their lifetimes dedicated to nurturing everyone before themselves. We can and will do better for you. Now, what we've been doing is looking at the data, and we know that police somehow managed to de-escalate, disarm, and not kill white people every day. So, what's going to happen is we are going to have equal rights and justice in our own country, or we will re-destructure their function and ours. Now, I got more, yeah. Yesterday, it would have been young Tamir Rice's 14th birthday. So, I don't want to hear anymore about how far we've come when paid public servants can pull a drive by in a 12-year-old playing alone in a park and broad daylight, killing him on television and then going home to make a sandwich. Tell Ruki a boy how it's so much better to live in 2012, and it is to live in 1612 or 1712. Tell that to Eric Garner, tell that to Sandra Blan, tell that to Dorian Hunt. Now, the thing is, though, all of us in here getting money, that alone isn't going to stop this. All right, now, dedicating our lives, dedicating our lives to getting money just to give it right back for someone's brand on our body, when we spent centuries praying with brands on our bodies, and now we pray to get paid for brands on our bodies. There has been no war that we have not fought and died on the front lines of. There has been no job we haven't done. There's no tax they haven't levied against us, and we've paid all of them. But freedom is somehow always conditional here. You're free, they keep telling us. But she would have been alive if she had enacted so free. Now, freedom is always coming in the hereafter. But you know what, though, the hereafter is a hustle. We want it now. And let's get a couple things straight, Mr. Lois, side note, the burden of the brutalized is not to comfort the bystander. That's not our job. All right, stop with all that. If you have a critique for the resistance, for our resistance, and you better have an established record of critique of our oppression. If you have no interest, if you have no interest in equal rights for Black people, then do not make suggestions to those who do. Sit down. We've been floating this country on credit for centuries, you know, and we're done watching and waiting while this invention called whiteness uses and abuses us, burying Black people out of sight and out of mind while extracting our culture, our dollars, our entertainment like oil, Black goals, ghettoizing and demeaning, our creations, then stealing them, gentrifying our genius, and then trying us on like costumes before discarding our bodies like rinds of strange fruit. The thing is, though, the thing is that just because we're magic doesn't mean we're not real. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " You can't say it, but you know it's true. Good evening, everybody. It is an honor to be here at my last, and perhaps the last White House correspondent. You all look great. The end of the republic has never looked better. I do apologize. I know I was a little late tonight. I was running on CPT, which stands for jokes that white people should not make. It's a tip for you, Jeff. Anyway, here we are. My eighth and final appearance of this unique event. And I am excited. If this material works well, I'm going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year. Earn me some serious tubbments. That's right. My brilliant and beautiful wife, Michelle, is here tonight. She looks so happy to be here. That's called practice. It's like learning to do three minute planks. She makes it look easy now, but next year at this time, someone else will be standing here in this very spot. And it's anyone's guess who she will be. But standing here, I can't help but be reflective. A little sentimental. Eight years ago, I said it was time to change the tone of our politics. In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific. Eight years ago, I was a young man full of idealism and vigor. And look at me now. I am gray and grizzled. I'm just counting down the days till my death panel. Hillary wants questions whether I'd be ready for a three-year-in phone call. Now I'm awake anyway because I've got to go to the bathroom. I'm awake. In fact, somebody recently said to me, Mr. President, you are so yesterday. Justin Trudeau has completely replaced you. He's so handsome. He's so charming. He's the future. And I said, Justin, just give it a rest. I resented that. Meanwhile, Michelle has not aged today. The only way you can date her in photos is by looking at me. Take a look. Here we are in 2008. Here we are a few years later. And this one is from two weeks ago. So time passes. In just six short months, I will be officially a lame duck. Which means Congress now will flat out reject my authority. And Republican leaders won't take my phone calls. And this is going to take some getting used to. It's really going to... It's a curveball. I don't know what to do with it. Of course, in fact, four months now. Congressional Republicans have been saying there are things I cannot do in my final year. Unfortunately, this dinner was not one of them. But on everything else, it's another story. And you know who you are Republicans. In fact, I think we've got Republican senators Tim Scott and Cory Gardner. They're in the house, which reminds me security bar the doors. Judge Mara Garland, come on out. We're going to do this right here, right now. It's like the red wedding. But it's not just Congress. Even some foreign leaders they've been looking ahead. Anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathroom. That was a slap in the face. A clear breach of protocol. Although while in England, I did have lunch with her majesty, the Queen, took in a performance of Shakespeare, hit the links with David Cameron, just in case anybody is still debating whether I'm black enough. I think that settles the debate. I won't lie. Look, this is a tough transition. It's hard. Key staff are now starting to leave the White House. Even reporters have left me. Savannah Guthrie, she's left the White House press corps to host the Today Show. Norodonel left the briefing room to host CBS this morning. Jake Tapper left journalism to join CNN. But the prospect of leaving the White House is a mixed bag. You might have heard that someone jumped the White House fence last week, but I have to give Secret Service credit. They found Michelle brought her back. She's safe. She's safe back at home now. Something I'm more months, baby. Settle down. And yet somehow, despite all this, despite the churn, in my final year, my approval ratings keep going up. The last time I was this high, I was trying to side on my major. And here's the thing. I haven't really done anything differently. So it's odd. Even my AIDS can't explain the rising poll numbers. What has changed? Nobody can figure it out. I'm not going to say anything. Puzzling. Anyway, in this last year, I do have more appreciation for those who have been with me on this amazing ride. Like one of our finest public servants, Joe Biden. God bless you. Love that guy. I love Joe Biden. I really do. And I want to thank him for his friendship, for his counsel, for always giving it to me straight, for not shooting anybody in the face. Thank you, Joe. Also, I would be remiss. Let's give it up for our host, Larry Wilmore. Also known as one of the two black guys who's not John Stewart. You're the South African guy, right? I love Larry. And his parents are here, who are from Evanston, which is a great town. I also would like to acknowledge some of the award-winning reporters that we have with us here tonight. Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Leah Schriver. Thank you all for everything that you've done. I'm just joking. As you know, Spotlight is a film, a movie, about investigative journalists with the resources and the autonomy to chase down the truth and hold the powerful accountable. That's fantasy film since Star Wars. I look at that. That was maybe a cheap shot. I understand the news business is tough these days. It keeps changing all the time. Every year at this dinner, somebody makes a joke about buzzfeed, for example, changing the media landscape. And every year, the Washington Post lasts a little bit less hard. It's kind of a silence there. Especially a Washington Post table. GOP Chairman, Ryan Spreebus is here as well. We're glad to see that you feel that you've earned a night off. Congratulations on all your success. The Republican Party, the nomination process, it's all going great. Keep it up. Kendall Jenner is also here. And we had a chance to meet her backstage. She seems like a very nice young woman. I'm not exactly sure what she does. But I am told that my Twitter mentions are about to go through the roof. Helen Mirren is here tonight. I don't even have a joke here. I just think Helen Mirren is awesome. She's awesome. Sitting at the same table, I see Mike Bloomberg. Mike, a combative, controversial New York billionaire, is leading the GOP primary and it is not you. That has to sting a little bit. Although it's not an entirely fair comparison between you and the Donald. After all, Mike was a big city mayor. He knows policy in depth. And he's actually worth the amount of money that he says he is. What an election season. For example, we've got the bright new face of the Democratic Party here tonight. Mr. Bernie Sanders. Bernie, you look like a million bucks or to put it in terms you'll understand. You look like 37,000 donations of $27 each. A lot of folks have been surprised by the Bernie Finalina, especially as appeal to young people. Just recently a young person came up to me and said she was sick of politician standing in the way of her dreams. As if we were actually going to let Malia go to Burning Man this year. What happened? Bernie might let her go. Not us. I am hurt though, Bernie, that you've been distancing yourself a little from me. I mean, that's just not something that you do to your comrade. Bernie's slogan has helped his campaign catch fire among young people. He told the burn, feel the burn. It's a good slogan. Hillary's slogan has not had the same effect. Let's see this. I said how much I admire Hillary's toughness, her smart, her policy chops, her experience. You've got to admit it though. Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. Dear America, did you get my poke? Is it appearing on your wall? I'm not sure I'm using this right. Love and Hillary. It's not entirely persuasive. Meanwhile, on the Republican side, things are a little more... I'm not sure we say this. A little more loose. Just look at the confusion over the imitations to tonight's dinner. Guess we're asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish. But instead, a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan. That's not an option, people. Steak or fish. You may not like steak or fish. But that's your choice. Meanwhile, some candidates aren't polling high enough to qualify for their own joke tonight. The rules were well established ahead of time. And then there's Ted Cruz. Ted had a tough week. He went to Indiana. Who's your country? Stood on a basketball court. And called the hoop a basketball ringer. What else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks. Football hats. But sure, I'm the foreign one. Let's go. Well, let me conclude tonight on a more serious note. I want to thank the Washington Press Corps. I want to thank Carol for all that you do. The free press is central to our democracy. Now, I'm just kidding. You know I'm going to talk about Trump. Come on. We were just going to stop there. Come on. I'm going to stop there. Although I have a little hurt that he's not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time. And it is surprising. You got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras. And he says no. Is this bitter too tacky for the Donald? What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What's he doing? The Republican establishment is incredulous that he's their most likely nominee. Incredulous, shocking. It's a Donald Lex, the foreign policy experience, to be present. But in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world. Miss Sweden. Miss Argentina. Miss Azerbaijan. And there's one area where Donald's experience could be invaluable. And that's closing Guantanamo. Because Trump knows the thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground. All right, that's probably enough. I've got more material. No, no, no. I don't want to spend too much time on the Donald. Following your lead, I want to show some restraint. Because I think we can all agree that from the start he's gotten the appropriate amount of coverage, befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. I hope you all are proud of yourselves. The guy wanted to give this hotel business a boost. And now we're praying that Cleveland makes it through July. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. As for me, Michelle, we've decided to stay in DC for a couple more years. Thank you. Miss Sweden, our youngest daughter, can finish up high school. Michelle can stay closer to her plot of carrots. She's already making plans to see them every day. Take a look. But our decision has actually presented a bit of a dilemma, because traditionally, the President's don't stick around after they're done. And it's something that I've been brooding about a little bit. Take a look. The Obama's are staying in DC for two years after the President League's office. He's about to go from Commander-in-Chief to couch commander. You check top. What am I going to do in DC for two years? I'm going to get rid of the London Mr. President. I can't go every day, can I? I wish you liked better these. Or these. Joe, they're the same. They captured different movies. Joe, I need some focus here. Come to the near to the near to the time. I'm sorry, what's that? I said Mr. President, you had to be practical. And look, you can drive again. You're going to need a license. You love sports. Why don't you volunteer to work for one of the teams around here? Is this a Washington Wizards? I'm going to give him some coaching help. Let's just say I coach my daughter's team a few times. Hello. Hello. Already four? Finally. So I'm going to be in DC for a while. And I thought I'd take a driving again. What's the name? Barack Hussein Obama. Thanks. Well, since you don't have a driver's license, you're going to need a burst certificate. Really? Really. It's real. Is that? It's real. Buddy. It's real. Oh, Michelle left her phone. Sit here. Huh. She's got Snapchat. Well, BalaCare is great. And it's really working. Sign up now. Breaking news. Michelle Obama in hot water after posting this video earlier today. ObamaCare is great. And it's really working. Sign up now. No? No. Did I get a lot of views? Honey, enough. Why don't you just talk to somebody who's been through this? I got to go to the sole cycle. She's right. I know who I need to talk to. Hey. It's Barack. Listen, can we get together? Now that is a great move. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So, you got any advice on that? So now you want my advice? First, stop standing me all these LinkedIn requests. And second, here's the beauty of this whole thing. You've got all the time in the world to figure this out. You can just be you for a while. If you're not a dude that again. So I can just be me. And I can wear my mom jeans and piece. I hate these tight jeans. Yeah, good. The afternoon, I had a beer at 11.30 in the morning. And you know, McDonald's now served breakfast all day long. You know, Michelle's going to be at spin class, so she'll never know. Right. Let it go. You know, it won't be long. You'll be able to walk right out of the oval office singing. Zip-Doo-Dawz, Zip-D-A. And you got plenty of time to work on your tent. And you know what? I finally got the grand bargain on a sweet, Chevy Toppil. Look here. Look here. Yeah. What a bargain. We're going to be using the little bargain for our cabana on a 347th round of golf for the year. And it's totally great. And Gloria, not a problem for anybody. I can't think of a reason to care, Wolf. And believe me, I've tried. There you go. I am still waiting for all of you to respond to my invitation to connect to LinkedIn. But I know you have jobs to do, which is what really brings us here tonight. I know that there are times that we've had differences, and that's inherent in our institutional roles. It's true of every President and his press corps. But we've always shared the same goal to root our public discourse in the truth, to open the doors of this democracy, to do whatever we can to make our country and our world more free and more just. And I've always appreciated the role that you have all played as equal partners in reaching these goals. And our free press is why we once again recognize the real journalists who uncover the horrifying scandal and brought some measure of justice for thousands of victims throughout the world. They are here with us tonight, Sasha Fyfer, Mike Resendez, Walter Robinson, Matt Carroll, and Bedbrand Lee Jr. Please give them a big round of applause. Our free press is why, once again, we honor Jason Resign, as Carol noted. Last time this year, we spoke of Jason's courage as he endured the isolation of an Iranian prison. This year, we see that courage in the flesh, and it's a living testament to the very idea of a free press. And a reminder of the rising level of danger and political intimidation and physical threats faced by reporters overseas. And I can make this commitment that as long as I hold this office, my administration will continue to fight for the release of American journalists held against their will. And we will not stop until we, they see the same freedom as Jason had. At home and abroad, journalists like all of you engage in the dog and pursuit of informing citizens and holding leaders accountable and making our government of the people possible. And it's an enormous responsibility. And I realize it's an enormous challenge at a time when the economics of the business sometimes incentivize speed over depth. And when controversy and conflict are what most immediately attract readers and viewers. The good news is there's so many of you that are pushing against those trends. And as a citizen of this great democracy, I am grateful for that. For this is also a time around the world when some of the fundamental ideals of liberal democracies are under attack and when notions of objectivity and of a free press and of facts and of evidence are trying to be undermined or in some cases ignored entirely. And in such a climate, it's not enough just to give people a megaphone. And that's why your power and your responsibility to dig and to question and to counter distortions and untruths is more important than ever. Taking a stand on behalf of what is true does not require you shedding your objectivity. In fact, it is the essence of good journalism. It affirms the idea that the only way we can build consensus, the only way that we can move forward as a country, the only way we can help the world mend itself is by agreeing on a baseline of facts when it comes to the challenges that confront us all. So this night is a testament to all of you who devoted your lives to that idea, who push to shine a light on the truth every single day. So I want to close my final White House correspondence dinner by just saying thank you. I'm very proud of what you've done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy. And with that, I just have two more words to say. For Bama up. Bama up.",

        "transcript": " Oh Thank you all thank you so much You know it's it's hard to believe that it has been eight years since I first came to this convention To talk with you about why I thought my husband should be president Remember how I told you about his character and conviction His decency and his grace The traits that we've seen every day that he served our country in the White House I also told you about our daughters How they are the heart of our hearts the center of our world and during our time in the White House We've had the joy of washing them grow from bubbly little girls into poised young women A journey that started soon after we arrived in Washington When they set off for their first day at their new school I will never forget that when or morning as I watched our girls just seven and ten years old Pilates of those black SUVs with all those big men with guns And I saw their little faces pressed up against the window and the only thing I could think was What have we done? See because at that moment I realized that our time in the White House would form the foundation for who they would become And how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them That is what Barack and I think about every day as we try to guide and protect our girls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight How we urge them to ignore those who question their father's citizenship or fake How we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not Represent the true spirit of this country How we explain that when someone is cruel or acts like a bully you don't stoop to their level No, our motto is when they go low we go high With with every word we utter With every action we take we know our kids are watching us We as parents are their most important role models and Let me tell you Barack and I take that same approach to our jobs as president and first lady because we know that our words and actions matter Not just to our girls, but the children across this country kids kids who tell us I saw you on TV I wrote a report on you for school Kids like the little black boy who looked up at my husband his eyes wide with hope and he wondered Is my hair like yours and Make no mistake about it This November when we go to the polls that is what we're deciding not Democrat or Republican not left or right no in this election and every election Is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives And I I am here tonight Because in this election there is only one person who I trust with that responsibility Only one person who I believe is truly qualified to be president of the United States And that is our friend Hillary Clinton That's right See I Trust I Trust Hillary to lead this country because I've seen her lifelong Devotion to our nation's children not just her own daughter who she has raised to perfection but But every child who needs a champion Kids who take the long way to school to avoid the gangs Kids who wonder how they'll ever afford college kids whose parents don't speak a word of English but dream of a better life Kids who look to us to determine who and what they can be You see Hillary has spent decades doing the relentless Thankless work to actually make a difference in their lives Advocating for kids with disabilities as a young lawyer fighting for children's health care at first lady and For quality child care in the Senate and when she didn't win the nomination eight years ago She didn't get angry or disillusioned She Hillary did not Hillary did not pack up and go home Because as a true public servant Hillary knows that this is so much bigger than her own desires and disappointment So So She proudly stepped up to serve our country once again as Secretary of State Traveling the globe to keep our kids safe and look There were plenty of moments when Hillary could have decided that this work was too hard That the price of public service was too high that she was tired of being picked apart for how she looks or how she talks Or even how she laughs But here's the thing What I admire most about Hillary is that she never buckles under pressure She she never takes the easy way out and Hillary Clinton has never quit on anything in her life And When I think about the kind of president that I want for my girls and all our children That's what I want I want someone with the proven strength to persevere Someone who knows this job and takes it seriously Someone who understands that the issues of president faces are not black and white and cannot be boiled down to 140 characters look because Because when when you have the nuclear codes at your fingertips and the military in your command You can't make snap decisions You can't have a thin skin or a tendency to lash out you need to be steady and measured and well informed I want a president With a record of public service someone whose life's work shows our children that we don't chase fame and fortune for ourselves we fight to give everyone a chance to succeed and And we give back Even when we're struggling ourselves because we know that there is always some work one more soft and There but for the grace of God go I I Want a president who will teach our children that everyone in this country matters a President who truly believes in the vision that our founders put forth all those years ago that we are all created equal each a beloved part of the great American story and When crisis hits We don't turn against each other now. We we listen to each other we lean on each other Because we are always stronger together And I am here tonight Because I know that that is the kind of president that Hillary Clinton will be and that's why in this election I'm with her You see Hillary understands that the president is about one thing and one thing only It's about leaving something better for our kids That's how we've always moved this country forward by all of us coming together on behalf of our children Folks who volunteered to coach that team to teach that Sunday school class because they know it takes a village Heroes of every color and creed who wear the uniform and risk their lives to keep passing down those blessings of liberty Police officers and the protesters in Dallas who all desperately want to keep our children safe People who lined up in Orlando to donate blood because they could have been their son their daughter in that club Leaders like Tim Cain Who show who show our kids what decency and devotion look like Leaders like Hillary Clinton who has the guts and the grace to keep coming back and putting those cracks in that highest and Hardest black ceiling and so she finally breaks through Lifting all of us along with her That's is the story of this country The story that has brought me to the stage tonight The story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage the shame of servitude the sting of segregation But who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done So that today I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves And and I've watched my daughters Two beautiful intelligent black young women Playing with their dogs on the White House lawn And And because of Hillary Clinton My daughters and all our sons and daughters Now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States So look So Don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great That somehow we need to make it great again Because this right now is the greatest country on earth And And as my my daughters prepared to set out into the world I Want to leader who is worthy of that truth a Leader who is worthy of my girls promise and all our kids promise a leader who will be guided every day By the love and hope and impossibly big dreams that we all have for our children So in this election We cannot sit back and hope that everything works out for the best We cannot afford to be tired or frustrated or cynical No hear me between now and November We need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago We Need to knock on every door We need to get out every vote We need to pour every last ounce of our passion and our strength and our love for this country Into electing Hillary Clinton as president of the United States of America So let's get to work Thank you all we got blessed",

        "transcript": " Good afternoon, everyone. We do apologize for the delay. My name is Gina Ford. I am the communications director for Prince George's County Executive Angela also Brooks. As you are aware by now, we were notified last night about our first positive COVID fourth positive COVID-19 case. And so today the county executive Dr. Carter are here to bring the latest details. So first you'll hear from county executive also Brooks followed by the Prince George's County Health Officer Dr. Ernest Carter and then Dr. Monica Goldson the CEO of the Prince George's County Public School System. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all so much for joining us today as we share. So very important updates with our community. I first want to again by thanking all in county government who have worked tirelessly to make sure that we do everything we can to preserve the health and safety of Prince George's. I also want to thank Prince George's themselves for their patients who since yesterday have had to wait for us as we gather to to to be able to provide the most accurate and up date up to date information possible to our community. I want to acknowledge those who are standing with me this morning. I first want to thank Dr. Carter who is our chief health officer who you will hear from in just a moment. I am also joined by county council vice chair Calvin Hawkins. I want to thank him and the rest of the council for their support. Dr. Monica Goldson who is our CEO of our Prince George's County Public Schools is here and she will address you. Ronnie Gill director of our office of emergency management and they have been working around the clock as well as fire Tiffany Green who is here this afternoon. Late yesterday evening we were notified by the Maryland Department of Health that a resident of Prince George's County tested positive for COVID-19. This is the fourth confirmed case for our county. The individual is a man in his 60s who is currently hospitalized. I would like to ask that all of us together continue to keep him, his family and everyone impacted by this virus in their prayers at this time. Our county health department is working with the state of Maryland to conduct that investigation and we will provide updates to our community as we have it with more information. In reference to this latest case I can tell you that there are also potentially 12 firefighters who could have been exposed to COVID-19. The department is following its policies and procedures to regarding self-evaluation of those firefighters and we will continue to monitor their conditions. In addition as many of you know Prince George's County Public Schools was notified yesterday that an individual affiliated with Eleanor Roosevelt High School in College Park Academy had close contact with someone who traveled to a country under a high risk coronavirus warning and as in a precaution both schools are closed today March 12th and tomorrow March 13th for cleaning and sanitizing. Students and staff will return Monday March 16th. You will hear from Dr. Goldson in a moment but what I should say especially to all of our parents and students is that we will in every instance make a decision that we believe is in the best interest of all of our students and staff and that their health and safety is our first priority and that we will be making decisions that are out of an abundance of caution in every instance. Our health department is conducting an investigation and gathering important information from the individual relating to the school and we will keep the public informed about that. There will be a telephone town hall tonight and Dr. Goldson will provide further updates about that town hall. As we saw yesterday COVID-19 is becoming bigger and bigger issue. The World Health Organization officially declared this virus worldwide pandemic recognizing how quickly it has spread across the world. Even more last night the MBA officially suspended their season recognizing the potential impact and spread of this virus in large crowds and confined spaces such as a stadium. The good part for all of us is that everyone can do their part to contain this virus. The easiest thing to do is to take several easy everyday actions such as washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds and we're asking people to please cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or arm. I'll let Dr. Carter discuss this in more detail but there are prevention methods and the one that we are really stressing today is social distancing. This is really important that we practice social distancing and Dr. Carter will talk more about what that means. I especially want to stress that these recommendations are especially critical for particular parts of our community. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some of our residents are more at risk of potentially contacting COVID-19 such as our seniors and those who suffer from chronic medical conditions. Those medical conditions include long and hard disease as well as kidney disease and we advise those individuals to please take extra precautions. This means that if you do not have to go out in public, especially large crowds to please avoid it, we're asking that you also avoid contact with those who are sick and that you wash your hands often. Also to have access to several weeks of medications and supplies. There are also some quick things that you can do to plan ahead in case you become sick including please stay in touch with others, develop a contact list of friends, family and neighbors and if you have a caregiver determined who can provide care if your caregiver gets sick and also always listen to your body if you are sick, call your health provider and discuss your symptoms. As a community, we must come together at this time most especially to look out for our seniors and others who are at risk to ensure they're safe and health. I can't say it enough that our seniors truly are at risk in this and so we're asking all Prince Georgeans to follow some actions to support and take care of our seniors. Let's just make sure that during this time we are taking care of each other. Please reach out if you were able to check on our seniors to make sure that they are okay. Consider for some of them who now will feel uncomfortable and who it quite honestly will be advised against places with large volumes of people such as the grocery store. It may be a good thing to check on those seniors to see whether you might be able to bring to them some of the groceries or medications or other supplies that they need in order to reduce their time in public and if you have a loved one in a care facility, monitor the situation and call in to check on them and the facility rather than visiting in person. So this is a rapidly evolving situation. It is very important that every Prince Georgeans stay informed. We will continue to provide you updates but you can do this in a number of ways. Call our hotline at 301-883-6627. You may also visit our website at health.mypgc.us. Backslash coronavirus. You may also follow us on social media at C-E-X also Brooks. And we have a few other updates about these resources. First, our coronavirus hotline will now be open for extended hours including on the weekends from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. We are actually and you but you can always call it the hotline but we're actually the first coronavirus center in the state to open on weekends. We are going to continue to do that as the need arises. In addition, I want to let the public know that we have unfortunately learned that there are a number of fake websites floating around on the internet to try to scam our residents and so we want people to be vigilant about that as well and to be very careful about the messages that you get on on social media. That's why it's important to really stick to as closely as possible websites like the one that the government posed or call our hotline to ensure that the accurate that the information you're getting is accurate and credible and to protect the safety of yourself and your loved ones. We've been printing fact sheets and other information to distribute and we'll be mailing it out as well but we want to recommend that our residents please only call 911 for emergencies. Please preserve that we're getting really inundated there but for general questions or concerns about the coronavirus you can call our hotline which again is 301-883-6627 and we want you to know above all that we care that the county government is here. We're working to ensure that every Prince Georgian is healthy and safe and that we will take appropriate steps at all times to provide to you the latest updates that you need so that you are aware of what is happening in the county. Working together if we all do our part we really do believe that we can help to prevent the spread of this virus and contain it and we thank all of you again for for staying tuned and for doing your part to make sure that we contain this virus that we stop it and that we protect those in our community who are most vulnerable most especially I'll say it and keep saying it please our seniors and those who suffer from chronic medical conditions let's make sure that we're reaching out to them and doing what we can to help. So at this point I will turn over the microphone to Dr. Carter who is the chief health officer for our county. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. The coronavirus COVID-19 is in our community. So we need to team up now. We need to make difficult but necessary adjustments to our lives and our activities. Our county government residents businesses and other critical partners across Prince Georgian County must work together to defeat this disease COVID-19. So far COVID-19 has shown to be very resilient. The virus has rapidly made its way into the United States but more importantly it has shown to be a deadly virus. The latest data shows that the coronavirus mortality rate is about 15% for people who are 80 or older. I'll say that again. The latest data has shown that the coronavirus mortality rate is about 15% meaning 15 out of every hundred people who are over 80 who get the coronavirus. It gets to them. We're also discovering people who are 60 or older as well as people who have severe chronic medical conditions are more likely to be very sick from coronavirus. As we continue to learn more about the virus this remains an evolving situation. Our public health experts across Prince Georgian County and the world are working overtime to get more answers about the coronavirus. Those answers will continue to give us the best guidance for how we can win the battle. But we can't do this alone we need to come together as a county to do our part to keep ourselves and our neighbors healthy and informed. The CDC recommends people minimize close contact and avoid crowds. You have to use your best judgment when it comes to modifying activities and events. If this means canceling a postponing your event so be it. We must protect the health and well-being of our communities. That's where the major adjustments in our life begins. You'll be hearing a lot about social distancing. This means limiting your participation and the distance you keep between folks when you're in a gathering. When out in public try to maintain a distance of six feet of more from others. Whenever possible. Avoid shaking hands and hugging you know Prince Georgians we love to hug. I know that's tough for us to do. But that's an important moment. Social distancing will keep up will help us slow down the spread of the disease. Right now we're anticipating an increase in cases in the county and the state. To reduce the spread we must reduce the number of people who get exposed to coronavirus. Remember coronavirus spreads person to person. That happens when somebody within six feet of you coughs or sneezes and dispenses the respiratory droplets in the air. These droplets can land in your mouth or your nose of other people. Are probably being in probably getting held into your lungs. As we speak the health departments experience and dedicated infectious disease control experts are working extremely hard to gather all the important information from our confirmed coronavirus patients and the people that they've been in contact and around lately. That means right now we're gathering information and we're making trying to determine what the risk exposure is in our county. We are monitoring the situation and we're receiving every update from the state in the CDC and we're communicating with our counties that are around us. One thing I have to emphasize we must continue to practice excellent and consistent personal hygiene. What is that? Washing your hands often with soap and water at least 20 seconds. If you don't have soap and water use a hand sanitizer. If you don't have a hand sanitizer at least have a solution of 60% alcohol when you're washing your hands. Cover your coughs and sneezes. Try to keep your hand out of your face which is very difficult for me but I'm doing it. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you're sick stay home except to get medical care. It takes anywhere from two to 14 days to start feeling symptoms after exposure. These symptoms are fever of 100.4 or higher cough and difficulty breathing. If you develop these symptoms and if you have concerns you have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19 contact a medical provider. Please stay up to date with us through our website and social media accounts look out for each other. Really look out for each other. Yes COVID-19 is resilient so are we as long as we take care of ourselves and each other. I'd like to thank you and at this time I'm going to hand it back over to Dr. Goulson. Thank you. Good afternoon. On yesterday I made a decision to close Elinerozovald High School in College Park Academy for today and tomorrow so that we could sanitize and deep clean those two facilities. It was brought to my attention that an individual affiliated with those two schools had close contact with someone who traveled to a country under a high COVID-19 warning. And so I made a decision as a precaution to make sure that those two facilities are cleaned. That does not mean that that person affiliated with those two schools had tested positive. In our effort to make sure that we also practice social distancing we have updated some of our practices and made changes. Before we I share those things I want to share that on our main web page we have updated information about COVID-19 so please feel free to check our website which is updated daily. We have asked parents to make sure that they check their school max online module to make sure that their contact information is updated as well as their emergency contact information that's located in schools. We have initiated scheduled hand washing at the elementary level every day and a constant reminder to our secondary students to frequently wash their hands. We have relaxed our attendance policy for students who are sick. We ask the parents to please keep them home and no need to get a doctor's note as that they please just create a note when they return from their illness so that we can contact them. We have canceled the following. No international travel or out of state travel. We are canceling international teacher exchange programs. Out of state and local overnight trips are canceled. Out of state and local conference attendance has been canceled. And out of state field trips including Virginia and the District of Columbia effective tomorrow will be canceled. We will continue to monitor field trips within the state of Maryland on a daily basis. As stated earlier I will be hosting a tele-town hall tonight from 630 to 730 pm. Parents and employees will receive a phone call at 630 so to join the call they simply just have to answer the call and follow the prompts. And if you are not a parent or an employee and you'd like to join in please visit our web page so that you can get very specific call and number so that you two can join the tele-town hall. We will have a specific line to support our Spanish speakers as well. As stated earlier I will continue to monitor our situation daily. I am a parent and an employee and a leader of the school district and always look at every factor involved with our 136,000 students and 22,000 employees. And we will continue to make decisions to make sure that our staff and our students remain safe. Thank you. All right. With that we will take any questions. At this current time there is no evidence that this particular person traveled. So this is more than less likely and of course we're still in the investigation stage. But it seems like this is probably a community required. Best way to get exported is honor investigation from the hospital community. That's not. Could you talk to this please about the protocols now with the first responders who may or may not have that sort of contact. What does that call about? I'll actually agree. Okay so we may first say this. Our friends work with County Fire and Invest Department is ready to handle this incident. We lean forward in January to make sure that our policies and procedures were in place. We ensure that we have the PPE or personal protective equipment necessary for our firefighters to be able to run these calls and to be able to be successful. The policies and procedures that we fall following our normal infectious control policies and procedures. We are working with the department to make sure that we investigate the entire incident. All 12 of the firefighters have been contacted and at this time are being self-evaluated. If for whatever reason they experience any signs and symptoms that is directly related to COVID-19 they'll follow their normal procedures of notifying the health department and at that time we'll evaluate it. Are they getting self-evaluated? At this time all 12 firefighters are at home and they are supporting. At this time it's been investigated. It's an active investigation and it's changing daily but we're working with the health department to evaluate that and if at any point we decide that we need to expand it we will. There were three potential contacts. At this point the investigation did reveal that we did have some firefighters that were potentially exposed to the positive COVID-19 patient. That's correct. What is the procedure for people being in shape? If they have symptoms and you know that's cough or if they have a fever of over 100-4 or if they have shortness of breath they should contact their physician. And they can notify us but it's their physician who has to make the determination of whether or not they should be tested. How is it they take you you know they take them into the lab you get dead like any other test. Yes there's a swap yeah I'm sorry. It's very simple. It varies that's number one. It can be 24 hours it can be up to 72 hours. You can imagine that the state labs are getting a lot a lot of tests right now. So it varies depending on you know the rate that they can turn around but for the most part they turn it around in about 48 to 72 hours. Who has got to ask two questions. Yes. First of all can you describe condition of the individual with their serious whatever that's possible. The second thing is on this testing issue as a local official. Is testing providing you the data and you need to determine whether or not community spread is occurring. Well the date from the data from the test. Well no actually the investigation will tell us about whether it's community spread or not. Okay that's number that's one and the other one you asked me. So it's a characterized condition in the individual who's been diagnosed with. I can't because I honestly right now haven't seen the medical record. I know it's serious. It's not it but I don't know what where you know whether it's whether he's coming getting better and better or whether he's getting worse and worse. We that's under investigation at this time. Can we use the trial serious condition? I wouldn't. I wouldn't use it at this time because not until I get confirmation from the medical facility and we didn't what we what we came to find out was that he was hospitalized and that you know and he this is an individual who we have to and because he is a senior we have to take a really close look at. So when they call when they let us know we'll let you know. Okay Dr. the last use force. I'm sorry. Spawning events. Youth schools that are school related. Leads all that kind of stuff. What's going on in the schools is going to know that. Thank you for that question. We actually are now reviewing our athletic and performance events for our students. What I can tell you is the Maryland State Department of Education. We're in the process of playoffs at this time and those will be closed athletic events that will be housed at the University of Maryland in Towson today through Saturday. Only those athletes and their parents will be able to attend. And based on that information we'll be in consultation with the county government to determine our next steps. My goal is to be able to give our community information related to that by this evening's tele-town hall or tomorrow morning. Right. In the next course, the campus system did close. What was that process like? I don't know why the decision and what it looked like after. Would it be on online courses? Would it be? It looks like home and campus for the government. That seems to be the most common question that we receive is what would happen. And in our case really, honestly, we'd have to have a more heightened number of cases where we honestly thought that we needed to seclude our students and our staff in a location to help to reduce the exposure rate. We're not at that point at this time. We are in constant conversation with our community partners, meaning our health department, our county executive daily, and my team meets every evening so that we can assess every situation that's brought to our attention. But in the event that we have to close for approximately two weeks, and I say two weeks because that is the amount of time that we have been told could potentially lead to exposure of self-quarantine time. Our staff will provide instructional practice for our students to receive at home, but we will not be implementing remote learning. And the reason for that is because I have 82,000 students who are in front of reduced meals, and I cannot guarantee that every child has technology and has access to the internet in order to continue that instructional program. We have received direction from Maryland State Department of Education in the event that that does have to happen, then we will have to be in the position to make that time up, either extending the school day upon our return or extending the school year. Well, first let me say the distinction between universities and public school system. Our universities have many students who come from across the nation, not only the United States but several countries, and I understand they're heightened in concern and empathize with their needs of want to make sure that they keep those students safe. I also know the communities that my children come from and where they live and reside. And as I stated earlier, I have 60% of my population who's on free and reduced meals. So we're in constant conversation with the Capital Area's Food Bank to make sure that in the event that I do have to close. I want to make sure that those students and families still are being fed. We provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner in many of our schools, and so for me to automatically, quickly, quickly to make that decision does not allow parents an ample time to make sure that they get the supplies that they need so that they can continue to protect that child at home. And lastly, just want to reiterate what our Dr. Carter has stated, the population that is most prone are seniors. I have the opportunity to serve 136,000 students, and though 8,000 of them are seniors, they're seniors in high school. They are not senior citizens. And so it is my goal to continue to protect them and the seniors and my teachers who serve them. And at this point, we have no indication from our health department, our county executive, and other agencies that we're at a point that we need to close the school system completely. Okay, thank you everybody. I'm sorry, if you have a question, you were calling about Sunday, your attention to the school has been thousands of students at press, or calls, calls, where it passes. What is the message for teachers? So we just finished, we concluded a conference call that we actually had with over 100 pastors this morning. And Dr. Carter was on that call and he said some very important things. We are first of all in a different phase. I think that's important to take away from this particular press conference, because that we are in a different phase in terms of the transmission of this virus. And the reason that we believe that is because the fourth case here is distinguishable from the first three. The first three cases that were positive in our county are individuals who we could trace, travel outside the region, outside the country. The fourth case is a different case. It's different because we cannot, as far as we know, trace travel. This is a gentleman who for the most part, stayed home, didn't have, did not travel a lot. And so we're concerned. We cannot trace at this moment, like we could with the first three. And so this means that we are in a different state. And so what we said to our pastors and I will allow Dr. Carter, if you'd like to elaborate on this, is that we have to take extreme precaution at this point. We are advising, especially for older, our older residents and for those with chronic medical conditions, that we advise that those individuals take precaution, including remaining out of large crowds. We believe that it is risky and extremely dangerous to do that. And so we are advising, especially our residents who suffer who are older or who suffer from those chronic medical conditions, lung conditions, heart disease, kidney disease, that it is inadvisable and dangerous to be in large crowds. That is the guidance that I have gotten from our chief health officer from the Centers on Disease Control, who give this guidance right now. And like I said, we believe you move from one phase to the next where it was important for us to give this information now, given that the fourth transmission was one that was very different from the first three where we could chart travel or something else. And this one is a little different. So Dr. Carter, I agree with everything the county executive I think that this particular positive case gave us pause because we can't find exactly this person had a travel history. And when I say we can't find, he we found out that he hasn't been traveling and if there is any possibility he had, we're still investigation. But the probability that he traveled was very very low from our initial investigation. Remember, we've only had a few hours. But we feel like this particular case is different and that's why we had this time come forth and the county executive was absolutely correct. This is a shift in how we start to approach things. I think that's why when I was talking we have to do this together. This isn't a health department dictating. This is not what the health department is doing for you all. This is what we're doing together. This is a social responsibility as part of my mission. And that third layer of my mission says I have to make sure that everybody in this county takes responsibility for prevention, disease and accidents. Anything that could cause them to have to be unhealthy. So I'm going to be pushing to make sure that we do that. So I thank you. That's all. Is that it? Anything else? Thank you all.",

        "transcript": " Good morning. I'm Muriel Bowser. I'm the Mayor of Washington, DC. I'm joined today by the Prince George's County Executive, Angela also Brooks, our neighbor. We are also joined by the Chiefs of Police for the Metropolitan Police Department and the Prince George's County Police Department. We're here today in Marvin Gaye Park. We are on our border between Washington, DC and Prince George's County to talk about how our jurisdictions are working together to address disturbing spikes and gun violence, specifically as it relates to car jackies. We are particularly concerned about how many young people are involved in these crimes. On our side, in the DC side, MPD made 132 arrests for car jacking in 2021. And out of that 132, 85 of those arrestees, of those arrested were under 18. We know that the stats in Prince George's County are similar. The county executive will talk about the 152 arrests made for the same offenses with 86 juvenile being part of that number. And when we share a border, we know that crime doesn't recognize borders. We also know that our kids involved in crimes in DC and in Prince George's County are crossing the border. DC kids in Prince George's, Prince George's kids in DC. We have talked in the past about how this pandemic has upended our ecosystem and upended our communities. And it's obvious to that crime has been impacted. Part of our work with teens and adults is to reengage or use, make sure they're engaged at school, after school activities, sports, and work. And all of those things to make sure they're staying on the right track. We have been successful in scaling up our D.Y.R.S. programs and our human services programs. And you've heard the chief talk to you already. We're also making sure and looking for increased ways to ensure that everybody is being held accountable through our public safety and the justice ecosystem. And so I want to be very clear that when we talk about accountability from every part of our, every part of our system, we're not going fingers or placing blame, but we're asking everybody to step up and step up like we're going to talk about doing today. So that's why I'm saying to pay attention to any new laws being considered or the ones that's on the books, pay attention to prosecutions and sentencing to make sure that when young people use guns, that the outcomes we know can be tragic and we have to prosecute and hold young people accountable if they're not following the law. And while we are also always interested in creative sentencing solutions, and in fact we've invested in a lot of diversion programs. Deferred sentencing agreements that don't include services and supervision just don't make sense. So we want our communities to be safe for everyone for the vast majority of our children who are doing the right thing each and every day for moms, brothers, kids, grandmums that are going back and forth leading their daily lives to be safe. And so that is what we want to be focused on, every part of our ecosystem doing what it needs to do to keep our community safe. With that, I want to turn over to our county executive from Prince George's County and our friend and neighbor Angela also works. Good morning everyone. I want to first begin by thanking Mayor Bowser for being here today and thank her as well for her leadership and for the amazing partnership that we share. I'm so grateful for it. And we're here today as she mentioned to talk about an issue that has become so serious, not only for Prince George's County, but we're here because this issue also is very serious in Washington DC, along with other communities all across the country. As the mayor mentioned, Carjacken, along with other violent crimes of up in the Washington Metropolitan region, we've seen an increase in Carjacken since the pandemic began in 2020 and in 2021, Carjacken's continued to rise. Even more troubling as you refer juvenile arrests have outpaced adult arrests. Children between 12 and 17 years old are responsible for a significant portion of the increase in Carjacken that we're seeing both here in the district and in Prince George's. These young people committing Carjacken are not from one place. Young people from Washington DC and Prince George's County are crossing line to commit offenses contributing to a rise in violence all across our region. This is an extremely serious issue, which is why our county is committed to working with Mayor Bowser and the district to fix this rise in violent crime. Preventing crime, and you've heard this already, by children, children committing crime isn't just one person's responsibility. As we work in government with the courts, the police department and each other, we cannot hope to solve this problem with these tools alone. What the numbers tell us is that our complex and interconnected society, our ecosystem is damaged. And when an entire ecosystem is damaged, we need everyone involved to come to the table to fix it. The blunt truth is that our children are angry. Many of our children have been emotionally traumatized. And as we well know, hurt people, hurt people. To depravity, the sheer depravity that we are seeing in the crime to be committed are a reflection of what these children are experiencing both at home and in the community. They must be healed and they must be held accountable. And as we repair their ecosystem, then we will be able to see our children here. Be clear, the government can't do it alone. These police officers who work so hard day in and day out can't do it alone. The courts can't do it alone. We need everybody to step up. These families have to step up. The children's parents have to step up. The community has to step up. And we need our faith, leaders, everyone in the community has a responsibility to making sure that our children are healed. And Prince George is what I can tell you is that I've been working directly with our courts to create a strategy that will help address this problem. I want to thank Judge Tillerson Adams, who is our chief judge, and thank the system for working with us. What we understand is that our children have rights. And we want to keep them out of the judicial system whenever possible. But as adults, we have a responsibility to protect them from entering a life of crime. And we have a responsibility to ensure that our neighborhoods are safe. As elected representatives of our community, we have a responsibility to protect our residents. Be clear, are you have rights and so do their parents, their grandparents, uncles, and the rest of our community. Parents should be able to drive to work without worrying about having their car stolen. These children's grandparents should be able to pick up food without fearing for their lives. No one has happened to Prince George's County. We had an older man who went to a gas station. He was a costidere. He was a car jack. He was stabbed. And not only was he stabbed up about his upper body, he was stabbed in the eye and lost his eyesight. No one should be able to have to go through this. And so we are, we've after me, handed car jackers as young as armed car jackers, 12 years old. And so we understand that our government has an obligation to promote both justice and freedom. We've talked a lot about justice, meaning that we want to make sure that what happens is fair and transparent and that the rights of our children are respected. And we demand to have freedom. The freedom to go to the grocery store without being a costidere. Freedom to drive into your driveway in the in the in the front of your home without being attacked. The freedom to go about your daily life. And so we want both justice and we want freedom. And as we work on crime prevention strategies, we ramped up our focus now on reducing violent crimes committed by our children. This past spring and summer, we work to engage our youth. Many of whom have been deeply impacted by the pandemic. We also wrote summer passport experience and our summer youth enrichment program provided our children healthy, constructed outlets and safe opportunities to socialize. Now we're ramping up efforts also to reduce violence and to engage our youth and young adults through our county's hoping action anti-violence project. And I want to thank Pastor Tony Lee and the community of hoping all of our faith leaders who have come together to help us in this effort. We launched this program in late October of last year. And this will help prevent violent crime through our focus on targeted care designed to interrupt cycles of violence that we've seen far too often in our youth. The program will use four strategies. We're working with peacekeepers, incredible messenger, messengers to prevent violence before it can start. We're combining diversion and reentry services which offer first time and recurring non adjudicated youth offenders assistance along with the state's attorney's office. We're using community and school-based wraparound services to offer aftercare for our children after school enrichment programs mentoring our food insecurity. We're dealing with case management and access to in-school peer support groups. And our fourth strategy is a work group called the violence prevention task force. This task force is currently being formed. And what's membership is that the youth will meet and identify areas of critical need. And work to develop short and long-term strategies to reduce violence. This group will also help us identify the concerns and needs of our families, including the needs at home. And we understand why this is so important. You can't heal children without also healing their families. And so we're going to be asking that task force to look at the needs of parents to find out what our mothers need, what their fathers need, what their families and what their support systems need to be successful. We're currently accepting applications for this task force. And I encourage all of our residents in Prince George's Council to step up and apply help out and help us. We're also in the process of reviewing grant applications that we've received from nonprofits and community organizations for hope and action. These groups will partner with us to provide greater programming for our youth. And so what we are doing is everything in our power. I know the mayor is doing everything in her power as well to reverse, arrive, and violent crime, and to provide our youth a safe and stable place to grow up. But understand this, Mayor Bowser and I cannot stand here and coordinate. We can't work with this with the police community and with others without the also the work of our communities without the collaboration and cooperation of our community. The truth of the matter is that this will not be resolved at the police station. Be clear, it won't be resolved at the courthouse. It is not going to be resolved alone by the government. It will require our entire communities to get involved. Parents, families, community leaders, this is how this will be resolved. And we wait for it to be resolved at the courthouse. It will never happen. If we expect it to happen at the police station, it can't happen. This cycle must be broken in our communities. And that's the reason that we're here today is to ask everyone in our community to continue to be engaged in this. The Mayor and I will continue to work together. We'll continue to work with our chiefs of police and we will hear from today. We're going to be working with everyone. But this has to end. It absolutely has to end. And again, we must heal and hold accountable the young people who are committing these activimes. Thank you so much. And I believe in here we have Chief Conti. Good morning, everyone. You know, this morning before coming out here, I was really kind of reflecting on the issue that we were building with. And I've been talking with Chief of the first year of his county about some of the things, some of the tactics that we were to really build a path. And we're going to talk a little bit about that today. But, you know, I really have to give credit to the mayor and the county executive because it really can't be put in more purpose than what's already been said. We have to be able to hold people accountable. We have to give services. We have to do all of that. But we have to hold people accountable for the actions that they are committing in our communities that impact me, it impacts everyone that's up here and it impacts all of you and all of you who might be watching this. You know, I have a saying, people respond differently depending on their proximity to the pain. When it happens in your block, in your neighborhood, it's your mother, your brother, your sister, your father who gets car jack, people respond differently. And I've been on this police department long enough to recall back in the early 90s when car jacking was an issue in our city. And in many cities across the United States. And as a result, I believe it was a death that occurred in Howard County as a result of a car jacking where changes came about then. And what did those changes look like? Those changes came in the form of holding people accountable. Those changes came in the form of not letting people be out in community who are committing car jackings. Not letting them be in community. How often have community members heard me say, people can't car jack if they're not out in community. And as I've looked at the stats from chief of Z's from Prince George County and what we're seeing here in the District of Columbia, it's exactly the same thing. It's the same thing. Over a hundred kids in the District of Columbia arrested for car jack. Over a hundred kids arrested in Prince George County for car jacking. Where do young people write now? Are they receiving the services that we hope that they should receive? Where are they now? They're in community. I assure you they are in community. And when they are in community, it becomes very difficult to ensure that accountability happens the way that it's supposed to happen. Let me tell you something. Playtime is old. This is not a video game. This is not a game where we've planned chicken and we're not going to figure out what it is we need to do here. The Mayor and the County Executive have already stayed with. We got to come together and everybody. This is not a spectator sport. Everybody has a responsibility here. Community members have a responsibility. Courts, judges, the police department, people who prosecute case, all of us have a responsibility. I'm pleading to the community as a father, as a responsible father. I do not allow my children to cut up in the house and do things and then I send them outside. They may go in their room. They may have to sit down for a while, but there's accountability that comes along with the love that I give them as a father. We have to challenge ourselves. Are we really showing our children love by allowing them to car jack, put a gun in somebody's face, and then send them back out in community and we call that love. If that's love, I don't want no part of that. And you should not want a part of that. We should want better for our children. And sometimes the reality is that our children are in not so good situations at home. That is the truth. And when they're not in good situations at home, why are we so in a hurry to put them back in a situation that's not good for them that allows them to car jack people. Last year we had 456 car jackins in our city. And yeah, we can arrest people and arrest people and arrest people, but are the children receiving the things that they need, the healing that they need? Is that happening? And if it's not one night, we've demonstrated leniency. We said, we arrest less people. We do all these things. Things are going to get back when we've arrested less people. We've increased the number of kids that have been arrested for car jacking to the one outpacing the number of adults that have been arrested. Look back, I challenge you. Look back and look at what the penalty is for adults when they car jack. Why is that penalty what it is? Why did car jackins go dormant for so long? If it calls for commitment, then it causes for commitment and commitment in the form of sitting somebody's young people down because when their friends see them car jacking and they're back out in community the next day, what's the motivation for their friend not to do what they do? Like I said, playtime for games is over. And we all have to come together and take this issue for the serious issue that it is. And not wait until there's a loss of life. Oh, I see him the recall, we had a loss of life last year with respect to young women who project a man last year. Last year, I formed the car jacking task force in the district of Columbia last year when we called this issue out last year. And here we are a year later. What has changed in the system, what we know that has changed in the system is that the number of arrests has been and went up. But the rest of the system, we must look at that to see where are their opportunities for improvement as the mayor mentioned. This is not an exercise and finger point. But if we can sit here or stand here and say that we all don't have a responsibility in this, then we're fooling ourselves. We are fooling ourselves. It is not going to get corrected by a government program or the police locking everybody up. It's going to take all of us to get things the way that we want them to be. So just really quickly, a couple of things I want to talk about. The car jacking task force, the Metropolitan Police Department started last year. We're building out that out and we're expanding our car jacking task force because it has demonstrated at the very minimum that we can connect cases that we can take people into custody and we can lock them up for the car jackens that they commit and commit. First thing, in addition to that, we are committed to increased collaboration to address the regional issue through cross-border initiatives with our partners here in press jordas county. As chief of ziz now looked over the people who are being arrested and you look at the number of people who are being arrested in the district of Columbia and also being arrested in press jordas county, it's the same kids. It's the same kids. But you can't go into a DC code or press jordas county court and talk about what they did over in the other jurisdiction. There should be fundamentally there's a problem with that. There's a problem with that and we have to make sure that collectively that problem is being addressed. The other part is the cross-border initiative. Many years ago we did a cross-border working with our partners at press jordas county police department. The chief not reviving that, but we want to have Metropolitan Police officers and press jordas county police officers working the borders of the district of Columbia because oftentimes what we see are young people committing crimes and they head straight for the board. They head straight back to home base, home base being in DC or home base being in press jordas county. So we want to shore up our partnership there and make sure that we have a very robust intelligence sharing strategy. Some of the specific tactics and things that we will do behind the scenes obviously we want to talk about those things but I will assure the community that we will work at with press jordas county and spare no expense what we expect to do and the things that we need to do to hold young people accountable and make that information public. Make that information public about the rest that have happened and what's happening with those arrests and why would suggest that community members do is follow these cases through the system. If you see somewhere along the wild with things and not being held accountable as they should be then that should be a question that community is raising. Are the penalties and are the things that are happening with this particular individual with this particular incident that happened or just in general is it does it marry up with what you believe should happen when a person carjacks somewhere. I know what it is for adults. Right now we're talking about young people specifically because of the sheer numbers of them. The sheer numbers of them and the reality is right these cases they're not really they have not been moving through the system. So those are the key things that I wanted to touch on really quickly. I got a little excited up here because you know I'm just really passionate about this this issue and I'm going to I'm you know I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to just turn turn these comments over and not worry about it but if you take away nothing else that I say I'm appealing as a parent as a daddy first as a daddy first what do you want for your child. What do you want for your child because see here's the other sad reality that people won't talk about see I get to see it the chief get to see it when these young people progress through these crimes and we're not holding accountable I end up standing over top of when they did and how can we help them that right I end up standing over talking because they did because the average person that is arrested for homicide in the District of Columbia 11 times they've been arrested prior to their homicide and in many cases the victim is the same story so when we want to jump when do we want to jump in and help do we want to jump in and help on on the front end of this thing or do we want to get in you know again when chief Conti has to stand up with chief disease at a press conference and talk about the sad life that's been lost and all that kind of stuff when are we going to start taking this thing seriously it's a collective effort and I appreciate the community support to make sure that we are holding people accountable when these types of crimes are committed in our communities thank you so much chief Conti I think you you heard chief Conti and the passion that he speaks with and I think it was a well-warned chief of the leaders that I stand beside here I don't know how I could say any words to reiterate more the importance of standing here today to talk about this issue at hand I heard my county executive talking about the rehabilitation and sometimes you have to rehabilitate people on the inside and today show that they can live properly among us on the outside and I heard the mayor talk about it's not thing of point and it is not thing of point but it is what chief Conti said about accountability so when will we hold everyone to the same accountability in which we are here and that is an important statement to make first I'll cover some some issues here or some items and then I'll expand on it and I want to first start by thanking my county executive Miss Angel also Brooks the DC mayor Bowser and my friend and compadre chief Conti but a partnership and exemplary leadership on the critical issues addressing violent prime especially card jackens they've outlined our jurisdictions are seeing an increase in card jackens and unfortunately more and more juvenile are committing these violent crimes in 2021 alone we had 393 card jackens 393 card jackens 12 year old card jackens we arrested 66 adults and 86 juvenile so far in 2022 that trend continues more juvenile arrests than adults and this cannot continue our communities deserve to be safe and the juvenile committing these crimes they deserve a brighter future but they also deserve accountability in Prince George's county to tackle his growing number of card jackens we've established our card jacking in addiction units when our first arrived here we noticed that card jackens were on the rise and even as far as last week I was looking at some statistics and I went back to the 90s and in the 90s it said we had a card jacking problem and that was interesting and then it got to the mid 2000s and it said we had a card jacking problem and that was interesting but what was not noted was the numbers after that that said that we resolved those issues then and even now we can resolve these issues now through hard work and resolve through that determination when we centralized our card jacking investigations team and assigned the team of talented detectives and leaders who are strictly dedicated to reducing these crimes through these cases and we are seeing some success since September that unit has made more than 90 arrests the unit could not close this many cases without a strong relationship with our partners at DC police I'm from Texas so let's call out here yeah they gave me some handw almost but they didn't seem to be working the see how this collaboration works the communication between our agencies is around the clock and effective in addition to our card jacking in addiction unit the PGPD's gun intelligence unit is hard at work to investigate each arrest for those who commit gun crimes or the commission of gun crimes and our county and in our jurisdictions the unit is focused on neighborhoods with see an increase in shootings and violent crimes involving guns the unit's job is to identify the shooters and build cases for state or federal prosecution since September they've also been tasked with reviewing firearms and cases in the county and following these cases throughout the judication in 2021 PGPD we recovered 1,399 guns and made 941 arrests so arresting is not the problem arresting is not the problem the community often calls upon us to make a arrest and we've done that you called upon us to make less arrests and we've done that so what is the next step in resolution we realized that we want to arrest our way out of any issue but we remain committed to supporting programs like the Office of Community First the police athletic and activities lead things like my county executive mentioned with hope and action with past belief and inside of this are stats that would sound astounding except to police chiefs like me and chief conti cajacans in Prince Jarges County in 2019 we had 93 cajacans and 21 juveniles were arrested and 2020 we had 263 cajacans and 77 juveniles were arrested in 2021 I mentioned we had 393 cajacans and then we're arrested 86 juveniles out casing adults and so far can add those together we went over 100 arrests for juveniles we've had just 11 so far this year of juveniles involved in cajacans which seems to be an amazing statistic except to people who see this every single day the people you see behind you we're no stranger to these to these numbers the juveniles that we are seeing involved in these cases young people who have no fear of the consequences that are involved meaning they have no fear of accountability at Prince Jarges County and Washington DC we share more than just the border we share a joint future a collaborative mindset and we seek a safer place to live and work and play to shop to be entertained in that safe environment our collaboration on our cross-border initiative resulted in the successful apprehension of suspects involved in the cajacans of the candidate for DC council without that collaboration we would not have arrested that individual and led us to more information involving homicides that's where the projection goes cajacans to homicide chief con TNI and the leaders you see before you we will continue to work with our criminal justice partners and an accountable way in this system to keep focusing on accountability so we can share the common resolve to keep our residents safe by working side by side and we will interject our sales and what I call this vicious cycle and this vicious cycle that often revolves around poverty being born in a certain situation in a certain part of town and getting a certain education which is poor and attending a poor school and getting a poor job and then introducing your kids inside that cycle while we introduce programs to help you become accountability and on the other side then we interject our sales and not just standing here singular and alone and by ourselves that we must enjoy our other partners that revolve in this system that we are just one cog in this wheel and that one cog in this wheel from policing to the state attorneys and district attorneys through commissioners to judges to NGOs from from from charities to people in the community for re-entry for rehabilitation that if we don't act as a collective fist as a collective entity and a collective ecosystem then we we'll fail so again we stand here to call on that accountability from young people that they will see consequences to their actions for taking a gun and put may gun to someone's face and taking their property without consequences without fear that we will hold accountable our partners in this criminal justice system that we go 100% to what we say we do best and with that I will conclude thank you so much. Thank you. I want to thank all of the speakers count and the county executive and I will take a few questions with the chiefs. Also before I do that I want to thank all the men and women of both departments who are working under outstanding leaders to to make sure that we're keeping our community safe. So what what I heard and all of the comments who said we need everybody to step up in their lane and and do our jobs we also need to focus on how we heal our young people and hold them accountable and then that is the basis of real love and commitment to their future so I'll start here. Channel nine. All right Megan Ripper-Streer from Channel nine. Chief County mentioned that for a while you didn't see a lot of car jackings in DC and now that that member has spread to juveniles and outpacing two to one do you think that older people are putting younger people up to these crimes because the punishment is not severe for juveniles as it is for adults. Chief. Certainly there could be a case of that you know a one-off but in general no it's not that. I mean we've seen young people who commit car jackings just for the fun of committing the car jacking. They have friends who see them do it they do it we've had young people committing car jackings and while they're being pursued by the police they're live streaming themselves laughing right at as they have committed their car jackings so I don't think that it is a thing of people putting up other young people up to it I think that we have a system in place right now that allows people to young people to engage in this type of behavior and the consequences have been very many. Brad Bell is Channel nine. Hey where where is the failure? I'm also Brooks I mean in Princeton or just county there's one judge that handles all of the juvenile cases we're hearing stories of the same juvenile being arrested over and over and over again for car jackings. Where is the failure you're talking about accountability cogs in the wheel chief is a crazy abuse whose it well you know it's hard to say that there's any one part of the system what I've said is that the entire ecosystem is broken I think the act speaks for itself all of it's broken you know we have children who are not only committing one offense after the next you heard the chiefs say that they have no fear that they mock the system we also know that hurt children hurt other people and so we know that there is a responsibility to share by all of us the government has a role to play in terms of making sure that our children have places to live better safe and they that they have the food that they need that we make the mental health care available to them that the programming's there we also have to make sure that our parents have the tools that they need to support their young people and the community has responsibility parents have a responsibility the court system has responsibility after being arrested and made also to make sure that these children are held accountable to state attorneys everyone in the ecosystem has a role to play and so you say which part of it is is broken all over if you ask me and I think the act speaks for itself when we anytime we see these numbers increase in the way that they had and the sheer depravity of the cases I mentioned that one case of a person who lost his eyesight that depravity that I tell you I haven't seen and I've been system for a long time I started in 1997 at the process this is increasing in a way that is alarming and should be very alarming everyone has to step up and do that every day I don't think I can see it any better than what my county executive said I know you know that Brad you're asking things that you already know that I'm gonna say but this is what I would add to it that would be just a little bit different it is a true failure and I will system that we sit in circles like this but yet the accountability is here the accountability is only here when we get true accountability then our other partners that are in the system will be challenged for their actions would be challenged for their actions that means something because the police are challenged our leaders here challenge so who else gets challenged in this system and held accountable for the results that's all I can add to it I think that's it yeah question for the mayor and the chief the DC side of the people mind um you know chief potty you have spoke about changes that held people accountable can you be more specific to the laws that you see have changed that are no longer holding especially juveniles accountable and on the legal side what if anything can you do to address that and then my other question is on the dual task force we know that you have involved in working together the OIG's office has one addressing the same issue so what exactly is you so a couple of things thank you for your question so for the part about what change with the law it's not so much of what change with the law with the adults we know that there are things that are already in place there's no legislative change there but the the issue that I see is how is that a young person carjacks somebody today and in very short order prior to their trial and we know that you know with the COVID restrictions and so forth that could be a ways on that that young person is back out in community that is a problem and I think that there is an issue there that we really have to examine right whether the case is prosecuted not it so we've we've had those discussions right but a decision is made at some point what is going to happen with this young person I think that's kind of part of what the what the chief is talking about right I mean we lock them up and it goes to the next phase they say okay uh next phase what are we gonna what are we gonna do here we're gonna you know we're requesting that this person be held or decision is made at that point should this person be held or what should this status be and we have to have an examination of the entire system to really kind of get to the root of it in terms of the the second question that you answer yes we have you know collaborate I think the big takeaways here for much fall to police fun and Prince George County and the MPD sign the house we are expanding our carjacking task force we're embedding someone on the Prince George County side and we're also going to be doing our cross-border initiative while police officers are actually working together there's some things that we kind of got to work through whatever in terms of you know legally what that entails or what our limitations may be but that is a an important part of this because the kids are going back and forth across the lines and we cannot do what we do and be effective at what we do if that partnership does not exist and right now it's really not formalized it's more you know hey this officer over here knows this also over here in the county a car jacket happens a six D officer picks up the phone and calls an officer in the county kind of thing and we have to be more formal than that so the expansion of the task force is a big thing for the much-polyte police department because that has shown the work and then again like I said the cross-border initiative piece will embed in somebody with the poster of this guy hi I'm Casey with Doc News I have two quick questions for the Mayor the first being President Biden is going to New York City tomorrow to address guns we've seen a crime surge in cities across the nation is it a gun issue specifically is there something else going on and I can ask my second one after the answer I'm going to keep you for that sure so we've talked to quite a lot about a guns and the easy availability of guns guns crossing borders going up and down 95 going in and out of DC for Maryland and Virginia and the very easy access that our young people are are having to go with guns and the chief can tell you how many of these projects think that they're saying probably the majority of them involve a gun so we know and speaking of accountability we have a focus on dealing with all people who are using an illegal gun in a focus on making sure that the courts are getting those cases through and that people are being held accountable at the point where where they have a gun we have worked across the board with the ATF as well as the United States Attorney's offices and in neighboring Virginia counties to focus on limiting access to guns more quickly you said that there's no reason to point fingers and discussing the recalls as or who's to blame for this crime and hard jackings but the AG seems to as you went to Twitter over the weekend and said that you are indeed claiming the prosecution side what is your reaction to that I don't I'm not going to go back and forth with like politics because what we're doing right now is way more serious than that and somebody mentioned I think it was the chief mentioned that we all are held accountable by our bosses and my bosses are the people that district of Columbia and I've been to too many meetings where they're concerned about public safety as the county executive said the the fear and anxiety are here and our residents I haven't heard a little bit in some areas around around project in robbery attempts and so I know my job is to take to the people of the district of Columbia what we need we need our metropolitan police department to have all of the resources they need to deploy strategically and effectively where they can make a difference in communities that's important it's also our responsibility to provide services and we have so many programs and services I heard the list of the county executive listed a community group asked me the other day what can we do to help that doesn't involve the police help connect people and families that you know need help to programs and services that are out there to help them because we have a lot of those programs and services to help everybody we've also been very focused in the district on working with the superior court we actually we would like to provide services to justice involved young people that the courts are providing now we want that responsibility so we'll continue to work with the courts in an arrangement so that we are supervising young people that have been involved in crime and not the courts but it is also true that not every person not every young person should be in a diversion program I think what you heard in the chief chief's remarks is the idea that everybody should be out of the system and at home to rehabilitate well if the family cannot help their young person rehabilitate it is as a responsibility to make sure that young person is rehabilitating now we should also point out new beginnings no new beginnings is is our place where committed you are rehabilitated it is an opportunity if you ask me and this this message is not for you as far as judges it is an opportunity for a young person to get on the right track to get school to get counseling and to be out of an environment where they might kill or be killed that's an opportunity any other questions yes good morning I'm James Wright with the Washington Informa newspaper I have a question for either executive also books or chief of zis okay in Prince George's County you have municipalities these municipalities have police departments what role if any are they going to play in terms of this card jacking effort well let me say we were really closely with our municipality chiefs and we have been for many years a decade what we're doing now is strengthening our information exchange we have many police officers in those municipalities who can help us with these things but what I was told as far as about three weeks ago in our last meeting is that they needed more information and better statistics in order to help them we've already addressed that by giving information in almost real time two goes municipalities but we haven't strengthened the bonds in many years and we're working to strengthen in those bonds without municipalities they play a very vital role and without those police chiefs and their leadership in action Prince George's County and our police department and our county would not be as successful as we have been just tell James that was a good question because there are a lot of resources that can be brought to bear on on this problem I know that the chief calls on federal resources as well including the ATF DA they made a recent very important arrest involving you know people died because of this bad road some of the streets so well they're all bad but they don't okay Mark yeah I hear you guys saying particularly on the DC side you know about diversion not working in all these juveniles you seem to be saying that they're re-offending and that's what I want to know do you have data can you show us that these kids who are arrested once put in a diversion program not sent to new beginnings or someplace like that sent back into the community are then re-offending because we hear you kind of implying that at least I am through that from what I'm hearing but is there any data that actually supports that yes let me correct you on one thing I didn't say diversion doesn't work diversion can work is just not appropriate for every situation and there has to be appropriate supports in that diversion so we have very successful programs that we have supported in our department of human services and there have been there's also supervision of young people who have already been committed on the court side so diversion can work supervision certainly should be working and we need to make sure that all of the supports are there but it's also not appropriate for for every case in Mark you do know that we're limited in what we can say about useful offenders the chief may be able to say something and some you know I just want to add one thing and you know what this is just a blunt answer well the truth of the matter is we're not here to celebrate how successful we have been in these programs because if we were successful we wouldn't be here talking about it we're talking about 300 in Prince George's in 193 par jackings primarily committed by children and so we know that we have programming we know that some of the programming works but the truth of blunt truth is if it was working as well as it should have we could be here having this press conference and so we have to do we know that the children that the juvenile system well aim is to rehabilitate children they are not being rehabilitated because they're out in our community farming our residents terrorizing them traumatizing them and they have been traumatized themselves and so whatever we're doing the point of this is that it is not working nearly well enough and as the mayor said I'm hearing from our residents as well they don't feel safe and these crimes are no longer being committed just in gas stations and a convenience store these children are in people's driveway farming them and so it's just at a point where it is it is not working and that's why they're ringing this bell today and saying that whatever it is we're doing clearly it's not working nearly well enough or it's not working well enough for us and we have to do different and do better and everyone has to do better all right let's take a few moments and we'll take a look at it in the comments you know how many more of you know how many of the programs we've seen for that numbers how many juvenile suit prosecuted 70% of the 100 that you were arrested I've asked his office they've not been able to give me the data how many of those rest ended up in diversions you know how many end up in diversion and how many reoffend yeah I'm not sure the number that actually ended up in diversion mark but I'm sure he will be able to provide that to you I'll tell you what my gut tells me I'll tell you what my gut tells me as I look at the bailing as I talk to chief is decent compared names in the law enforcement service their children let's just say let's just say have none of them reoffended if none of them reoffend the fact that between and press drulges county and DC we have over 200 young people that committed a car jacket is staggering to me and it should be to everybody there are instances where there have been young people as we look back over the case look back over the last couple of years some of them have been repeat offenders in terms of what that exact number is maybe we can share that that information specifically a little later but the other thing that we're seeing when I look at for example and this is what we've talked about this yesterday I'm looking for example in DC here's one of my kids that committed a car jacking in DC and that same kid get arrested by chief of z folks over in press drulges county are you able to go in the court and press drulges county and talk about what happened in the district of comahmoud when we arrested the kid the car jacking if he didn't car jacking in the press drulges county and that's a problem right that's that that in itself is a problem beyond beyond that just not whatever happens on the judicial side of things that's not my lane so I'm trying to kind of steer clear that but with respect to the young people that we are arresting the other piece of this which makes this a little murky to kind of talk about it some of the young people mark that we arrested that we arrest the second go around we haven't even talked about the ones that get arrested for the stolen autos you know why they get charged with stolen autos let's talk truth for a minute right and you look at those numbers why they get arrested for stolen autos and not car jacking because if they car jack somebody they got a gun in somebody's face in the mask form the victim cannot identify them so when we do catch them we can't charge them with car jacking but we will charge them with the stolen car so when I look across the county borders okay how many my kids have been arrested over in Prince George's county but still in the stolen car those numbers I think I want to say it's up somewhere around like 38% of kids right but I mean it is a problem and people are trying to focus in on the one-odd so this and that the bottom land problem 200 kids between DC and Prince George's county arrested for car jacking should be alarming to everybody whether they repeat a fender or not repeat repeat offenders that is a glaring problem but the fact that they did it one time the fact of the 13 or 14 year old one time thought it was okay to put a gun in somebody's face and take their car we have to look at what we're doing here and as the county executive the mayor and the chief and all said it's a holistic look at the system mark what is everybody doing and are we doing this is best we can in that space let me add someone that's because I think I want to add that because he asked question and the answer is yes we can we can show you statistic after statistic of juveniles who have been arrested multiple kind of time 10 11 12 times so much that we put that into some kind of matrix where we can understand the juveniles who keep re-offending without consequence so yes we can show you that so again Alex bound then when are we going to enjoy the rest of the system to say what are you doing at what point are you going to be held accountable at what point would that juvenile reach out to us because we've been doing so much reaching and at one point will we say enough is enough we don't need to further victimizing people in our residents and our cities and our county my name is manzla oh thank you I'm a community member from up in capital view so I'm acutely aware of this cardiac and problem having witnessed too in my own neighborhood but I'm here to talk about a connected issue here we are on Marvin Gaye trail and if you look around or you follow it down to the end you will see that we have a playground that is completely falling apart but also a playground where there was a murder and maybe the middle of June July right there in front of it so we have both a failure of our young kids for the most basic things safe places to play and a failure to get the youth in our community connected to the services so that they can not engage in criminal activity right there where our children want to play so what I wanted to add is you know what can we look forward to from your office as far as addressing of course the playground itself but also disarming community well we are very engaged in this community I think you know in when I just wrote has a lot of the investments we've made right here at Strand what we've made in our public housing I will take a look at the park have some DGS officials here and we'll we'll work on that but if you're asking me about who killed somebody in that park I wanted the police to address that because we again if somebody died there we should want to make sure that that victim has justice and that we're cleaning up everything in the community but thank you for that question we'll simply think the second question was here and then you yes yeah and Katie met Lauren with the Washington Post I'm just wondering if maybe both of you can address what work is being done currently to work with the state's attorney's office those prosecutors and most jurisdictions to sort of mitigate this or address what the chief just said about which is the juveniles are being arrested over and over and over again and we have a regular coordination with our criminal justice partners called the CJCC the prime justice coordinating council where not only members of my administration on the executive side including the attorney general for the district who's responsible for use prosecution but also federal partners and our courts which are also our federal partners so we are doing some ongoing on going talks about how to make sure all parts of our ecosystem are working better we've also added some work to that in the deputy mayor for public safety is here with an initiative that's focused on people of all ages who we think need more intent services through our building blocks initiative and as they get those intent services we hope that we prevent them or stop them from engaging in crime as I was standing here I mentioned to the chief like even our regional coordination which is also these folks or us and we're talking all of the time but I think following some numbers and providing some public feedback and what we're doing together we'll work on a way to do that so someone to the mayor we're working with our state attorney's office we have a criminal coordinating committee we also have regular requirements that involve the state attorney so we've been in communication with the state attorney and the state attorney's office our state attorney did form also the card jacking task force in the government is participated also in that card jacking task force and so we're all in regular communication and we'll continue to do so judge tell us and Adams has convened a group we were able to meet last week we're going to include the state attorney also in that group or we meet not only with the police department the courts this sheriff's office and everyone will be continuing to sit at the table and to come up to with solutions on these issues but these are real serious issues and again everyone has a role to play and they're going to all just hold each other accountable to play our serious roles thank you all extra thank you Jenny Gaffer with the main news news news one of the clearly raised me by advocate and also my dear commencement this upcoming election has been that your administration hasn't really seriously invested in non-police methods of that interaction we haven't been sort of included given a few of the two long-to-company so planning around this stuff and the state's position with violent contractors and credible method there's haven't been adequately professionalized given the resources to really you know be part of this work and I'm curious what your response is to that with regards to both the position of project and also just violence for brother well um I don't know what you call a 58 million dollar investment in one year I don't know what you call doubling on the office of neighborhood safety and engagement in a time that it's been in place to think five years now to today on doubling its resources and professionals and creating an entire government agency but what I call it is a real investment in techniques that we are hopeful will work over time even the main proponents of these techniques say that it takes time well we've been willing to put the district tax payers dollars into that hope and what that means is that we're hiring people that go across neighborhoods that we have identified as most serious crime we've created a structure for intense services for individuals who have identified as being most likely to commit crime and be victims of crime and we put all of those resources out into the streets including working with our nonprofit partners with providing grants and services all right thank you everybody",

The psalmist said it so well. This is the day that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it. I am truly amazed by the tremendous favor God has bestowed upon our beloved county and as council chair, I am deeply humbled to stand before you on behalf of our new county council. Being chosen to lead and serve this great county is a signal honor and we are all very proud and excited to celebrate our progress, this inaugural ceremony and our next four years together. To our wonderful citizens, elected leadership past, family members, honor guests, neighbors and friends, thank you so much for being here today. Your presence and support on this joyful day means the world to all of us. None of us could do this job well without the love and support of our families and we want them to know we are forever grateful. Our patients and understanding allows us as elected officials to focus on a life of public service. If I may take a moment of personal privilege, I want to thank my parents, my husband Steve, our children Lillian and Evan who motivate me to be better every single day and are always available for hugs after a long one. Our thanks also to the inaugural 2018 planning committee for this outstanding event. You have worked long and hard. You have worked long and hard during this leadership transition to make today a success. Your tireless efforts are very, very much appreciated. We are also deeply grateful to our departing council colleagues who have served their second and final terms under term limits. The Honorable Andrea C. Harrison. Mary Laman. Obey Patterson. And Karen R. Tolls. As well as our alcoining county executive, Richard Elbaker III. Together we worked over the last eight years to further the transformation of Prince George's County into an economic powerhouse in our region, breaking ground on major new projects across this county, including a new hospital, and celebrating a multitude of grand openings. Our collective leadership has given rise to a much stronger, safer and more robust Prince George's County. The legacy of our predecessors and countless other public servants has laid the foundation we are blessed to build upon today. Their invaluable contributions and commitment to this county we all call home is a beacon for all who are elected leaders in this great and awesome county. The 2018 election saw a historic number of women and people of color run for and win elected offices. And very shortly on this stage we will bear witness to our own historical first in Prince George's County as county executive elect. And also, it will become the first woman to hold the seat of office. The council congratulates our county executive elect for successfully shattering the glass ceiling that others have been chiseling for such a long time. Together in leadership we will propel our county forward to deliver the very best for all of our residents. This is truly a moment of profound change in county government, a moment which gives us the opportunity to take a deeper look at how we govern, how we empower and engage our residents and how we deliver for our communities. With a new and expanded council, we have a fresh and energetic team of lawmakers united by a positive vision for the county and her people and focus on the critical issues facing our county. We are eager as council members to make a difference in the lives of Prince Georgeians through our leadership and service. Together we are bound to the unfolding story of Prince George's County. Having taken this oath and uphold the county charter, this council is committed to placing the best interests of our county first. Our success, our success as a county will be measured by our ability to consider all viewpoints and balance all perspectives for doing a relationship that serves our county well. As these are Shava said, we cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community. Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others for their sakes and for our own. Four of us are returning to council to serve our second terms. Myself and council vice chair Todd Turner, council member Derek Leon Davis and council member Denny Tveris. Most of our expanded 11 member local legislature however, our new faces on the council or familiar faces now in new places. We welcome council members Tom Dernogga, Jolene Ivy, Monique Anderson Walker and Sydney Harrison as well as our two new voter approved at large members, council members Mel Franklin and Calvin S Hawkins the second. As the baton is passed and we run the next leg of our legislative agenda, this council will continue to build on legacy initiatives that transcend transition, housing opportunities for all, transformative economic development. We have created zoning regulations, a world class education for our young people, access to quality health care, refuge for those in need, regional cooperation and a balanced budget that speaks to our shared priorities. During the term this new council, we will see major projects move forward to completion and new places grow over the next four years. The new hospital, University of Maryland, capital region health, anchoring downtown, print shortages at Larger Town Center, will open its doors and transform healthcare delivery in our county and our local economy. Sutland, Sutland will be at the center of a Renaissance anchor by development that was envisioned over 20 years ago when the honorable Wayne Kay Curry led our county and we will take our first rides on the new 16 mile purple line light rail. Working together we will build a print shortages county where lives and communities are transformed and economic progress is achieved. Print shortages county is a competitive force across our region and our nation and the energy of this new 11 member county council and our new county executive in stores the best is yet to come. This new council looks forward to working with every stakeholder, civic leaders, religious leaders, businesses, nonprofits and neighborhood groups to identify the most effective ways to extend our partnership for the greatest mutual benefit of all. We also understand that for print shortages county to succeed our citizens must be confident that their voices are heard and that we are making the best decisions for the good of our residents and our communities. Over the next four years as part of our mission we will employ initiatives to address the concerns of print shortages enhance our quality of life and yes together strengthen our communities. Working together for an even better print shortages county will mean growing communities that we are anchored to strive to care for, feel proud of, celebrating a county where children and their families can live the filled lives and pursue their dreams and creating a place that our young people seniors and veterans can continue to call home. The tabestry that is print shortages county is full of astonishing beauty with riches that stretch from acochie to laurel and everywhere in between. Our rural areas are beautiful treasures, our metro stations are just beginning to emerge with activity and there is abundance and opportunity waiting to be discovered and cultivated across this county from all our outstanding assets including the state university, print shortages community college, the University of Maryland College Park and joint base andreuse. Our tabestry is also woven with a diversity that is hard to find in any other county in this region and the core of our strength, the core of our strength that we as us together is made up the people of this vibrant county. It is all of you, it is us. Our creativity, passion and fearlessness sets us apart. We are living in critical times in our nation, fragmented by acts of hate and violence, a lack of civility and too often divided by racism, discrimination and intolerance. And Georgians know there is no hope in the embrace of deep divisions. The same diversity we treacher as our strength in print shortages county, some inexplicably see as a threat. In our community we know it is our collective experiences and perspectives, share through many lenses that allow us to seek clearly and continue to progress.

Every church, Tarell and African-American activist champion, we must lift as we climb. There is no challenge before us that we cannot solve when we act as the community and make use of all of our talents. There cannot be any hidden figures if we are to capture the abundance and opportunity that is print shortages. Imagine what can happen if we harness all of our talents for the veteran service of all. Imagine what this county can be as we unite, magnify and create more possibilities with each moment that we act as one county. Successfully shaping our county story and meeting our challenges from this day forward involves all of us. Improving our quality of life and continuing to embrace and expand the progress in print shortages will take all of us.

Only together as one county can our tabstry, our story and our county shine bright with grateful hearts, the members of this council, humbly thank print shortage for your trust and confidence and for the privilege to serve. Lifted by the momentum of this day, you can count on the energy, commitment and collective abilities of this council to work for you. May God bless you and God bless print shortages county. We thank council chair glero for that inspiring message on behalf of the entire council. Now to bring us a prayer of inspiration, Imam Talib M. Sharif of the nation's Lask of Washington DC will join us on stage. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. And that it was with Almighty God's name, the merciful been in fact to the merciful Redeemer. Let us pray. Almighty God, the merciful, the wise, the most high possessor of greatness, the giver of all that is good as your bounty exceeds our ability to measure and your blessings exceed our ability to count. We humbly besiege your divine providence upon this historic inauguration, upon this county and its council, with leaders determined to make significant advancements in bettering the circumstances affecting the present and future of this county. Investing in the people, helping the least and as we are seeing with this body, for any time you invest in the people, you help lift them up to the point where they discover the best in themselves, their potential, their own worth, and self-equentely become not only a healthy power for resource to themselves but also to this great county. Grant this body clear vision and legislative acumen as they navigate the waters of our county issues. Grant them insight, wisdom and logic and bless them to follow the logic to its logical conclusion. Grant them the quality of excellence in planning both short and long term that focuses on the right thing, the right way at the right time, with always the right disposition of always wanting the best for the space that we inevitably share with others and bless them to have always the right perception of our county. At first of all, this county is a gift from you and under you all, my God, we are responsible for how we treat everything. And as we heard in our pledge, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all, in acknowledging you all, my God, who created us all and cares about us all equally. Bless this leadership, bless this council to continue to be mindful and reflective of e-ploribus owner. Out of many one, one nation, one humanity, one county, one common origin, dating back to Adam, and we are all children of Adam and from him, as we see represented in this county, the many wonderful, beautiful, diverse expressions of human life that have contributed to the beauty and strength of this county and to America. And may we find inspiration in our declaration that many are here supporting this national point, which declares, we hold these truths to be self-evident that all, no matter their status, ethnicity, sex, race or religion, are created, not accidents, created, equal, justice, recognize and sameness for all. And in doubt by their creator, recognizing you all, my God, the creator, with certain and alibi rights that can't be taken away from them, and alibi rights. Among these, life, the right to live, all life is sacred, liberty, the right to be free to progress and their pursuit of happiness. We thank you all, my God, for blessing us with a constitution that does not base itself upon the identity or classification of a race, religion or nationality. Rather, it bases itself upon the life needs and aspirations of the universal person, the common type that is in every one of us the same with no difference. And lastly, all my God, you made all of us one human type. There are no two types of human. We all born, all babies of born human first. We have human organs and body parts that can be shared regardless of sex, race, ethnicity. Likewise there are no two types of human souls. Our souls, our common souls, they are not black, they are not white, they are not yellow, etc. But colorless, our souls that are not ethnic or not national but human. Maybe one for our brothers sister, what we want for ourselves, maybe we build each other up and not tear each other down, maybe not shun each other. We want another, or maybe one another. Rather, maybe we be brothers and sisters, we want another. And understand that it takes two sides to build a bridge. May our work of building reach both sides in the spirit of universal kinship and bringing communities and accounting together upon the inherent goodness of their human soul and the common value shared by so many and those members of this council and leadership. Amen. Thank you, Imam. The time has come. It is now my honor to introduce Angela also Brooks, Prince George's County Executive Elect. She is a proud and lifelong Prince George who was raised in Camp Springs, Maryland and now resides in Upper Marborough with her beautiful daughter, Alex. Angela began her rapid career path which spans over two decades as a public servant and leader in Prince George's County government over 20 years ago. Notably, her career is thematic and has indeed come full circle. Beginning in 1997 as a Prince George's County assistant states attorney. Five years later, in 2002, she was appointed by the County Executive to serve as Education Liaison. Subsequently, in 2003, she was appointed as the Executive Director of the County Revenue Authority. In 2010, she took a leap of faith and launched her career as an elected official by overcoming a 2% name recognition against a field of candidates who had all run for public office previously and guess what? You got it. Angela, by an overwhelming margin, was elected to serve as the County State's Attorney, becoming the youngest and first woman to be elected to the office in Prince George's County. A hallmark of Angela's approach as state's attorney was to engage the community to prevent further crime. Also Brooks and her office have been a major factor in the record crime reduction of the County that is seen over the last four years and the 50% reduction in violent crime over the last seven years. In November 2018, Angela was once again overwhelmingly elected as the eighth County Executive for Prince George's County as well as the first woman to hold that position. Through her unifying and inclusive leadership style, Angela will ensure that everyone has a seat at the table and voice in decisions that impact their lives. I'd like to invite now the Honourable Sheila Tillerson Adams, administrative judge of the Prince George's County Circuit Court and the seventh judicial court to the podium. She will now administer the oath of office to County Executive elect Angela also Brooks. And again, the time has finally arrived. County Executive, take your place. I, Angela also broke, do solemnly swear, do solemnly swear that I will support the constitution of the United States, that I will support the constitution of the United States and that I will be faithful and that I will be faithful and their true allegiance and their true allegiance to the state of Maryland and support the constitution and laws thereof. And support the constitution and laws thereof. And that I will support the charter and that I will support the charter and laws of Prince George's County and laws of Prince George's County and that I will and that I will to the best of my skill and judgment to the best of my skill and judgment diligently and faithfully, diligently and faithfully without partiality or prejudice, without partiality or prejudice. Execute the office of County Executive for Prince George's County Maryland. Execute the office of County Executive for Prince George's County Maryland. Supporting to the constitution and laws of this state, according to the constitution and laws of this state and the charter and laws of Prince George's County and the charter and laws of Prince George's County. Thank you. O Tastes and See that the Lord is good. Blessed is the man that trusted in him. I have to begin this morning by saying thank you so much to God for the opportunity to stand before you today. It is only by God's grace and mercy that we are able to do all things. I would also like to thank my mother Patricia and my father James for being the biggest supporters of me and my sister and for pushing us to always be our best selves. I would also like to thank my daughter Alexandra the amazing for all of her love and support and patience. She has willingly shared me with all of you all since she was just five years old. There were mornings I had to leave twerly, nights I got home too late to tuck her in and weekends where she spent the afternoon with me listening to victims of crime or concerned citizens about issues that she was too young to even understand. This election cycle my Alex showed maturity beyond belief. Even in all of its difficulty as her peers and sadly sometimes as adults and things to her there were unkind during my campaign. Like a true champion she kept her head up brought on straight a's and in her own words smoked a few competitors on that track. I would also like to thank my secret weapon the best big sister anyone could ever ask for. Kimberly also Brooks see more. My sister is a fierce lady and she is fought for me my entire life. While Kim was a student at Virginia Tech I was also a student at Duke University and a young woman that I knew had gone into my dorm room while I was gone took out an outfit and guess what later that night I saw her at a party wearing my clothes. Well during a phone conversation made the mistake of mentioning that to Kim and apparently I didn't get the clothes back quickly enough because before I knew it Kim had rented one of those itty bitty economy cars from budget rental. She drove from Blacksburg to Durham showed up on my doorstep and said where is the girl with the clothes. Not only has Kim been my treasure for each of my campaigns but she has been my very best friend. Thank you so much Kim. I also want to thank all of my extended family and all of my friends who have traveled from near and far to be here with me today. They've come from New York to Texas from Bermuda to Switzerland and I'm just so honored and grateful that you have taken the time and made the effort to be here with me today. As I stand here today as your new county executive. I want to thank county executive Rashurn Baker for all that you have accomplished over the last eight years. We were in a much different place during his first inauguration but he has led us with dignity and character and he has been a great friend and Rashurn I'd like to say thank you from the very bottom of my heart. Thank you. I would also like to thank all of our outgoing county council members for the work that you have done over the last eight years. You have played a major role in our successes. I want to thank you so much for the friendship that you have extended to me and state's attorney and wish you well in all of your future endeavors. I would also like to acknowledge my friends and colleagues who are on the stage with me our new county council. And I'd like to congratulate each of you and let you know that I'm ready to get to work and I know that you are too. And while we acknowledge that there is still much work to be done, I want to let all of you in on an open secret. And that is that Prince George's County is the crown jewel of Maryland. Now that may not have been a surprise to many of us in this room but right now I'm here with all of you to make sure that the state, the region, the country and the world know who we are and what we are. Because Prince George's County isn't on the brink. Prince George's County isn't around the corner. Prince George's County isn't all most there. Ladies and gentlemen, Prince George's County has arrived. But today we stepped out of the shadows and claim our past, our present and our future. Today we begin fulfilling the promise of Prince George's County together. I think Prince George's have been laboring so hard and so single-mindedly over these past several years that we haven't realized just how successful we've become. We've achieved record crime reductions with a 40% reduction in violent crime over the last eight years and 50% overall reduction in crime. This is the lowest crime rate we have recorded in at least five decades. Prince George's we have never been safer than we are today. We are building a new $600 million state-of-the-art capital region medical center that will be the hub of our expanded primary and preventive care health options for our citizens. We fought hard and secured legislation that will contribute to the funding we need to provide a quality education for our children. As a result of our laser focus over the last eight years, we are finally beginning to turn the tables and the fight against domestic violence, providing more resources than ever before, helping to reduce the stigma of reporting and encouraging more faith-based and community engagement on this issue. And I want you to know how proud I am that we have achieved a 20% reduction in domestic homicides this year. This is amazing. It hasn't been easy, but it's been a true partnership between the government, faith community and citizens and it proves the power of our collective strength. And after many years, others now know what we've known all along. Prince George's County is a great place to invest. We now have billions of dollars worth of investment, economic development projects coming down the pipeline. We are the economic engine of this state and this truly is the place to be. Prince George's County is looking the mirror. We are a success. At the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Senator Cory Booker said, hours is an even greater nation, not because we started perfect, but because every generation has successfully labored to make us a more perfect union. And it is high time to properly acknowledge those who did the laboring to make our county more perfect. Like Gladys' new spellman, it's time to acknowledge the work of Floyd Wilson, Deborah Marshall, Carlton Sickles and Dorothy Bailey. Let's acknowledge Royal Heart, Joanne Bell and my good friend Howard Stone. Let's pay our respect to all of the other servants that came before us, that labored before us to make Prince George's County perfect and to fulfill our promise. My parents are a part of that generation that labored. And if you'll indulge me, I'd like to tell you a quick story about my dad, MacAlsyn Brooks. When I was a kid, I used to love to ride along with my dad as he worked his midnight shift loading and unloading his delivery truck as a distributor for the Washington Post. My sister and I would be so excited to go to work with my dad for his one and two AM shift that we'd often sleep in our clothes overnight. Here was my dad who I have to tell you, he's never been a stout man. With these 25 pound and 55 pound stacks of newspaper on each shoulder, climbing in and out of a truck all night long, ink and dust covering his skin and his hair. One night my dad said to my sister and I, you know what, I jump up and down on this dirty truck so you will never have to. My dad did that back breaking work because he wanted to make sure that we had the opportunity to go to college without worrying about how to pay for it. While I was in college, my dad's contract wasn't renewed and so he lost that job. It had a devastating financial impact on our family but he never complained and he was never deterred. He went and got a job at Pohanka Motor Cars and sold cars to pay our tuition. And he was salesman of the year every single year. Thank you dad for jumping up and down on that truck and walking up and down that car lot so that Kim and I could realize our dreams. To my mom Patricia, thank you for the example that you said for making me proud to be a woman, a servant and a fighter. You labor for decades as a receptionist and a phenomenal mother, making sure that Kim and I understood the importance of a good education and that we understood that there is dignity in all work. We found out that my mother had breast cancer nine years ago and despite undergoing chemotherapy, she made sure she never missed a beat at work. She walked six blocks each way and the July sun with a wig on from the parking lot to her office occasionally sitting on the school steps to catch her breath. I was so upset about this and I said, you know, let me call please to your office to see if we can get you closer parking accommodations and she said to me, no, you know what, I'm so grateful to have a job with insurance benefits so that I can get the treatment that I need. And she went on to say, you know, Angie, there's a reason that God wants me to make that walk and so I'll make it. Thank you, mom. My parents, like so many of our families, sacrificed and labored to allow their children to realize their dreams and hopes and to build the Prince George's County that we all enjoy, but they're not alone. Thank you to some of my favorite people and you all know who you are, our seniors from all across Prince George's County who have supported me and even lined dance with me and sacrificed and labored to make Prince George's County even greater than it's ever been. To the veterans of Prince George's County who comprised the largest population of veterans in the state of Maryland. Thank you for fighting for the freedoms that we enjoyed because of the sacrifices that you have made. The labors of all of our citizens from every walk of life, every race, creed, color, religion, and socioeconomic background from Eagle Harbor to Soutland, from seat Pleasant to Laurel have made Prince George's County into the crown jewel of Maryland. My promise to them and to you and to the next generation is that we will preserve that inheritance, grow it and hand it off to the next generation. Prince George's County, it's time for us to labor. Growing up in Prince George's, I didn't always appreciate the rich history that our four parents established and I certainly didn't learn that Prince George's modern history dates back four centuries. It was in 1609 that British captain John Smith, the Chesapeake Bay's first explorer, wrote the following about Prince George's. Heaven and Earth never agreed better to frame a place for man's habitation, a fruitful and the lightsome land. This land which would become one of the original 13 colonies fueled an agricultural economy and a way of life that would one day lead to our nation's liberty. Prince George's land was so abundant and fruitful in fact that in 1791 we seeded a portion of it to form the district of Columbia and about that same time and for many decades prior the ancestors of many of us in this room were enslaved field hands. In fact slaves represented more than half the population of the county but even in those dark and oppressive times the spirit of Prince George's prevailed. Our county was a key waste station on the Underground Railroad in 1862 we won emancipation and set out to labor and to create for ourselves a county that would embrace humanity and dignity in all of its glorious colors. In 1941 John Green established the Columbia Air Center, the first black owned air point in the county on a field near Crune. In 1959 just a year after being established NASA opened its first flight center right here in Greenbelt Maryland. We're home to the state's flagship public university, the University of Maryland College Park and the state's oldest historically black college, Buys State University. And we are proud to have helped raise Prince George's like Kevin Durant, Congressman Stinney Hoyer, former county executive Wayne Curry and actress Tarraji P. Henson. Now maybe I didn't appreciate that history and that legacy because like so many of us we focused on the negative. We focused on how others perceived us and that affected us. We lost our connection with our past, with our promise and with the gift that we had been given. We lost our sense of pride. We didn't talk about where we'd been, how we'd struggle to get there and where we were going. We didn't talk about how our ancestors broke free of bondage and came to thrive. We didn't talk about the greatness of Prince George's or our institutions. Instead we talked about where we were, how we were almost there, that our destiny was just around the corner that we were on the brink, somewhere along the way. We lost track of who we are, how valuable we are, how capable we are, how strong we are. But I am so proud to declare today that we don't need to compare ourselves to anyone. We are a model for others to follow. And every day of the week we loaned this region our workforce, our intellect and our labor. We are a strong part of the economic engine that drives our region. And for those who may not know, Prince George's County is in the top 3% wealthiest counties in the United States of America. We are the driving force in Maryland. The mayor Bowser, I love you like a sister. And I'm grateful for your friendship and proud of your vision and your leadership and proud of your devotion to all eight wards. We are sisters raised here to be recklessly proud of our hometown. So I know you won't mind me saying it, but Prince George's write this down. We are not ward 9. Prince George's is time that we stand up with our back straight with our chest out in our heads held high. Stand up and be proud of who we are and where we've been. We can stand no matter what adversity we've faced. Because when we stand on the shoulders of greatness, we'll be amazed by the sights we'll see in the heights we will reach. And we will see how far and how high we can go together. In that same speech of the Democratic National Convention, Cory Booker said, Senator Cory Booker said, our respect and value, the ideals of rugged individualism and self-reliance. But rugged individualism didn't defeat the British. It didn't get us to the moon, build our nation's highways, or map the human genome. We did that together. The only way that Prince George's county is going to fulfill its promise is if we do it together. The high calling of public service will require us to focus on the needs of people, all people, and to resist the temptation to act out of rugged individualism and the desire for political game or personal game. We must make bold, tough, and sometimes unpopular decisions that will not ask the question, what will it profit me today, but what can we build for our children's tomorrow? We are the promise keepers, and we've never set aside the wisdom of our seniors. We must cultivate and develop the spirit of service in our youth, and we will need the courage and determination of all of those in between to accomplish this. Prince George's roll up your sleeves. There are certain promises that I've made to you, and if you're labor with me, I know we can keep those promises together. Because when we labor, our focus on education will return where it belongs to students, teachers, and their parents. And we will create a pathway for every child to succeed without respect for their zip code, and they will get head start toward building universal pre-K for every child in Prince George's County. When we labor, you will feel the power of your tax dollars, and we will deliver to you a government that is responsible, transparent, and accountable. Letter will be removed, mediums will be clean, and code enforcement will be a priority. When we labor, our economic development plan will focus on revitalizing established communities and ridding the county of the food deserts that have negatively impacted some of our most prized neighborhoods and the people who call them home. And we will ensure that revitalization doesn't push people out of their homes, and that our seniors can age and place gracefully. When we labor, we will have a renewed focus not only on economic development, but also human development. And we will address issues we face with mental illness and addictions. When we labor, we will invest in transportation projects that help you get around our county and not just out of our county. So will you stand with me, Prince George's? Will you labor with me, Prince George's? Will you help me keep these promises, Prince George's? That's what you all were in this together. We're in this together. And the only way that we will build the county we envision is if we do it together. I'm pleased to say that I have amazing partners to do this. I have great colleagues on the Prince George's county council who are sitting on the stage behind me. This is a day of significance for each of us. And I can't wait to work with you to answer the call of service, honestly, proudly. And with the knowledge that we are toiling in the fruitful ground, tilled by our ancestors in order to produce something fruitful for our children. At the end of the day, we're all on the same team. Team Prince George's. Team Prince George's? I've got your back. Mel Franklin and Calvin Hawkins are new at large council members. I've got your back. Tom Dernoga, Denis Tavadas, Danielle Glarros, Todd Turner, Joline Ivy, Derek Davis, Rodney Streeter, Monique Anderson Walker, and Sydney Harrison. I've got your back. And even though he couldn't be here today, I want to thank Governor Hogan for assuring me that his administration will support Prince George's county. And I want to acknowledge all of the members of our federal and state delegations and the members of our Board of Education and thank them for their continued service and commitment to our county. Together, we will fulfill the promises of Prince George's. I want to end this address the way that I begin and end each day. And that is by giving thanks to the God who made it possible. Today is a day that I have worked for and dreamed about for a long time. And my solemn promise to each of you that every day when I wake up and every night when I go to sleep, I'll carry the hopes and dreams of your family with me. They will guide my actions and my administration will work hard together to ensure that we fulfill the obligation that comes with the awesome responsibility that you have given me. And it will be my greatest desire that every child growing up in my hometown will have the same chance to experience every opportunity that I've had. What a great day to be a Prince George. Prince George's county, thank you for placing your confidence in me. I will not let you down. May God continue to bless each of you and may God bless Prince George's community. Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, my honor to present now the Prince George's county executive, the honorable Angela, also Brooks, the leader of the executive branch of the county government. Thank you for that riveting speech, especially the personal stories, the family stories that tell us a lot about how she became the woman and public servant here with us today. Thank you for sharing those and thank you to your family as well. Now please join me in welcoming Rabbi Saul Oreski of the Mishkan Torah synagogue who will now deliver an inspirational prayer. Dear friends, there is a Hebrew blessing that is appropriate for this occasion. Although it comes from Jewish liturgy, it is universal. And I offer it today an honor of our new wonderful county executive, Angela, also Brooks. And our county council and all others who are serving our county. Baruch Atah Arunai, Elohenu Melef Olam, Asher Kijano Bmitz Votav, Vizivanu, La Asok, Bitsorhe Zibur. Blessed are you, Arunai Arunai, ruler of the universe who has sanctified us through your commandments and commanded us to occupy ourselves with the needs of the community. Today is also quite auspiciously the first day of Hanukkah. Last night we lit the first candle with the Shammosh, the helper candle. Tonight we will light two and so on until the eighth night we will use the Shammosh to light eight candles. This teaches us two important lessons. The first is that we dispel darkness by spreading light. And just as the Shammosh, the helper candle lights the others, we ignite and fuel each other's work with our care and our passion. The second lesson is that we increase light. We don't lessen it. It is our obligation to uplift the good that others do by adding our light to theirs. And not waste our precious time and energy merely tearing down what others have done. Hanukkah means dedication, referring to the dedication of the temple in Jerusalem by the Macbes after they had taken it back from the defeated Assyrian Greeks. It was a victory of the few over the many. For all of us, however, today is a day of rededication. As those sworn in this morning dedicate themselves to the difficult job of serving the needs of the citizens of our county. Though we are also few and the challenges presented are many, we too can and will meet and overcome them. Let us unite today with hope and pledge to cooperate with each other in this holy work, drawing on the sparts of God within each of us to together a kindle one awesome light that will be a beacon towards greater freedom and opportunity for all. Thank you and may God bless you today and always. Thank you to Rabbi Arreski and now we'll have another musical selection from the Oxenhill High School Choir. We thank you for sharing your beautiful voices with us this morning. Hard to follow that. Today we gather to witness the administration of the oath of office for some extraordinary leaders. This has been an invigorating morning that will lead to many new and historic chapters of progress in Prince George's County history. The people have spoken. Their leaders are in place, great expectations have been placed in each of you and in each of you, the people of Prince George's County. Great leaders, great leaders, they are ready to serve through good, bad and in different times as one county, one team to fulfill the promise of Prince George's County. On behalf of the 2018 inaugural planning committee, thank you to each program participant, volunteers, county employees, Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission, vendors, citizens, residents and to each of you here today for being a part of this memorable occasion in the county's history. I want to especially thank Prince George's County Executive Angela also Brooke and the Prince George's County Council for the opportunity today that I've had of being your MC, a chore that I've immensely enjoyed. May God bless America, may God bless Prince George's County and each of you gathered here today. To close, please join me in welcoming Pastor John K. Jenkins, a first Baptist Church of Glen Arden back to the podium to deliver the benediction. Shall we stand? Now unto the God who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think according to the power that works in us, to him be glory and majesty, domain and power both now and forever more. And let us all say amen. We'd ask that the media please clear the center aisle at this time. Again, media please clear the center aisle. Ladies and gentlemen, kindly remain seated until a host or host us guide you to a seating row at the reception. As a reminder to the seniors on the arena floor, your shuttles will promptly depart from the north tunnel at 12.30 pm. Again, that's the north tunnel at 12.30 pm. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. Oh, and if Miss Ronan is still on the stage, we would like to present her with a small token of our appreciation. On behalf of Prince George's County Executive, Angela also brookes administration. Thank you very much.",

        "transcript": " you . Good morning everybody. I want to thank you for joining us today. I'm John Erzen. I'm the deputy chief of staff for the county executive. And today you will hear from county executive also Brooks and our chief health officer, Dr. Ernest Carter, as they provide an update into the county's continued response to the COVID-19 pandemic. And we'll take your questions as soon as they are both finished, letting you know the latest about where we are in the county. And with that, I will turn it over to county executive also Brooks. Good morning everyone. I want to thank you for for being with us today as we discuss some important updates regarding COVID-19 in Prince George's county. I want to thank Dr. Carter for joining me again this morning and thank him and his entire team at the health department for the wonderful job they have done during this pandemic. And you'll hear from him after I speak and he will give you a more up to date and more in-depth update on the health of our residents in just a moment. We are currently at over 22,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 730 deaths because of this illness. And so we continue to send out our thoughts and prayers most especially to those who continue to suffer and so many who are grieving right now the loss of a loved one. In fact, I have many friends who also have lost parents and other family members. And so we just continue to remember them as they grieve the loss of their loved ones. I want to thank not only Dr. Carter and the health department team, but I want to thank all of our Prince George's county employees who have just done a stellar job continuing to keep this government running and just working so hard around the clock. I want to thank my team. They are nothing short of amazing. I want to thank all the front line workers, our firefighters and EMS and police officers and folks in our courthouse. Just everyone who continues to keep us moving forward during this pandemic. And I want to also take a few moments just to tell you a bit not only about COVID-19, but I'm going to talk this morning about police reform work, the work group that we have formed, and also discuss a bit about our Prince George's county forward task force. So we continue to monitor our data and metrics every day. And we have seen some good news. Our testing has increased. I tell you, Dr. Carter and this team has done an amazing job of acquiring those test kits. We have now tested more than 19,000 county residents for the week of July 18th. To tell you what progress we have made, that's more than double the number of tests that we had just two months ago. So 19,000 county residents who were tested in a week. Unfortunately, we've also identified a few concerning trends. Similar to other parts of our state, we've seen a slight increase in new cases. These cases are particularly following the July 4th weekend. The holiday weekend, we've seen a 56% increase in cases over the last couple of weeks where we had a low of 581 cases, the week of July 5th, to 909 cases for the week of July 12th. And so we are closely watching the lab results as they come in. And we will continue to watch as that trend continues to make sure that it's headed in the right direction. We also have seen our hospitalizations increase from an average of 45 patients per day with COVID-19 for the week of July 5th to 62 per day last week. Our positivity rate, which we have to tell you, we're just amazed at how far it's come, how you may recall that we had a 43% positivity rate in April. We were able to bring that positivity rate all the way down to 5.3%. We did see a slight increase and went back up to 5.8%. And what this says, and I know that Dr. Carter will reiterate this, but it means that COVID is still in our community and it's still spreading, and that we have to be very, very vigilant. We are very much on the line and we have to be really careful as we monitor that positivity rate. And so, the majority of our residents have done a beautiful job, I mean, an absolutely beautiful job of adhering to all of the advice and instructions that we've given them to wear the facial coverings, to social distance, to not host large gatherings, to be very careful. But we have also seen some who have been lax in terms of compliance. That's been some individuals and some of our businesses, which is why we created the COVID-19 Ambassador Compliance Teams. This includes more than 80 of our employees from across county government who perform unannounced visits to businesses to ensure that owners, employees and patrons are really complying with the COVID-19 safety protocols that have been outlined by our county. The first visits offer an educational opportunity on the requirements in a warning. After we have warned you and given you that educational material, we're coming back with a fine. The second visit to a business that is not in compliance results in a $1,000 fine and a corrective compliance form must be submitted. And finally, on the third visit to a business that is not in compliance, that will result in that business being shut down and closed until it has a plan in place to come into compliance. And our team has completed a reopening inspection. And so we are dead serious about this. As you know, this is a matter of life and death. And so our teams have visited more than 200 businesses across the county. I'm proud to say that the majority of those businesses are following the necessary guidelines and precautions. So far, we've not had to impose any of the $1,000 fines on any businesses, but we have had to close one business as a Marshall Arts facility that serves children because this business was unfortunately not practicing social distancing and did not have safe practices in place. We encourage our residents if they know or believe that a business is failing to comply with the Prince George County COVID-19 executive order. We want our residents to email us and let us know about these businesses that are of concern at COVID compliance at CO dot PG dot MD dot US. Again, that is COVID compliance at CO dot PG dot MD dot US. And you can also call us at 301 888 36548 301 8836548. If they suspect that a business isn't doing their part to protect our residents. Now, we know everyone is anxious to get back to business as usual. We know that our residents have grown weary. The summer months are here. It's really hard to wear those facial coverings, especially when it's so hot and humid outside. It really is difficult for all of us. And summers also a time where we enjoy socializing with family and friends. But again, if we cannot say it enough COVID-19. It's still very much a part of our community. The pandemic is not over. The pandemic continues and we need people to operate as if this is the case. And so it is important that you continue to wear those facial coverings that you practice social distancing. And in fact, yesterday, Governor Hogan announced that starting at 5 p.m. tomorrow, everyone will be required to wear a facial covering while indoors in public spaces and outdoors where six feet of social distancing is not possible. And so we want everyone to continue to be in compliance there. Dr Carter and our public health officials believe that we are not yet at the point where we have to begin to roll back some of the openings that we have done. We know we're watching and very vigilant. But we're not putting new restrictions in place. We're not rolling back the phases that we have implemented. But I want to stress that we want to avoid a setback in our recovery or potentially another shutdown. So we all have to do our best to make sure that the infection rate remains low and that we are very vigilant in listening to the advice that we've been given. Now, while many of our businesses are doing the right thing and abiding by the restrictions that have been put in place by our executive order, we are unfortunately seeing and there's one in every crowd. Some who are trying to circumvent the order by holding large house parties with hundreds of people in attendance. And these parties are unsafe. They could lead to additional spread of COVID-19. In fact, they're almost certain to lead to additional spread of COVID-19. And that's why we are taking swift action to stop parties like these from happening in April. The governor issued an executive order that delegated authority to local health officials to close unsafe facilities. This means that only the people who live there are able to be at that property. There are more parties with hundreds of people in attendance. And anyone who violates this order and this includes the owners of the property. Any promoters who host the party and anyone who attends the party will be subject to being charged with a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of up to one year in jail and a $5,000 fine or both. They're very serious. This again is no laughing matter. This is a very serious matter. We want we will use it on any property that is willfully violating the executive order and hosting these parties. And the parties again are unsafe for everyone involved. And so we want to make sure that we are doing our part not to allow the spread to happen. The contact tracing statewide tells us two very interesting things. It tells us the family gatherings and parties have been a major source of virus transmission over the last few weeks. In fact, approximately 44% of people reporting who report that they've gotten the COVID virus have been at a family gathering. 44%. So this is where people are picking this up and 23% report having been at a house party. So 67% of all of our new infections are coming from large family gatherings and from house parties. What's really interesting about that is we've been talking about businesses and business compliance. The businesses in our community have done their level best. They are doing an absolutely amazing job of making sure that they are safe. And so we have to also do our part as well. And making sure that no matter how much we want to the large cookouts and parties are really unsafe for us. And we know now 44%. I just want to say it again of all of our new infections are from people who have been at family gatherings. So our executive order state stays the gut gatherings must remain at no more than 100 people with appropriate physical distancing and facial coverings. And it is crucial to public health and to our continued efforts to recover from this pandemic that we continue to adhere to this restriction. Now while we continue to work through the pandemic and Dr. Carter and his team will continue to monitor the healthcare aspect of this. I want you to know that we're continuing our work as well through the Prince George's forward task force that is working to address the impacts of COVID-19 on all Prince George and the impacts we know are just really unimaginable. Some of what we've experienced in business on the struggle to recover educationally. I continue to mention the achievement gap that I am very concerned about. So education how how to recover how do we recover economically we'll be looking at all of these areas to make sure that we are moving forward in our task force co chairs. Our doctor Charlene dukes and David Velasquez and actually it is Bill Von Haney who is our co chair along with Dr. Charlene dukes and I have to just say oh my gosh how amazed and inspired we are if I can just take a second to say. Bill Von Haney who is co chair with Dr. dukes came here at this press conference many of you saw him standing at this lectern talking and he had to submit to brain surgery just one week later and we were deeply concerned but I have to tell you I received the call last week from Bill Von Haney I couldn't believe it he has more energy than anybody in this room and so he is recovering beautifully we continue to pray for him and he's very involved and continues to be involved in the work that we're doing with this task force he's committed to it. David Velasquez be clear as second chairing this for Bill Von Haney he's also doing an amazing job to in real time produce concrete recommendations that can be implemented in the immediate short and long term to launch to make sure that our county is able to move forward and so we're excited by the opportunities that we see as we have begun to identify them for our community the task force will have two public meetings in the coming weeks the first is on August 5th. And the second is on August 19th during these meetings which will be held virtually we will continue to outline our initial set of recommendations and they fall into three categories actions for today meaning what are the recommendations and guidance that is aimed right now at enhancing policy decisions that we've already implemented and in some cases offering additional policy recommendations that can be enacted by the end of the year again it involves everything from how do we tell a work. More efficiently what do we do in terms of government operations it talks about our business climate we have business leaders who are on this task force and so it is what actions should we take today. The second is visions for tomorrow and then a redefined future and so I am so proud of the work of our task force members they are doing a great job in providing us high quality recommendations that we will implement in real time. And so for more information about these meetings including how you can be a part of them and for more information about the recommendations you can go to www.Princhtjorge'sFour.com. Our Prince George's County Forward Task Force also wants to hear from our residents through an email path forward at CO.PG.MD.US and we will provide all of this information. I want to talk about two other quick topics one is a childcare update during this pandemic our parents have been hit especially hard and after our students have been sent home we know that our childcare facilities weren't far behind and so some of our childcare facilities in our county fortunately we're able to receive grant funding through our small business relief fund those childcare facilities receive the total of $735,000 to maintain. They are businesses during the shutdown these childcare facilities across our county have used the funds to pay roll cover mortgages and rent pay utilities and buy PPE for childcare workers but we know that during these very critical times one of the areas that we are very concerned about that will have a tremendous impact on so many of our families is what happens in the world of childcare as families start going back to work we know originally before the pandemic we had 25,000. We had 25,000 childcare slots in our county and now we have approximately 14,000 childcare slots that means we had 1100 day care providers we are now down to approximately 635 so this area has been decimated really hit hard it is something that we know will impact our families and so in the coming days we are going to announce more information about how we will assist these families assist the fathers and mothers this is an area that we know will have long standing implications and so I'm proud to announce that I have delegated $2 million in assistance for our childcare providers an additional $2 million out of our cares act funding to make sure that we're doing what we can to to really support our families and to support our children it is our hope that these funds will help these facilities to reopen remain open and provide safe and reliable childcare for all of our families and as I mentioned we're still working out the details but please stay tuned to our social media. We have a lot of social media pages at CEX also books on Facebook and Twitter as well as our newsletter and our county government homepage my PGC.US for more updates to come will continue to provide information I want to talk as well about our election the upcoming election and to give a quick update on it the governor has announced that the election will operate as a normal election but with the absentee ballots being must request being mailed to every voter. So what that means I'm sorry let me make sure I'm clear about this is that the governor has announced that we will go back to a normal election and unlike what we did in June where the ballots were were mailed to the homes of voters he's now asking that absentee ballot request be mailed in to every voter and the voter has to request the absentee ballot. Now I have joined with other county executives and setting a letter to the governor to ask him to reverse his decision and conduct the election primarily by mail we've already set the precedent for we want to do like we did in June to to during the primary we want to be able to conduct the election in the same way for us to be able to fully staff all of our polling locations and I want everybody to hear me as it takes 3,500 volunteers to do that 3,500 volunteers and that's just something that we're not going to do. So we're not going to be able to do in the middle of a pandemic many of the venues that normally serve as polling places such as senior centers churches and private halls have withdrawn because they do not want to serve as polling places during a pandemic and we know that most of those election judges are seniors and it is extremely unsafe to ask seniors to go into these facilities and host an in person election. So we conducted a survey and the survey we conducted revealed that only 34% of our trained poll workers indicated a willingness to work. So only 34% of the folks who we're usually able to rely on have said they're coming back they're not coming back to volunteer in the middle of a pandemic and for these reasons I continue to believe that it is not feasible nor is it safe for us to open 245 polling locations across the county and that we should instead focus primarily on mail and ballots as we did for the primary election. And so today in addition to what we've done with my colleagues from across the state I am also sending another letter to the governor asking him to extend the early voting timeline from October 22nd through November 3rd of this year I will also be asking him to allow Prince George's County to expand to 15 early voting locations and to use only those locations on election day. We want to be able to install secure drop boxes at the 15 polling locations and I'm also calling on the governor to abandon the idea of mailing ballot applications to residents and instead just mail the ballots. We've done it before we did it in June and we've seen that this idea of requesting an absentee ballot just doesn't work we can look at the state of Georgia they spent five to 10 million dollars mailing applications for ballot and due to many of the last minute applications that they struggle to process voters had to go to the polls anyway and stood in line for hours and hours and hours and hours it just didn't work and so during our primary election what we know is that it works to mail those ballots into the homes not only works but it increased voter participation we want to increase voter participation not decrease it and so using a primarily mail in ballots we saw the highest voter turnout that we've seen since the 2008 presidential election so for us it really worked. So us, which we're talking about spoke about the voting locations, mailing ballots to all register voters can ensure that they have the opportunity to vote and what is a critical election while also protecting public safety by minimizing crowds and long lines during the input person voting and so by mail this ballot to all of our voters Maryland can continue to leave the nation and protecting the health of all of its residents and citizens and so at this time make sure you are registered to vote request your absentee ballot So take the time to request that absentee ballot. We're encouraging everyone to vote by mail. You can request your ballot be mailed to you right now without having to wait for the state to mail you that request. You can just go ahead and ask for it. Just visit our local board of elections website at elections.mypgc.com. We will keep you updated on this, but it is my intention to continue to urge the governor that this is just not safe for Prince Georgeans. And again, putting many of our seniors' health and well-being at risk. And our poll workers have already said they're not showing up. So this is a much safer way for us to do it. I want to update you on also, lastly, on the latest with our police reform work group. The police reform work group has begun to study and review policies of the police department across a full spectrum of its operations, including hiring, training, and use of force policies. I want to thank our co-chairs, Judge Maureen Lemazny, and also delegate Alonzo Washington for working on these important issues for us. They're doing an amazing job in leading us along with a very talented and diverse group of activists, those who are involved in criminal justice, and other professionals. And so I want to thank them with the help of the group. We have an opportunity to be safer and more equitable for all of our residents. I think we have a chance to make sure that Prince Georgeans County is a national leader on police reform. We are very proud, although we know we have a ways to go. We believe that Prince Georgeans County has made meaningful progress over the years, that we have had, for example, the eight-cant wait recommendations as a part of our general orders for more than a decade. And while we have also seen some other areas of concern, we're addressing them daily. We, for example, have established a partnership with the community college, Prince George's community college to provide courses to officers to help them study for exams and improve their test taking to make sure that we're able to help everyone to take part in the promotional process. These programs began earlier this year. Some of them have been interrupted due to COVID, but we're going to continue them to make sure that equity is a huge part of what we do. So we're looking forward to hearing from our residents on these important issues. Last week, we had the first full meeting of the work group where we heard from our community. And as we move forward, it's extremely important to get community input. The feedback we gathered from our residents helps us to chart a course forward for our police department. But I also want to say something else to make it very clear. And let me just be clear about this. This work is not work that I'm new to. I served as the elected prosecutor in this state for, in this county for, for eight years. And holding officers accountable is something that I am not unfamiliar with. We've had to do it. And in the cases where it was necessary, that's exactly what we did. And so we, I've never been a person who is afraid to make a hard decision or to hold people accountable and we won't start now. And so the issues that we have, we recognize that we have issues and we're going to address every one of those issues. And I want to thank everyone who has engaged us in this process. This is important work. It is work that we will do together. But the thing that we are not going to do, I wanted to say a couple of things. We are not going to litigate a lawsuit in the media. We're not going to do that. One press conference after the next. You know, as you all know, a lawsuit, I was sued my second week in office. The Hylaya lawsuit came out my second week in office. And that lawsuit is one that we take very serious. We have a council representing us in court, which is where the lawsuit should be resolved. The lawsuit was filed in court. It should be resolved in court. It should not be resolved in press conferences and on social media. And so we're going to make sure that there is an appropriate way to address these concerns. And we're going to do it there. And the same is true regarding personnel issues. I'm not going to resolve personnel issues at press conferences. I'm not going to resolve personnel issues on social media. I'm not going to be. So this is just, you know, I think it's important to say that we, that there is a way to answer all of our concerns and to make sure that it is done in the appropriate venue. And so I am going to make sure the thing the public knows is that again, I'm not afraid to make a tough decision. This is important to all of us. And we're going to make sure that we get it right. And we're not going to stop until we get it right in the reforms that have to be made. We're going to make sure we make them. I think they're important too, but I just want to make sure that it is done in the proper venue. So we will do that. So that is what we have to say about that. So I'll end by saying that these have been some difficult months for us, but we have worked together. Prince Georgians, I tell you, there's nothing like Prince Georgians. They have done an amazing job just in every way. And I want to thank all of you for everything that you have done. The sacrifices that you have made, the way that you care for each other, the facial coverings that you have worn without us begging. Nobody's had to convince Prince Georgians that they needed to wear the facial coverings or that they needed to social distance or go home. I mean, you all have done an amazing job and our numbers continue to demonstrate that. I want to thank you for your engagement on every issue from the health issues to the police reform issues. You just couldn't ask for any more. So I want to thank everyone for your engagement and we will get through this together. So at this point, I want to turn over the program to Dr. Carter. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you, Madam County Executive, for your leadership and support throughout this pandemic. COVID-19 is still very much around us. We continue to spread in Prince Georgian County. As a region, we've seen an uptick in cases, hospitalizations, and the infection rate. Since the beginning of July, we've had at least two weeks of increases in new COVID cases. We're getting close to seeing a thousand new cases each week. The last time we had a thousand new cases a week was almost two months ago. We began seeing the cases increase after July 4th weekend. We went from 581 new COVID cases to 808 after July 4th. The next week after that, we saw 909 new cases. Now this is in part due to the fact that we're doing a whole lot more testing. The more recent data show, we're doing somewhere around 20,000, close to 20,000 COVID tests for our Prince Georgian County residents each week. This is our highest mark of the pandemic so far. More than 160,000 tests have been done for county residents to date. However, the increase in the new cases we're experiencing right now also shows a stubborn and persistent increase in community spread of COVID-19. Right now, almost 6% of those tests are becoming back positive. This is evident that physical distancing and other protective measures, both in the county and nationwide, have not been as robust as we should have had them. We must stay vigilant about avoiding crowds, stay in six feet apart and wearing a mask, also cleaning your hands, and making sure your surface is a clean. Case in point. If anyone out there has been to a large party lately, we strongly recommend you come get tested. Half of our new cases are people who are in their 20s and 30s. Gatherings with family and friends is the most common way people are getting infected right now. You can get tested for free and without an appointment at one of the health department's testing sites across the county. You also don't need to be showing symptoms. You don't need a prescription and you don't need insurance. Call 311 for testing location information or visit the county's website. As we test more, we are also tracing more. Our tracing, a contact tracing operation continues to expand. We're training more people each week to get in touch with people who are tested positive COVID-19. We're making sure those patients self-isolate for 14 days and they closely monitor their health. Our contact traces then track down who else may have come in contact with that positive person. So those people can also quarantine and follow the same instructions. If you see on your caller ID, MD COVID, please answer it so we can keep you and others safe. Our hospitalizations are going up again. Last week, an average of 62 people were hospitalized due to COVID in the county. That's a 24% jump from the previous week with 50 people who hospitalized for COVID. We're encouraged by the fact that our bed space in our hospital systems remain adequate. About 60% of the ICU and acute beds are available in county hospital. The sustained bed capacity is due in large part to our great work of our hospital systems working with the health department and the office of emergency management and we can't thank them enough. Our partnership has helped maintain critical PPE supplies for frontline medical staff as well as building additional medical facilities on the hospital grounds to care for those with and without COVID. Ten of our fellow Prince George's died due to COVID-19 complications due July 12th to the 18th. The number of residents who have died from the virus has been below 15 per week for about a month now. But with increases in new cases and hospitalizations, the number of our community members, we lose me go up again. This is a really big concern for the health department. The county infection rate is still too high. The infection rate measures how many other people a COVID positive person infects. Right now, our infection rate continues to linger in the 1.1 range. That means each COVID positive person in Prince George's County is infecting on average over one other person. That puts us at high risk for an outbreak. We want the infection rate to be far below one as possible to slow the spread and we're working hard to get there. No matter what the numbers look like at a particular time doing this pandemic, the most basic protocol for preventing spread stays the same. At minimum, we must physically distance, frequently wash your hands, wear a mask when you're around other people who are not members of your household. If you go out to any public business or building, you must wear a mask. If you're in any outdoor area where physical distance is not possible, you must wear a mask. This essentially means if you expect to come in within six feet for someone who is not in your household, you must wear a mask. This is to be smart about your surroundings. Avoid crowded areas in public and wash your hands as much as you can. I know I repeat this a lot, but this is the most important thing you can do. I'm so proud of how our county has persevered so far. Most of you are heating this important call to stay safe and be cautious about your travels. Remember, you're safer at home. I do remain concerned about the emotional toll this pandemic has taken on all of us. COVID has been so rough for so many families. Over 700 Prince Georgians have died due to complications and more than 3,000 have been hospitalized. And that's very traumatic on our population. But the emotional experience has been even more harsh. We've watched the virus take our loved ones and we haven't been able to see them when they're in the hospital. All of this stress then turns around to affect our overall health and well-being. To reduce the stress, make sure you eat right. I'm starting with the basics. This means fruits and vegetables. And you know, other foods, but make sure you're eating healthy food. Avoid foods that are high in sugar, salt, or caffeine because they can increase stress. Drink a lot of water, especially doing these really, really hot days. It's plenty of sleep, which is very important. Please avoid alcohol and drugs. Throughout the pandemic, our hospital systems and our behavioral health partners have seen an increase in overdoses. This is really alarming. Exercise is also a stress-reducer. It increases the body's ability to fight off stress with anti-anxiety hormones and it produces endorphins that can help you feel calmer. Talk with people you trust about how you're feeling or call loved ones just to say hi or just to check in. It's going to take a village to beat this virus. You are not alone. No more than ever, we need to find creative ways to stay connected to each other and find the support and the care we all need to get through this historic challenge as a people. If you need help, please dial 211 and dial 1. I'm confidence we will get over any future bumps in the road to recovery if we work together as a team. Be on our best behavior and show how Prince George's County can beat this COVID-19. Thank you. We will open it up now to any questions that you guys have. Tracy. So what are you doing now, the residents, who are saying that the parts of the system that we are watching have been going on for more than a week and not three days, not the entire weekend, but a seven-year-old. So part of the reason is that this is a state that is between two. We need to use it to a real life. So we have taken action to make sure that we are closing down the parties at the Broad Water Manchin. That should be known. We have to tell you very simply that we had to have in place the tools to enforce at that property. Governor gave the responsibility to the health department and allowed health officers to shut down establishments that are not complying with the requirements and what it requires is that we go to those properties as I explained before we educate, we find and then we shut down. Now our police have responded to this location and in fairness, they show up there and they're not always treated so well. In this day and time when everybody has a camera phone, you can imagine the peril that we put our officers in. We ask them to show up, we want them to enforce, but they show up, they are abused, cursed at and treated horribly. And some of them to be honest with you are afraid. In this climate, you go and engage in a crowd of 100 or so people and you do the job that people ask you to do and then you are mistreated. So the police have gone there. We had to come up with a smart strategy to make sure that we are now closing down that particular venue which means the people can't come there in the first place. So what we have the authority to do going forward is to make sure that the party goers can never convene because it's too late once the party occurs. You come there, try to disperse a crowd with hundreds of people. It's a very dangerous proposition. I have to be honest with you. It is a very dangerous proposition. So we have instead used a different tact now to shut down that particular place. That venue is not allowed to host those parties so that when people come to the party now they can be turned away. And that's a much better strategy. But it is not the case. Let's be clear that we have permitted this to happen. We have to enforce using the tools that we have available to us. But there is a very human dynamic also that again, you show up. And it's difficult to disperse a crowd of hundreds of people safely. And so the better thing to do is make sure they never convene in the first place. So I have to add the question. The question is, if you want to comment on the issue, you're saying that the public is not allowed to host places. That means on how they will be allowed to happen. No. If any of the public is, the public is a person who is still going to call and have conversation with the public. Can you jump in front of that? Can you play over the radio? Yeah. Yeah, no, that has nothing whatsoever to do with why those parties were convened, which is why that establishment is closed right now. It doesn't matter who owns it. If it's Tommy Broadwater or some other person, any establishment like that one that convenes now in an unsafe fashion like that one will be shut down. If they do not comply with our orders, and so it has nothing whatsoever, we don't care whose property it is. So I don't know where that came from, but it's certainly as far as we are concerned. There has been no instruction given whatsoever to respect who the owner is. It doesn't matter who it is. If you are not complying, we're going to enforce at that property. And then may I have further questions? I'm sorry. Can you reach out to the wrong part and do yourself? No. I don't reach out to any of these businesses. I let Dr. Carter, the health department and the police enforce. That's where it's appropriate. This is not personal. This is business. What we have to do is I didn't reach out to him. He isn't reached out to me. Nobody's reached out to me for that matter for many of these businesses because we're going to enforce the law. If you could do 100 or under and the operator. No. This particular venue can't operate with 10 people. It's done because it has not complied with our orders. And so it's been shut down. And that's how we're going to treat every business. We will give you the proper warnings. And if you don't adhere to those warnings, then we can't operate your unsafe establishment. And then ask the promoter to eventually try to find out their locations. If you get up with those, do you get that that information? Yeah. So we're keeping up with it as best we can. The truth of the matter is, come on everybody. Really, this is not the time for, you know, there will be a time for it. This year in the middle of a pandemic is just not the time. Virtual, most of us are doing kind of virtual gatherings and that kind of thing. But it just doesn't. It defies common sense and good judgment to host parties with hundreds of people. It's so irresponsible and so reckless and dangerous. And the thing about it is the party goers who are primarily in their 20s and 30s, many of them have the attitude that they don't get sick or die. But the truth of the matter is, yes, they do get sick. Over 50% of our new infections are 20 and 30 year olds who feel, in many cases, that they can't get sick and feel invincible, but they go home and give it to elders who die. So we have to be more responsible and really care about how we contract this virus and spread it on because you may not die of it, but somebody you love may. So this is very serious. And Chevrolet? Oh, wow. I got tested there this Monday and I got my test result yesterday. We don't want people to have that experience, but I can tell you from my personal experience, I went back there this week and on Monday to get tested to be honest before I go on vacation with my family and we got it back in 48 hours, so that's that experience. But I know that there are some who have had a different experience. As we hear that, we're following it up on it. I know that Dr. Carter is following up as well to make sure because we want people to get, it defeats the purpose not to get a quick test result. That's the whole point is that we want people to know, many of whom are asymptomatic before they spread it. But that's been the experience. Dr. Carter, do you want to add something? I'm simply going to have a question and question all of that. I got to a bit of a mask. The answer is yes. So as you well know and you all have seen the news, the United States, the testing has gone up exponentially across the country. So the national labs in particular get overwhelmed. And so we have noticed that that was an average, seven point four days it was taken at one point of getting test results back. Some people, two weeks, other people 48 hours. And it depends on the lab and where they were in their processes. We're really working really hard to press them to get our lab results. It doesn't make sense as to how many execs said, forget us to get lab results back to late. But it is a problem. It's a national problem. I just kind of wonder if there is a little bit more of a problem than that. I'm sort of telling you the news and the vision of the moment. That's a good fact. What happens if all the time we go on the phone, you can imagine things like that, you want to turn it at the high number of examples. But do you have a major question? Well, I will tell you that currently there's an ongoing investigation because when what happened, I will respond to this. But at the time in March, that was a raging pandemic going on. More than anywhere else in Maryland, Prince George's County actually experienced the highest number and had the highest infectivity rate at that time. And it was March. So there was a lot of things that were going on that people may have thought that they experienced. But what the health department did was follow the CDC guidelines. And we did the work that we knew we had to do. And the reason is, is because everybody in the health department, starting with me, knew we needed to save lives. And I've been in this business for 30 years. And all I've been concentrating on is trying to figure out how I can better save people's life. My father was in public health. My brother's a physician, my wife's a physician, his wife. And I'm just telling you that what we did was everybody who surrounded me and they knew this, that we had to follow the principles of public health. That first one was to protect people's health. That was the first and foremost. And then we also had to, as part of our mission, to promote personal responsibility for prevention. And so we did everything, everything we were supposed to do during that period. But as, and I'll let the county executive address this, as you will know, we're doing an internal investigation. And I'll let her expand on a little bit more. So Ms. Max death hurt all of us. It is the worst case scenario that we would lose one of our employees who was there courageously working to save lives. And so it was worst case scenario for us. We're going to loss of Ms. Mack and we believe that it deserves an investigation. I want to know what happened. I know Dr. Carter wants to make sure that there is nothing different that we should be doing right now to make sure that we are protecting the health and safety not only of Prince George but those who are working on the front line to make sure every day that this work gets done. So Ms. Mack and all of our colleagues at the health department are important to us. As Dr. Carter said in March, what we knew in March is very different than what we know today in July. And all of our workspaces, the way that we were working in March, is different than today because that pandemic occurred and we had never seen it before. So many of the rules that we've implemented, the policies that we've implemented, they have evolved since March. As we know better, we're going to continue to do better. But I want Ms. Mack's family to know that we are so very sorry for their loss. But their loss is also our loss that our health department lost, a valued employee that our county lost one and that we will make sure that we spare no time or expense in turning over every stone to understand what happened that led to her death. And to make sure that if there are things that we should adjust, we absolutely will do it to make sure that all of our workers not only are safe, but they have to feel safe to come to work. They have to feel safe and that's important to us. No, there is not. We were planning to try to face some back in the fall. We have now pushed that back. We don't believe it's safe to do so. So we are continuing to tell a work and to make sure that we are monitoring our situation, the numbers and such and we'll bring people back when we believe it's safe to do so. Well, unfortunately we can't get into the lab and force certain timelines on them, but we are watching. And I think Dr. Carter can answer this too, but we are watching it and we try to use labs that we think are best for us. And so that's what we're selecting labs that we think are responsive, but in terms of getting in the lab and changing how the lab results occurs. This is a problem again that is happening nationally right now, is unfortunately as we see these surges that are happening across the country, we are increasing our testing. We are now up to 20,000 tests per week. That's a lot of tests. And so as we were saying, it's more than double what we were doing two months ago. And because of that, we're seeing some backlogs, but it varies. I'm hearing some people have an experience, was 48 hours to 72 hours. And the instance is where it's longer than that. We're following up with the labs. We're trying to make sure that people get those results quickly because like we said, it doesn't make sense to get a lab result seven days, nine days after that point, it's too dangerous to do that. So I don't know, Dr. Cardiff, is anything additional to that? I mean, it's in what you mentioned before in the lab. No, but that would be good, we would. I do know that the state is working diligently to expand their capability. They have the ability to turn it over quickly, but they haven't had the ability to handle the volumes. So they have been working to expand that capability. And once the testing, the labs build up their capability, we should be able to get back down to the 48 hour, 24 to 48 hour turnaround time. The governor has suggested that people go to the state, the vision state, go to the state line, and then go to turnaround to the university and the university. Are you at the point where he has suggested that the people may be supposed to go into the state line? It will, it will, it just like everything else. If they shift over there, they will not have in seven days turnaround and share really will have. I mean, you understand. It's one of those things we just can't control. So this, the food insecurity issue, as you know has been one I've taken up from the beginning of this. And we are so much in the thick of this, especially now as we see for example, the moratorium on some of the evictions will be lifted. We're seeing also that the $600 additional that you got in the unemployment benefits will soon be expiring. So we're very concerned about our families who are experiencing food insecurities. Now, we have put together a really robust program that will provide those meals at least three times a week. We believe that we have the resources to follow through through the end of the year. But I am continuing to go out and to seek out even private funding to make sure that we're able to continue. I have, after this press conference, I actually have some calls today that we are actually encouraging people to make donations to stand up and deliver. And so anyone who hears this press conference and who has the ability to support us, please help us. These families are out hours long waiting in line for food. And we're going to make sure that we do everything we can to meet the need. And John is here. John Erzen, our deputy chief of staff. John has been the person who's been in charge of stand up at delivery. Let me see whether there's anything additional going to add to that. Sure. Thank you. Ms. Also Brooks. Just briefly, just on the stand up and deliver program, as the county executive mentioned, it is a program that we have stood up in the county executive's office and it's a partnership with the United Way of the national capital area. And we are doing prepared meal distributions that we do twice a week and this week we are also starting the grocery box distributions. And the way that the program works, it really is a great model that allows us to work with local nonprofits and local restaurants and local grocers so that while we are helping them, you know, put their people back to work through this pandemic, they are also helping us, you know, to resolve some of this food insecurity. And as the county executive said, these prepared meal distributions and these grocery box distributions will be going on through the end of the year. Right now we are able to sustain it. But certainly we need additional support. As the county executive mentioned, she is working on that and we encourage anyone who is able to support the program. You can find the information on our coronavirus site, on how to donate. You can also go directly to the United Way webpage at unitedwaynca.org slash pgc delivers and all of the options are there on how you can donate to this program to help us continue to address food insecurity. And we are going to continue to work with all of our partners here both locally and regionally to continue to address this problem. So can I make a one final question? I wanted to ask around with a press conference. I would tell those questions, the promotion process, the rest of it. There was someone who made you a long-rack fall that was tired of watching, which you would have been able to do. So you know lawsuits, the criminal justice system is important. And I believe that people have a right to file grievances and that is the reason we have the justice system. And the county is responsible for responding to litigation and responding to those lawsuits. We will do so in the way that is most responsible. We want to resolve every one of those concerns in a way that is fair not only to the people who are filing them but to the county. And that takes time. It means that in some instances we mediate those. We are represented by the office of law and they guide us in our approach to each of those complaints. But I do understand that people are tired of hearing about the lawsuits. But it is important that people are able to bring their concerns forward and that we answer them. And I am all for that. That people have a right to have their grievances heard. Now the thing that you heard me say here today is for example the lawsuit, the Hille assault lawsuit was filed my second week in office. And it was relating to promotional practices that occurred before I was county executive. And it was filed in the court of law and I think that is where it should be resolved. I think what people are tired of is a press conference every week to hash out the details of a lawsuit when the lawsuit should be resolved in court. Is filed in court appropriately so and it should be resolved in court. As I think the public is fatigued of every week turning on the television and hearing on the news or in a paper something more about the lawsuit that they know should be resolved there. So we want the lawsuit, we want the concern to be addressed. I will address the concern. The county has a responsibility to answer. If there is some discrimination that is occurring we want to address it. If there are practices that need to be changed we have a police reform commission that is reviewing all of our policies and practices and we will address whatever the concerns all but I think the public is fatigued of every week. We can't resolve personal issues at press conferences nor should we. It's not the appropriate forum for it. We can't resolve lawsuits at press conferences. It's not the appropriate forum. I think that's what the public is fatigued of. I think that's what the public is fatigued of.",

        "transcript": " Maryland's US Senator Ben Cardin retires next year. His departure will leave a rare open seat in the Senate. We're months from the primary election, but the list of Democratic and Republican candidates running to replace Cardin is growing. We're speaking with all of the candidates to help you decide at the polls. And tonight our Larry Miller talks with Angela also Brooks, who is currently the Prince George's County Executive. I'm running for Senate to be a voice for families like the ones I grew up with here. Angela also Brooks is on a mission to be Maryland's next US Senator. The 52 year old Prince George's County Executive and mother has mounted an aggressive campaign. So far, she's racked up more than 80 endorsements, including support from Senator Chris Van Holland and Congressman Stenny Hoyer. Recent campaign filing show also Brooks has raised nearly $2 million. It's the most money raised by campaign contributions. Why do you feel that you should be the next Senator for Maryland? I believe very firmly that Marylanders deserve a Senator who not only fights hard for them, but who understands them and shares the concerns of everyday hard working families. I've spent my career focused on families, the issues of growing economic opportunity. What do you think is about your message that's really resonating with people? I think voters want someone who share their lived experience. A person like myself who is not only raising as a working mom, a teenage daughter, but I am also working as a part of that sandwich generation to care for my aging parents. This helps me to understand so clearly the issues of everyday families. Also Brooks isn't alone in her quest to replace Senator Cardin. Others have declared including Congressman David Trone, Montgomery County Councilman Will Joando, telecom executive Juan Dominguez, and activist Jerome Segal, Trone Missile Funded. He's the co-owner of Total Wine and More and has both infused and spent millions of dollars so far. Do you feel that Congressman David Trone really is your primary challenger in this race? I've been well noted that I have a person in the race who says he's going to spend $50 million of his own money in this race. Raising money is important. Being able to communicate is important, but I think what is most important is focusing on the issues again that everyday families care about living in a place that is safe. True economic opportunity, creating jobs and increasing income. You have a close relationship with the Vice President. I wonder what advice she's given you about your campaign, what to do, and maybe what things to stay away from. The Vice President really has been a great friend and mentor. She helped me as state's attorney. Many of the restorative justice programs and we were able to implement. We learned about through the work that she was doing. One of the things that she has some advice she's given that I've used recently is I said to her, you know, what do you wish you had known? And she said she wished that she had journal more. To really document the beautiful experiences that she had had all along the way. And so I have done that in this campaign for the first time. Also Brooks were to win the primary and then the general election. She would be Maryland's first black U.S. Senator and the third black woman to hold a seat in the body. Do those distinctions matter to you? The historic nature of this race is not lost on me. But I can tell you that I know that voters will consider a number of factors. I think gender will be one of the factors that they consider maybe raised. But I can tell you that there will be other factors that voters consider, especially experience. And when they consider experience, I think they'll find that I have the best experience of anyone in this race. Larry Miller, W USA 9.",

        "transcript": " A senator who will stand on the side of the middle class. A senator who will wake up every morning and fight for the middle class. They've told me that they want an economy in which everyone plays by the same rules and everyone does their fair share. They've told me that they want a level playing field. One where China can't cheat our workers and millionaires can't dodge taxes and Wall Street can't catch our economy with the risky gambling. They've told me that they want to pay down our debt without short-changing our future. They've told me that they want to be able to rely on the guarantees of Medicare and Social Security not just today but for future generations. Most of all, they've told me that the special interests have too much power in Washington and it's time for the people's voice to be heard. And it's time for the people's voice to be heard. Well, the people's voice was heard tonight Wisconsin and Tom January, your voice will be heard in the United States Senate. I am honored and humbled and grateful and I'm ready to get to work. I'm ready to stand with President Barack Obama. I'm ready to fight for Wisconsin's middle class. Now, I am well aware that I will have the honor to be Wisconsin's first woman, U.S. Senator. And I am well aware that I will be the first openly gay member. But I didn't run to make history. I ran to make a difference. A difference in the lives of families struggling to find work and pay the bills. A difference in the lives of students worried about debt. And seniors worried about their retirement security. A difference in the lives of veterans who fought for us and need someone fighting for them and their families. A difference in the lives of entrepreneurs trying to build a business and working people trying to build some economic security. But in choosing me to tackle those challenges, the people of Wisconsin have made history. And I can't tell you how grateful I am for the trust that you've placed in me. And all I can do is work as hard as I can to keep that trust. I know that many of the people listening to this speech tonight may not have voted for me. But I want you to know that I will stand up for you. And I ask you to work with me to move our state forward. And I want to thank you for your support. Here is the promise I want to make you. I will be a senator for all of Wisconsin. I will be a senator from both political parties and all across the ideological spectrum. And I have a lot of good examples to follow. One is Herb Cole. You know that when he first ran for the U.S. Senate, his slogan was nobody's senator but yours. And of course of his service, that slogan became a title, one that he has earned every day that he has served the state of Wisconsin. I am so grateful to have had his support throughout this campaign and humbled to carry his deep commitment to public service. I also want to thank Tommy Thompson for his life in public service. And before I do, I would like you to indulge me in an acknowledgement on a very personal level. I just got off the phone with him. He was very cordial and congratulated me and wished me well and wished all of us well. I want to tell you a quick little story about Tommy Thompson on a very personal level. I still remember the first time I ever met Tommy. I was 30 years old and a freshman member of the Wisconsin Assembly. He was greeting new members of the legislature at the governor's mansion. We didn't talk politics. I explained to the governor that I was Joe Baldwin's daughter and that I had never met him before my father passed away. Tommy's face lit up. He had known my father in college and he would delight in sharing some small remembrance every time I saw him. And that meant the world to me. Tommy and I didn't always agree. In fact, in this campaign we didn't agree on much. But there can be no doubt that he shares my love and all of our love for Wisconsin. And tonight I want to reach out to his supporters and ask them to join me in standing up for our belief that we are all in this together. Now, make no mistake. I am a proud Wisconsin progressive. And I, which means I believe in holding the powerful accountable. I believe in fair play. And I believe that when people are struggling, you don't talk down to them. You help lift them up. And I believe and I believe in Wisconsin's workers and a work ethic that I will fight for every day. But I also believe that we can only move forward if we move forward together. This has been an incredible journey. One that has shown me the best that our state has to offer. I've watched Wisconsin workers put the Made in America label on boots for our soldiers in Maryland, on ships made in Marinette, and engines made in Baloid. I've met with potato farmers in Clover. I've eaten while I in Fondelac. And the best cream puffs in the world at the state fair in West Dallas. And I am grateful to so many people tonight. I want to thank the people of the second congressional district for giving me the honor of serving you for the last 14 years. And I want to congratulate Mark Pocan, who will give you a perfect job representing. It has been a privilege to serve in the House of Representatives. And I had a hard working dedicated team of congressional staff who do incredible work in my name, but on your behalf. I have led by my dear friend and chief of staff, Bill Marott. I want to recognize these amazing people. I am grateful for all the elected officials and public servants who stood with me throughout this campaign. And in particular, I want to single out one more. I want to thank you for the last 14 months. I have never been a part of a campaign organization as amazing as this one. And I want to thank my friend and campaign manager, Karen Johansson. I want to thank her for helping me build this team of determined, inspirational and incredible staff, supporters, volunteers. It has been incredible. And I am grateful for the campaign. Now, you've all heard a lot about my grandparents who raised me. And especially my grandmother, she was born in 1906 before women had the right to vote and got to live to see her granddaughter elected to the House of Representatives. I know she would be proud tonight. I am happy and so fortunate to have with me tonight my mother Pam. Now, among all the things I could tell you about her, she had the prophetic wisdom to name me Tammy. And how could she have known that one day there would be headlines reading Tammy versus Tommy? I also am joined this evening by my aunts and uncle, Sarah, Melinda and Guy. And I just want to thank my family for their love, support and encouragement. So tonight a long journey comes to an end, but we know our work is just beginning. And whether you voted for me or not, whether tonight you're celebrating a victory or dealing with a defeat. I hope that when we wake up tomorrow morning, we are ready to work. Ready to fight. Ready to fight for our middle class. Ready to keep our promises to our seniors. Ready to have a level playing field for our workers. Ready to make sure that everyone has a fair shot. Ready to make our country stronger, more prosperous and more equal. Ready to do what Wisconsinites have done for generations. Stand together and move forward. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " We have been very blessed to have a wonderful senator in the state of Wisconsin. Her name is Tammy Baldwin. And she has been an advocate for a very important part of agriculture. And that is the promotion of public plant breeding, helping the land grant universities move forward with basically retaking over their space in producing seeds that are regionally adapted and that are open for public use. That has kind of diminished over the past few years. And she has helped us a lot by working in her place on the Senate Agricultural Appropriations Committee by putting language directing the USDA to put more money into research in this important area. In addition, she is a wonderful place when I go to Washington, D.C. to feel that I'm walking into an office with a friendly face and a wonderful demeanor. And I also know that she works really hard. And if Tammy is going to say that she's going to do something, she's going to get it done. So with that, I'd like to have our senator from Wisconsin, Tammy Baldwin, come up and give you a little address. So, well, good afternoon. What an honor it is to join you at the 27th annual Moses Conference. It is also an honor to have gotten to watch the proceedings. And I want to just add my words of gratitude to you, Fay, for your remarkable work and the remarkable legacy that you are leaving. And I'm going to take you at your word because I hope to come back again. I hope to see you here even in a different capacity. Thank you. So, I just want to say that it is a deep honor to get the opportunity to represent a state with such a deep and enduring agricultural innovation tradition. In fact, our grown-in Wisconsin economy, the sector contributes $88.3 billion in economic activity and provides about 413,000 jobs, employing almost one out of nine people in the state of Wisconsin. The Moses attendees here today include some of the pioneers of the organic and sustainable agriculture movements. These are folks who remember the time before the organic seal. The time before we invested in dedicated organic research, before organic was one of the fastest growing parts of the agricultural industry. Those farmers and agricultural experts poured countless hours into and created the bold vision that there need to be viable markets for the organic industry, and also the growing organic agriculture could be a critical part of keeping families on the farm and keeping many small farms on our beautiful landscape, and keeping our rural communities and quality of life strong because of that. Here today, we also have some of our newest farmers, and probably many people who are thinking about a life in organic agriculture. We want to hear from these new and aspiring farmers, hear about their challenges, hear about what helps them succeed so that we can continue to support this vibrant sector of our agriculture industry, and rural communities that need young farmers to keep them strong. Organic is one of the fastest growing sectors of the agricultural economy nationwide, and over the past few decades, organic production has grown rapidly here in the Badger State. With nearly 1200 certified organic farmers and handlers, Wisconsin ranks second to only the state of California in the number of organic farms. But as you all know, we have work to do in order to move forward. We need to help future organic farmers get their start and ensure that organic farmers have the tools that they need to succeed. And it's why I have fought and will continue to fight for increased investments for the organic transitions program. This program supports the development and implementation of research in higher education and extension programs to improve the competitiveness of organic livestock and crop producers, and help offset the costs of transitioning to organic production for individual farmers. The Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship Program is also a wonderful Wisconsin innovation, and I have advocated for this program, because it's based on a great coalition of dairy grazers across Wisconsin, who have worked to make dairy grazing not only feasible, but also respected as a growing part of our dairy industry. Now the apprenticeship program pairs young aspiring farmers with farmers nearing retirement to help with farm transitions and help the next generation get its start. I'm also proud to have been a strong supporter of the Farm Bill's conservation programs, including the Conservation Stewardship Program and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program. And the creation of better risk management tools, including crop insurance for organic crops. I have taken on these fights and been a voice for you in Washington because I understand that in Wisconsin farming is not just a part of the economy, it's a way of life that must be strengthened and protected. You represent an ethic of caring for our land and providing healthy food for our families and our neighbors. Well, organic farmers don't use the same tools to respond to farming challenges that conventional farmers use, such as chemical pesticides and fertilizers and certain seeds. Organic farmers are extremely innovative in finding ways to manage pests and crop issues and raise livestock in an ecologically sensitive way. What that means, of course, is that not all agricultural research is useful to organic producers. We need to increase investments in organic agriculture to help producers increase yields, improve disease resistance and deal with our changing climate. So I am pressing the USDA to invest in publicly available plant and animal breeds that will provide more options for organic producers and respond to both the challenges that you face today and the growing markets that you cater to. In particular, I am fighting to ensure that these public research investments are delivering research results that can be directly used by farmers to meet the challenges that you face now with solutions that you can use now. In Wisconsin, we are lucky to have innovators in sustainable agricultural systems. For many years, they have pioneered solutions to the challenges that face organic producers. I strongly support increased investments in sustainable agriculture research and extensions program because it provides funding to support this work, to address difficulties that new farmers face and help farmers innovate and share best practices. From sustainable agriculture systems and dynamic education for our beginning, farmers time and time again, Moses has brought together those who carry on our state's history of farming with great pride. I am proud to be your partner in the United States Senate as we continue to move together, to work together, to build a grown-in Wisconsin economy. I know you are not all from Wisconsin, but I have to say I am partial here and keep all of our rural communities growing and strong. I look forward to continuing our work together and I want to just again thank you so honestly and deeply for inviting me to join the conference today. I know there is only a few hours left, but please enjoy every second that remains. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Mr. President. It is no secret that we are living in a dangerous time, and we face a variety of threats to our security at home and abroad. We all agree that we need to make investments in a strong military to protect and defend our national security. We have also come together in agreement on the need to take on our national security challenges and our challenges here at home in a balanced way. The bipartisan budget agreement that we passed into law last year was far from perfect, but it provided much needed certainty for our economy by preventing the ongoing threats of a government default or a government shutdown. It restored investments in both our national and our economic security, ensuring that every dollar of investment in defense was matched by a dollar of investment in a stronger economy and a stronger middle class. A balanced approach has served us well. It was a necessary compromise grounded in fairness that should guide our bipartisan work going forward. I understand that the Chairman would like to give the Defense Department $18 billion more than they currently have from the American taxpayers. But I also know that the American people need stronger investments in the challenges that they face each and every day just trying to get ahead. If we're going to spend more on our military than it's only fair that we also invest more in education, in job training, and workforce readiness to raise incomes and create a stronger economy for all. If we're going to spend more on the Pentagon than it's only fair, we also invest more in putting people to work and rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and transportation and water infrastructure. I also know that we have unfinished business in the Congress to bolster our vulnerable cybersecurity infrastructure and to boost TSA security and to better support our law enforcement needs. We also have a responsibility to act on the public health crisis posed by Zika. We simply must do more and approve the necessary funding to prevent, detect, and respond to this serious and dangerous threat. And we need to provide relief to the people in Flint, Michigan who are still suffering from the impacts of lead contamination. I understand the military has asked for more helicopters and more fighter jets. But I also know that the American people need Washington to be stronger partners in the fights that we are confronting in communities across our country today. That's why I am pleased to support Senator Reid's amendment to invest $18 billion to help our middle class to keep our country safe and to respond to the Zika virus and lead contamination and heroin and opioids and the crisis that we are facing with drug abuse throughout our nation. As I have traveled Wisconsin, it is clear that we face an opioid and heroin epidemic. And I know that many of my colleagues here in the Senate face that same crisis in their home states. In Wisconsin, it is a big problem and it demands a bold response from Washington. We are in the midst of a crisis that is touching far too many across our state. I have heard stories from family members who have tragically lost loved ones to addiction. And I have heard from people who are on the path of recovery. At one of my community meetings in Pihuahki, a father came up to me to courageously share a story of tragically losing his youngest son to addiction a couple of years ago right after Christmas. And recently I heard from Leonard from Colfax, Wisconsin, whose grandson Nathan was killed in a car accident when he was just 16 years old. The driver of the other car was under the influence of heroin at the time. I have also heard from a mother from South Milwaukee whose son suffered from addiction for 20 years. While he is now in recovery at one point, she found him unconscious from a heroin overdose on their bathroom floor. Another mother from McWanago wrote to tell me that her own son's life was saved by paramedics who administered the drug naloxone during his overdose, allowing him to survive. The message is clear, families simply can't afford to wait any longer for help from Washington. It should not be easier for Wisconsinites to get their hands on opioids or heroin than it is for them to get treatment for their addiction. As we consider today increasing our spending for the military, let us not forget American law enforcement, first responders, health care providers, and citizens fighting on the front lines to combat our opioid and heroin crisis. Let us not forget those struggling to get sober and to stay healthy. As communities continue to confront this epidemic on a daily basis, Washington needs to step up and needs to be a strong partner with state and local and nonprofit efforts. The first place we can start is by making emergency investments for prevention, crisis intervention, treatment, and recovery efforts. I was proud to support by partisan legislation that provides this funding because these resources are vital as we continue to respond to this national emergency. Unfortunately, this funding was blocked by congressional Republicans. This epidemic knows no political party and it should be an issue that unites us all. We must do more because fighting this nationwide epidemic is a shared responsibility. Everyone has a role to play in addressing this crisis and Congress should be no exception. The communities we represent need the resources necessary to win this fight. I know from talking to people I work for in Wisconsin that the opioid and heroin epidemic is a problem that neither law enforcement nor the health care system can tackle alone. The federal government can't solve this problem by itself just as we can't expect state and local communities to address it by themselves. Together, we must continue our fight and rise to this challenge. Let's work together to help our communities recover from this epidemic and stay healthy. The Senate will soon vote on the red amendment. This amendment would provide $1.1 billion to respond to the opioid and heroin crisis. The amendment would invest a total of $18 billion, equal to the amount of funding that my Republican colleague, Chairman McCain, is proposing to spend on the Department of Defense. The vote is about fairness and priorities. I believe that if we are going to provide more funding to the Pentagon, we should also invest in our middle class. Ensure our security here at home and step up to the plate and provide the resources Americans need to respond to the serious emergencies that they face here at home. Mr. President, I yield back and I would suggest the absence of a quorum. The clerk called the roll. Mr. Alexander.",

        "transcript": " to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I'm going to give you a round of applause. I'm going to give you a round of applause. I'm going to give you a round of applause. Wow, what an incredible crowd. How's everybody doing today? We a little bit fired up. I see steel workers in the crowd. Are we a little bit fired up? I'd like to thank everybody, I'm Wisconsin's Democratic ticket for being here today. It's an honor to be on the same ballot as them. I'd also like to thank the Marquette College Democrats for hosting this and the UWM for the venue for this event. I'm so glad we get the opportunity to talk to all of you today, especially the younger voters, about the opportunity that we have coming up in November. Down the ticket, the choice is very clear. We can have elected officials that misrepresent who they are and what they stand for, or we can have honest, hardworking electives that will fight for everyday people for this great state. I mean on one hand you have Scott Walker. What's he running as? He's running as the education governor. But the first thing he did, I remember being a dad, was he gutted nearly a billion dollars from public education. And then you have Tony Hevers. Tony... Tony actually knows a little something about education. He's going to be a teacher. He's going to be our real education governor, and he's going to restore this state's education system to the world renowned status we want had. And let me touch briefly on Leah Vukmur. Here you have a nurse who supports gutting pre-existing conditions for everybody. You know, I have cancer. That's a pre-existing condition. That hits pretty close to home. You know, but Tammy Baldwin, she's going to fight to protect those pre-existing conditions. She's going to improve our healthcare, not destroy it. We need to keep Tammy exactly where she is. And a huge thank you to Senator Bernie Sanders. Bernie has supported our campaign since the beginning, which has honestly meant so much. We had a couple of events already, and I was thinking up to today, it's great having an event with Bernie, but today we actually have two events, one here and then one down in Kenosha. And I'll never forget 2016 when he was running for president. I was working on a Northwestern Mutual Tower downtown. I'm at lunchtime. I got a phone call from his campaign, and they asked me if I would speak at his rally when he's running for president. And I'm thinking, what kind of presidential candidate calls up a construction worker, eaten it out of his lunch box, to ask him to go speak at a rally? That really set him apart from other candidates for me. Not only that, not only that, but his campaign staff wanted to know if there was a picket line. If we had some kind of job action going on, because Bernie wanted to go walk a picket line, if workers here needed help. That tells you all you need to know about Senator Bernie Sanders. And he continues every single day to be a part of a working people. Both in his work every day as senator, fighting tirelessly for $15 an hour, and Medicare for all, and in his support from my campaign, and energizing Wisconsin voters to take back our state. And while I may have been active in Wisconsin politics for a few years, now mainly protesting like Act 10, and more recently for immigrants' rights, running for Congress really was not something I was ever on my bucket list. But when Paul Ryan was trying to take away our healthcare, my fellow ironworkers and I were talking on the job site about actually doing something for a change. He wanted to repeal and replace healthcare for 23 million Americans. We said, let's repeal and replace him. When I returned from my service in the Army, I worked two full-time jobs, and I didn't have health insurance. So when I was diagnosed with cancer, I had no way to cover the costs. The financial burden was insurmountable, and I had to declare bankruptcy because of my medical bills. I know that my story resonates with countless people because it's their story too. Soon after, I started an apprenticeship as an ironworker. And I'll work an iron, it's a tough job, but it was also that that would help me get out of debt, and that was my ticket to the middle class. It allowed me to provide for healthcare for my son. It gave us both good health insurance and allowed me entry into the middle class. But sadly, too many good-paying union jobs are being outsourced. Right here in Wisconsin, at home, and all across the country. That's why I'm here. That's why I keep fighting. For all of us. With your help and the help from people all across this country, we were able to repeal Paul Ryan. But make no mistake, his hand-picked replacement is just as bad as he is. His hand-picked replacement is a corporate attorney who has made his money outsourcing good-paying Wisconsin jobs. He's supported the tax scam, and he's not going to protect Medicare and Social Security. Bottom line, he's a corporate lawyer who doesn't know what it's like to fall on hard times. What it means to live in poverty, and how hard it is to make ends meet when his party keeps putting profits over people. Now my opponent refers to me as Radical Randy. My 12-year-old son thinks that's kind of cool. You know, but all things being said, I don't think it's radical to demand that everybody has access to healthcare. I don't think it's radical to demand that we protect good-paying American jobs, and we start exporting cars, not jobs. And I don't think it's too radical to believe we have to protect our environment because our kids and their kids are depending on it. It isn't radical to believe that we need to use our taxpayer money to give our kids better education, and how about paying public sector work is what they're worth. I definitely don't believe it's too radical that the people of the first congressional district expect more than what we've gotten for the past 20 years. We're all right! Together, we repeal Paul Ryan, but I need every single one of you to help me replace him. I know this November is for us, the hardworking people of Wisconsin, and now more than ever, it is important to stay involved and keep fighting. I want to thank you all so much for being here. Just remember, after Election Day, there's not going to be any phone calls to call people for help. We need to win this November. Next, I have a great privilege to introduce the next speaker, my friend Mandela Barnes. Mandela was one of the few early endorsements that we endorsed each other, and it was easy. It was an easy thing to do. Since being elected State Representative, I remember seeing him beating the Sun up at the crack of dawn to go stand up on behalf of Walmart workers to make sure that they would get $15 an hour. It was a very cold day too. He wasn't there for any kind of a show. This man, he definitely walks the talk. And he continues to prove the strength of his character and leadership. From the first time I met Mandela, I knew he would make a difference in our state. And he definitely has not let me down. With that, our next Lieutenant Governor, Mandela Barnes. So we have a thing, Randy Bryce. Think about how privileged we are to have Randy Bryce right here in the state of Wisconsin. It will be a wonderful day when we return government back to working people, where it belongs. Right where it belongs. So I am Mandela Barnes and I am your Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor. I am proud to be here to bring you one message. And that message that Tony Evers will be elected, the next governor of the state of Wisconsin, on November 6th. And you don't have to look much further than rooms like this to know that people are frustrated and tired of eight years of divide and conquer under Governor Scott Walker. Unfortunately, people have not seen any wage increases. Our environment has been disregarded. Our schools have been defunded. That was then, this is now. And that is why we are running this race across the entire state. We are not just campaigning in every county. But we are making sure that we show up in every community. To make sure that people are heard. To make sure that the voices of people who have been forgotten who have been left behind by government will no longer be forgotten. And they will be heard in the Evers Barnes administration. So I say all this to say that I know people look at Tony Evers and myself and they look at those two young guys. Just getting across the state, campaigning and having a great time doing Facebook Live videos. But it is so much more than that. And we know that this campaign won't just be about everything that Governor Walker has done wrong. We only have 15 days. It is just not enough to talk about all the things that are wrong. This campaign is about restoring hope and opportunity to everybody in this state. It is about making sure that we provide access to quality and affordable health care. It means that we take the Medicaid expansion on the first day in office. It means that we work to create a badger care public option so that we can have health care for all for everybody in the state of Wisconsin. And as Randy said before me is a cancer survivor. Tony Evers is also a cancer survivor. He be cancer and he will be Scott Walker. And if I could just take a moment to go back to the revisit the two young guys statement. It is pretty funny. Today we are going to have two guys with gray hair and glasses. They are going to get us all fired up and people feel the burn. We are going to feel the tone. We are going to feel the tone. And the tone feels like change. Change is in the air for the state of Wisconsin. Also like to throw in the point that Tony Evers and our average age is 48 and a half years old. So it works out. But it has been such a fantastic time getting across talking to people because we want to make sure again that Wisconsin is open for everyone. Not just open for business regardless of how you identify, regardless of your immigration status regardless if you have a criminal record or not. You deserve a chance to get ahead in the state of Wisconsin. But the only way that we create that Wisconsin that is open for all is when we show up to vote. And I know that everybody in this room plans to vote. And this election is so important and that is why they are putting up so many hurdles, so many barriers to prevent people from voting. And that is why I say we are going to vote in spite of. We are going to vote because they don't want us to vote. And not only are we going to vote, we are going to take people to vote with us. We are going to make sure that not just our friends, our family members and our neighbors know about this election. We are going to make sure strangers know about this election. Because we have to talk to the people that we don't know. We have to talk to the people that don't know us. We have to talk to the people who are the most impacted by Governor Walker's disastrous policies. And I can go on, I have talked about the need to expand health care and also to fully fund our schools. And Governor Walker, again, Randy Bryce talked about it. Governor Walker is no friend of public education. If you remember, we just cut $250 million from the UW system. At the same time they are talking about building new prisons. Now we spend a billion and a half dollars to lock people up. We spend a billion and a half dollars to lock people up in the state of Wisconsin. That is more than we spend on the entire UW system. This is a priority's mismatch. And we have to make Wisconsin a state that prioritizes education not incarceration. We have to make Wisconsin a state that makes higher education affordable and accessible for everyone. If you are dealing with student loan debt or you know that you will be dealing with student loan debt, you should be able to refinance those loans. We should be able to borrow money at the same rate that big banks get to borrow money in this country. And we have to protect our environment. That is why we have made a commitment to put Wisconsin on track to be power 100% by renewable energy. And not only is it right for our environment, it is right for our economy. Because Wisconsin is lagging the nation. We trail behind our Midwest partners. We trail behind most states and economic growth. And on top of all that we have one more concept. It is a little far out there. So sit with me for a second. Tony and I, we think that we should probably get scientists back into the Department of Natural Resources. Because we all know that clean air and safe drinking water is a human right. And so I've given us the charge to go out there to make sure that we vote. We know how important it is. I said we vote because they don't want us to vote. And people will tell you about the fact that so many have lost their lives for the right for us to vote. But there are so many people who are dying for the right to vote. So not only do we need to vote because they don't want us to. We need to vote for someone who can't vote. That means we need to vote for that person with a criminal record who has had their rights taken away. That means we need to vote for our undocumented brothers and sisters. That means we have to vote for the school children who want to live in America that's free from gun violence. Now, we know that we cannot do this on our own. And on November 6th people will make a choice. The decision will be which direction do we want the state of Wisconsin to go ahead in. I'm choosing the path of opportunity. I hope that you all will choose that path with me. And we will go on this path together to make sure that we change the way that the state of Wisconsin looks. That we make sure that Wisconsin regardless of your zip code that you have a chance to get ahead. I'm so honored to be on this path. But I'm also honored to be joined by people who got on this path before me. People who have served as an inspiration. People who in spite of decided to go forward. People who were told know that there's no place for you in politics. People who didn't see themselves represented in state government and federal government but decided to go on that path anyway. I am so honored to be represented by my member of Congress. I think we all should be proud to be represented by Congresswoman Glamour. She is a trailblazer. She is a record breaker. And she is a different maker in the state of Wisconsin. Not only did Congresswoman Gwinn more make history, Congresswoman Gwinn more made a difference. And that's what's important. She fights for all of us. There is no stronger champion. I am so proud to call you. I'm so proud to introduce you to the rest of the world. I'm so proud to introduce all of you to her and you to all of you. I have problems finishing speeches. But we are going to make this thing work out. Congresswoman Gwinn more everybody. Oh my goodness. Well, they keep telling me to be strong. But it's just too hard. I'm so proud to be represented by my member of Congresswoman Gwinn more. I'm so proud to be represented by my member of Congresswoman Gwinn more. I'm so proud to be represented by my member of Congresswoman Gwinn more. But it's just too hard to get along. I got the Scott Kevin Walker Blue. I want to tell you something. You've heard all the issues up here. I have known Scott Walker since 1990. When he first ran against me in the state assembly and lost. But you know how germs are. If you don't kill all the germs right away, they just double down and come back. And he came back and he became, I mean, he put in legislation. He put in legislation to make sure that we had private prisons, even put juveniles in the private prison. Mandela, am I wrong about this? Right. I mean, he had shared the same thing with the state. He put in legislation to make sure that we had private prisons, even put juveniles in the private prison. He had champagne celebrations for private prisons and juveniles in them, middle-eal people into prisons. I'm just going to give you a little history here. I'm not going to be long because I know you waiting for some headliners here. But I'm just going to give you a little history. And then he went on. He became governor. He closed down. Planned parenthood clinics for women. He cut homestead tax credits for the elderly. He cut tens of thousands of people out of health care. He's leading the charge and fighting against, including pre-existing conditions in part of normal health care. I could go on and on and on. Lord, have mercy. They keep telling me to be strong. They keep telling me I'm wrong. But I got the skippin, Scott Kevin Walker blues. And nothing I can do about it. Except I got a solution, y'all. Somebody who would cut education, it sounds to me like we need an educator in the state cap. Somebody who gave us a $250 million deficit, the minute that he didn't take that Medicaid expansion, seems like we need somebody who's been in the classroom and know that 2 plus 2 equals 4. Seems like we need somebody like that. Ladies and gentlemen, young people, millennials, really, I want to talk to you for a second. It's really in your hands. It really is. And I know, listen, I'm going to talk to you. Because I know y'all are mad at us. It's some of us boomers. Yeah, come on, tell them the truth. How many of y'all mad at us? You mad at us because we have left you with nothing but a mess. But guess what, you're the solution now. You're the biggest cohort of voters out there. And it's really in your hands. And no matter what our differences are, we can come together around a few things. Now, some say Evers, some say Evers. But all of us say Scott Walker re-elected never. Evers, Evers, Scott Walker leave us. We all looking forward, up and down the ticket, vote for me while y'all are there, okay? Up and down the ticket. We're looking for people who are going to do with Martin Luther King. Junior says they're going to do justice. And we have an outstanding candidate for governor. Gonna be our next governor of the great state of Wisconsin. Tony Evers, ladies and gentlemen. Now, as you look at us, as you look at us, you see we have a lot in common. But we are going to look ever much the same on that great getting up morning of November 6th. And Tony, can you tell them the similarity that is so obvious, it will be so obvious on that great getting up morning between me and you. We're both winning. We're both beat Scott Walker. Good morning, everybody. I've been in this room several times as a member of the Board of Regents. We're as part of my job. And I've never seen a crowd like this. So after I get to point New Board of Regents members, I want all of you to come to that first meeting. It's outstanding to be here and thank you Gwen, trailblazer, and just an honor to be in the stage with her. And Mandela Birens will be the greatest Lieutenant Governor, you bet you. So I had a debate with Walker last week and I had the pleasure of asking him this question. So how's it feel to have like three of your most trusted advisors, four of them. Yes, four of your most trusted advisors say that you are unfit to be governor. We're going to make that happen on November 6th. I'm going to be the next governor of this state of Wisconsin. And as Mandela said, this campaign is all about Wisconsin values. And let's just talk about education for a minute. Scott Walker took $800 million out of our education system, $250 million out of higher education system. Making it, I just saw the other day, 15% fewer faculty at UWM, which is going to cause fewer courses, which is going to cause students to take longer to graduate. It's a downward spiral. We're going to change that going forward. We're going to fund education in the state of Wisconsin period. Also have to make sure that we understand that low wage walker has brought us low wages in the state of Wisconsin. We're going to $15 an hour minimum. And we're going to give every middle class family in the state of Wisconsin a 10% break on their income taxes. Because those are the people that have been struggling all along under Scott Walker. You think about how our tax system works. Think about that. Scott Walker has not funded public schools. What happens as a result? The people of Wisconsin love their public schools. They go to referendum. They decided to raise their own taxes on themselves to support those public schools. That's a Scott Walker tax increase right there. And you know that our pot holes are now called Scott holes. Whether it's Scott holes or whether it's people in northern Wisconsin having a strip to asphalt off the gravel. That doesn't work here in the state. We have to change things going forward. We have to have a transportation plan that supports not only our roads, but also mass transit. And sooner or later we have to get trains running in this state. A little story about health care. Scott Walker, as you may remember, ran for president. He wasn't around much. But as a result of him running for president, he had to be against the Affordable Care Act, and he's meant that he would not take the money from Washington DC, the Medicaid money. Think about that. He took that money or took ran for president, spent $30 million running for president, got 0.5% of the vote. And then as a result, people in Wisconsin have to pay more health insurance than they do in Minnesota. Our pre-existing conditions, protections, our out-of-the-window. His running for president caused people in Wisconsin to suffer. We're going to change that, and we're going to take that Medicaid money first day. I heard Randy before talking about pre-existing conditions, and I have one myself. I'm a cancer survivor, and I couldn't imagine what it would have been like fighting through that if I didn't have health insurance. There's millions of people in the state of Wisconsin, 2.4 million people that have pre-existing conditions. Scott Walker just today said, that's doubled down on that today. They are in federal court to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which would get rid of pre-existing conditions. On TV this morning, he doubled down. He said, it's absolutely the right thing to do. Under my administration, we will always have those protections for pre-existing conditions. Now the last thing I want to quickly talk about is criminal justice reform. State of Wisconsin is one of the worst in the country, in some places worse than the world. If you look like me and you commit a crime, and that same exact crime was committed by a person of color, odds are that person is going to be in jail, and I'm not. That is wrong. That is wrong. We have to be smart on crime, not dumb on crime. We can change this going forward. This is an issue. We spend more on corrections than we do in the University of Wisconsin system. You think about that. We need to make sure that we have opportunities for people to be rehabilitated. It's cheaper, gets people back in the workforce, and back to their families. We can't have people rotting in prison with nothing looking forward to happening in their lives. That is this wrong, and we're going to change this in the state of Wisconsin. Now, here's a deal. You all know this. When Democrats vote, Democrats win. Mandela and I are chasing all over the state of Wisconsin, talking to people, building relationships with people. That's what counts. I remember that from the classroom. The most important thing you do is build relationships with those kids. We have to build relationships with every voter. We can't do it ourselves. It's about getting people out to vote, making sure you reach out to your friends and relatives. Vote early. We are going to win this November. We need your help. We're going to do it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. My name is Sola Littlejohn. I'm a fast food worker and a leader in the fight for 15. Thank you. Thank you. I'm extremely inspired to be here today. I'm truly proud to be a participant in this rally. I'm truly proud to be surrounded by so many positive people, including elected officials and candidates who support workers like me and you. I'm almost speechless. Thank you. I'm definitely going to use this time and this opportunity to use my voice. I would like to start off by saying on behalf of the fight for 15 brothers and sisters that we truly appreciate seeing good pro-worker, pro-union politicians, we glad to see they exist and that we stand here with them today. Thank you. Less than three weeks ago, thousands of fast food workers across America went on strike to demand unions for all and a $15 living wage for all. And we had a great turnout of support from those politicians who were willing to stand with us and willing to risk a rest as well. And it's about standing for something better. It's about fighting for good jobs and equality in life, improved working conditions, a decent shot at a future for ourselves and our families. It doesn't make sense that we work for a billion dollar global corporations that pay wages so low workers like me are forced to rely on government assistance and can barely afford simple living necessities. And that's just not living to stop surviving. These corporations we work for need to be held accountable and we, well they have the power and the money to pay us better and let us organize and build the unions we so much desperately need. With the union, we wouldn't have to demand a living wage. We'd have healthcare and savings. We'd have sick days and paid vacation days. The bottom line is we'd be protected by unions. Now, we've even seen in the mass agreement that workers have won a buckstile agreement for a $15 wage, floor and union rights. And we fast food workers are asking for the same to be done for fast food corporations all around the country. But we're not just asking this from greedy corporations. We're also asking this from self interest, anti-worker, anti-union politicians as well. We asked to be heard for what we failed they don't understand us nor do they really care. How many families in Wisconsin are living in poverty while the rest of Wisconsin is falling behind? The same, the same workers who are living in poverty and struggling like me to pay bills are the same ones who have the strongest voting power to elect candidates into office. Two weeks from now, we will be casting our votes at these polls. We plan to show our political power on November 6th. And yes, we need elected officials who are about workers, who care about unions, who care about the state of the state and the people in the state. From now until election day, we'll be cabinsing neighborhoods, communities, Wisconsinites, we'll be cabinsing communities and neighborhoods where Wisconsinites have been left out of the voting process. 515 will do whatever it takes to win. Yes. And if that means going on strike, knocking on doors, cabinsing, and encouraging people to register and vote, then that's just what we're going to do. Of course, Senator Bernie Sanders said no one in America, especially working for profitable corporations, should be living in poverty. And I think that's right. Because it is 2018, and I honestly cannot think of a job that should not start at $15 an hour or more. It should not give you the right to unionize. And I will end by saying this, that we, the workers, need to be heard, and I will say this, that we, the workers, we may not run America, but we make America run. Again, my name is Sarah Littlejohn, thank you. Peter Rickman, president of Milwaukee, A.S. and House of County Workers Union. My name is Peter Rickman, and I am here for a political revolution. In 2016, Bernie Sanders demonstrated that political leadership in this country can rise because, not despite, but because it champions the demands of social movements, because it fights for working class people instead of cow-towing to billionaire class interests. Bernie Sanders popularized the notion that in the richest country, in the history of the world, every single working person deserves a living wage by right. Not as a privilege, but a right here in this American nation. Biggest economy in the world, we can pay everyone a living wage. We needed a political revolution to define that all workers deserve living wages and union rights. Because the truth is, in America, the bus class has rigged the system. They've taken over our economy. They've busted our unions. They've destroyed our wage laws. It's why our paychecks are too damn small. Corporate profits are too damn high. Bernie said, how low we've had enough, and people are marching in this political revolution. It's time we unrigged this system. And it's a political revolution that's going to do it. I want to tell you sisters and brothers, this is not just an idea or a dream. It is a reality. Two years ago, right here in Milwaukee, right in Walker's Wisconsin, when the fight for 15 and a union and the political revolution came together. We were able to win the first agreement of its kind anywhere in the country, right here for 15 and a union, for thousands of workers, right here in downtown Milwaukee. That's what a political revolution looks like. Don't tell me we cannot win. We are winning right here. The single bomb working two jobs as a cook, the recent college grad who's bartending to pay off the student loan debt, the recent immigrant who's a hotel housekeeper. They're the ones who need this political revolution, and they're the very same people who know that for a political revolution to occur, we must make it. It's with our own two hands. And that's why they are the people who are building this fight for 15 and a union, not just talking about it, not just in their workplace, but like Solos said, out in the streets and in the neighborhoods knocking on doors. To get folks out to vote on November 6th, to vote for living wages, to vote for union rights for everybody, to vote for a political revolution, to vote for an economy for the many not the few. We're going to mobilize hundreds of thousands of people. The margin of defeat, the margin of despair in 2016 was only 22,000 votes. We can get out 100,000, 200,000, more working class people who say it's time for a political revolution, it's time to unregister system, it's time to build this economy, it's time for us to rise. We are the ones who will do it, we will build this political revolution, we will make this road by walking ourselves, it is no one but us. Now I want you, I don't have much time up here, I want you to just close your eyes and imagine here, just one moment, I want you to think about the night of November 6th, what it's going to be like, what will that story be on CNN, on MSNBC, maybe even on Fox News? And it ain't going to be a blue way sisters and brothers, it's going to be a rising tide of political revolution. I want you to imagine what is the story going to be when right here in Walker's Wisconsin, where they made sport of busting our unions, where they cut our wages, simply to put more profits in the hands of the billionaire class, right here in Wisconsin. The story will be, the political revolution took flight, it's sent to Congress to stand with Senator Bernie Sanders in the fight for 15 and a union for all, Senator Tammy Baldwin, the story is going to be that the state that thrice elected, Scott Walker that put Donald Trump in the White House and sent in Ron Johnson is going to turn around, it's going to turn around by putting Tony Evers in our capital to deliver on 15 and a union for every single man and woman in this state who works for a living, the story will be, the turnaround of this country beginning right here in Wisconsin, what happens in Wisconsin does not stay in Wisconsin. But it will not be, that story will not come to be on CNN or MSMBC, sure as hell not on Fox News unless each and every one of us takes up this mantle and we have a choice sisters and brothers vote on November 6th but do nothing more, do nothing and let the boss class continue to hold us down, let them keep their power. And good luck with all that, we'll see where this economy goes, it ain't going to be working for us, it'll work for the few not the many, the other choice your sisters and brothers and if you are with me, I need you to get with me here today and get out into these streets. The other choice is that we go and make this political revolution ourselves with our hands and our feet so that on November 6th we win back our state and we do not stop there and we march and fight and win 15 and a union for all. And economy for the many not the few, that's a political revolution sisters and brothers, it's all of you, it's not who's up here, it's out there. Now if you believe that we can win, I want you to put your hand up, stand up and be counted, if you believe in living wages for all workers, if you believe in unions, I want you to say it with me, I want you to repeat after me sisters and brothers, I believe that we win. I believe that we win, turn up, I believe that we win, I believe that we win. I believe that we win. I believe that we win. Reject the Andrews director from Milwaukee, Jake Spence. Thank you. Good morning everybody, my name is Jake Spence, I'm the regional organizing director here in Milwaukee County for the Democratic Party Coordinated Campaign. I just want to thank all of you for being here today. I also want to say it really is incredible to see so many familiar and new faces out in the crowd, it's really great to have you all here. And I'm so proud that we are all in this together to reelect Senator Tammy Baldwin to the United States Senate and to help elect all the other Democrats up and down the ticket. Now I was born here in Milwaukee, born and raised and I've lived here nearly my whole life. My mom was a special education teacher here in Milwaukee for over 30 years. And my father served on the school board for almost 15 years. So I love our city. And here in Milwaukee what I love about it is that we help each other out and we help each other succeed. And that's exactly what Senator Tammy Baldwin is all about. Tammy is fighting to protect our health care, to lower costs. And she does right by Wisconsin no matter what it takes and no matter what powerful special interests stand in the way. And it's exactly why those special interests have spent over $14 million just to try to beat her. Now this election could come down to a couple thousand votes. And the work that we all do, it's going to be the difference between winning and losing for Tammy and for all the other Democrats. So that's why I'm going to tell you that it's important to have those face-to-face conversations with your family, your friends, and your neighbors about the issues that they care about most. And make sure that they all know that this is absolutely vital. So if you haven't already done so, please sign up for a shift. There are folks in the room with clipboards. They'll be folks outside with clipboards. Please take a minute, talk to them, and sign up for a shift to help out. Not only is it fun and it's easy, but we also need your help as thousands of other Wisconsinites across the state are helping to talk to voters here. So before I leave today, I also want to make sure that you all remember to vote. Right? You know, we know that we can't let the special interests silence our voices and the easiest way to make our voices heard and to speak out is by showing up at the polls. And the great thing is that you actually don't have to wait until November 6th to vote. You can vote today. Right? So all you need to do is bring your photo ID to a polling location. And you can find where and when to vote by going to www.tamibaldwin.com slash early vote and check out your polling location there. And if you are a resident of the city of Milwaukee, you don't even have to do that. You can walk over to UWM's very own Peck School of the Arts and vote right after the rally today. So I just want to let you guys all know that Tammy has had our backs for the last six years. And it's time for us to make sure that she gets reelected this year. So sign up to vote. Sign up to volunteer. Get out to vote. Thanks again for being here today. So well done. So well done. So so please welcome the state center and president of all revolution need a turner. So I just want to know I got something to tell you now this is breaking news. Only all that we love is on the line. That's all. And that is why not only this November is important but every November after this because only all that we love is on the line. I heard my brother before me a couple of speakers before me talk about how the system is rigged. I'm going to a man that the system is rigged. It is rigged politically. It is rigged socially. It is rigged economically. It has been rigged on purpose. But just as it has been rigged on purpose we the people can unrigged on purpose Milwaukee. Are you with me? Because only all that we love is on the line. And I want you to understand this see this is not just about electing great elected officials. I'm a part of that equation Congresswoman Gwen Moore I got to shout my sister out. But this really is about we the people it is about us as our indigenous sisters and brothers put it we must be willing to see seven generations beyond our sense. Because only all that we love is on the line. Or as one brother put it we must be willing to plant trees who shade we may never enjoy Milwaukee only all that we love is on the line. And so we have some folks Milwaukee and I'm not talking about the folks who are here today but we do have some folks in elected office who once they got there they lost they have a love of minds. And so it is imperative it is important that we we us you us all of us are willing to put something on this. To make this world a better place. And so Milwaukee only all that we love is on the line. So now you've heard the talk about raising the minimum wage I don't know about you but I don't know very many folks who say the following when I grow up I want to be poor. Nobody wants to be poor. But we have a system that benefits the upper echelons at the expense of the rest of us and that is not right and we the people must change it on purpose only all that we love. It is on the line. And to my sisters. It is about us controlling all of this. But it's not just about that we care about our whole damn dollar let's say hold down dollar. We want to hold down dollar. It is about making sure that our communities are safe. It is about making sure that we have a criminal justice system that is just for all people black and brown and white and red and yellow. Only all that we love is on the line. That's all. Now I bring you word from our sisters and brothers in Indiana with a senator and I were from Michigan, from South Carolina, from Iowa, from North Carolina. And guess what Wisconsin they feel the same way that you do that we must continue to push forward to create the type of future that we want to see because only all that we love is on the line. That's all. So it's on us. So Milwaukee titles are good. They real good. They get your phone calls return titles are good but purpose is better. And we need more purpose driven people from the local level all the way to the federal level who understand that the power that they hold belongs to the people it belongs to you and it belongs to you and it belongs to you. So three things Milwaukee. Just three. Just three. I believe that the creator of this magnificent universe has given us two hands. One to reach forward and one to reach back lifting as we climb. We are our sisters and our brothers keep us. We are. And most importantly we cannot ask other folks to do more for us than we are willing to do for ourselves. As brother Frederick Douglass put it you might not get everything that you work for but you will indeed work for everything that you get in order for us to transcend and transform this nation. And it's up to us because only all that we love is on the line. That's all. So in the words. I want to say one of my heroes who sacrificed and put it all on the line. I want you to go with me in your mind and follow sister Harriet Tubman. She is important and informing this movement of humanity because even when she got her freedom she went back to saying some other folks how many of you are willing to go back and say somebody else. And she said these words. Milwaukee I need them to get deep down into your soul into your heart. She said these words. She said if you hit a dog's barking. Keep going. And if you see the torches in the woods keep going. If there is shouting after you keep going. If you want to taste the freedom don't ever stop keep going. So Milwaukee. If we won't Medicare for all we must. If we believe that education for all of our children from the womb to the tomb we must. And if we believe that the work of day people in this country deserve a good life we must. Oh my god and if we want to transcend this country we must. We must. And if we want to keep going and thinking about keeping going to continue to go to move forward I couldn't think of a better person than the senator that you have here in this state senator Tammy Baldwin. She has shared her story. See health care for all for her is personal. And she has shared her story all across this state all across this country. Health care sisters and brothers is personal. And she has continued to stand up for the working class people in this state and making a statement about how it is important to use the power that we have to lift. She is the one. And so she does understand that the mission that we all have is so how we can get over it. And the mission is so low we can't get under. And the mission is so wide we cannot get around it. That's what you have in senator Tammy Baldwin. So if you believe in her leadership if you understand we must support her and continue to have her in that senate speaking show enough truth to power I want you to give it up for senator Tammy Baldwin. Thank you all. Thank you Nina Turner for that wonderful introduction. You look beautiful. It's great to be back here in Milwaukee. We have heard from some incredible speakers so far who have talked about the stakes that Wisconsinites face. Wisconsin deserves leaders as governor and lieutenant governor who will put Wisconsin families first. And those leaders are Tony Evers and Mandela Barnes. I know that together Tony and Mandela will fight for affordable health care fix our crumbling roads and fully fund education from early childhood through college. And I am so proud to be joined today by my friend senator Bernie Sanders. Yeah. Bernie is a fearless fighter for hard working families. And I couldn't ask for a better partner in the United States senate and standing up to the powerful special interests. Whether it's fighting for affordable health care for all. Whether it's standing up for workers and pensions. Whether it's holding Wall Street and banks accountable. Or pushing for college affordability and reforms and taking on student loan debt. Bernie knows what the stakes are this November. Now look Washington is a mess. It's a total mess right now. From the cable news shout fest to the early morning tweet storms or what did he tweet this morning to the nasty attack ads. And when Washington isn't working, it means it's not working for Wisconsin. For you, your families or your communities. And that's why I'm working so hard to put Wisconsin first. But I'll tell you this. Washington is working for some. Washington is working pretty well for one group of folks. The powerful special interests. Time and time again, they call the shots to keep the system literally rigged in their favor. And to think they've now got their bought and paid for a candidate in this election, my opponent, Leah Boothmeer. So let's just take health care, for example. Time after time, my opponent has backed efforts to gut protections for Wisconsinites with pre-existing health conditions. And frankly, if my opponent had been in the United States Senate last year, we would have seen her be the deciding vote to take people's health care away. But that's not all. Over her 16-year record as a politician in Wisconsin, she has consistently stood with the big insurance companies. She even opposed a bill that required insurance coverage for oral chemotherapy. Now, who does that? I was not sent to Washington to take people's health care away. That's right. And I believe that every Wisconsinite deserves affordable high quality health care. And this fight, many of you know, this fight is personal for me. When I was a child, I had a very serious childhood illness at age 9. I was in the hospital for three months. And my grandparents who raised me, found out that their insurance family insurance coverage didn't cover a grandchild. You know, in the fine print, I wasn't a legal dependent. This happens throughout our nation. But you know, after I recovered, they said, let's fix this. Let's get her insurance that we know will cover her. Well, I'll tell you, I wasn't a very attractive candidate for insurance after three months in the hospital because I had this label, child with a pre-existing health condition. You know, it's why I entered public service and why I fought so hard to make sure that no one is ever again denied coverage because of a pre-existing health condition. And I pushed, I pushed to make sure that young people could stay on their parents' health insurance until they're 26 years old. And now millions more young people have insurance coverage. You know, health care is on the ballot this year. And we can't let my opponent and her special interest friends take our health care away from us. That's right. But let's also look at another issue. That tax plan that special corporate interest pushed through Congress last year. You know, my opponent backed that plan where 83% of the benefits go to the top 1% of individuals and large multinational corporations on the corporate side. You know, it benefited companies like Exxon and Wells Fargo and drug manufacturers like Pfizer as if they weren't already having massive enough profits. So you know, one company, one corporation, Exxon Mobile will get a bigger tax break in the first year of this tax plan than every Wisconsin individual and family combined. It makes no sense. Frankly, if that tax plan had of sent 83% of its benefits to hardworking families and middle class families, it would have gotten my vote. But instead, my opponent only wants to reward her corporate interest friends. She wants to pay for this new tax law. Get this by putting social security and Medicare and Medicaid on the table. And that's the difference. That's the choice that voters face this year. My opponent has sold out to Wisconsin and national corporate special interests. She does their bidding. Meanwhile, I will stand up to anyone, whatever the cost to do right by Wisconsin. And... But we have... We have a job to do. We can't let my opponent and her special interests backers run roughshod over Wisconsin. We need to rise up and speak out and demand that Washington starts working for Wisconsin. And I need you all. I need you all to be engaged in the remaining days of this fight. Each and every one of you can and will make a difference. And it's going to take all of us. Powerful special interests have sunk millions of dollars trying to defeat me here in Wisconsin. Over $14 million to date. But I have something that they don't. And that's all of you. That's all of you. So... We saw... We saw in the health care fight the impact that you can have. You own that win. And that's what it's going to take to win this election. It's up to all of us to speak out. It's up to all of us to stand up. And it's up to all of us to vote. You have no need to wait until November 6th to cast your vote. And if you live in Milwaukee County, pull out your phones right now. And type in www.tammybaldwin.com slash early vote. And that's going to bring you to a site that tells you where you can early vote. And when you can early vote. And including the fact that one of those early vote sites is right across the street. Which gives you no excuse not to love this rally and then go out and early vote. Now look, this is so critically important. Because while there are names of candidates on the ballot, there are also deeply personal issues on the ballot. Health care is on the ballot. Pensions are on the ballot. Climate change is on the ballot. Net neutrality is on the ballot. Equality is on the ballot. And I am so grateful. I want to remind you again that, yeah, those special interests have millions of dollars, millions of millions of dollars. But you, you are the ones who are going to decide. I have the distinct honor of bringing you my friend and my colleague in the United States Senate. Please welcome Senator Bernie Sanders. Thank you. Thank you. Whoa. You know, if I were a Republican looking out in this crowd, I would be very nervous. Today we are here for some very serious business. And that serious business is re-electing my good friend, my colleague Tammy Baldwin back to the US Senate. To tell Scott Walker, it is time for him to depart. And to elect Tony Evers as governor. To elect Mandela Bonds as Lieutenant Governor. To elect Randy Bryce as the congressman from the first congressional district. And to send my old friend, when more, back to Congress for another term. Now, let me give you a brief history of US politics in recent years. Because it ain't complicated. Four years ago in the United States of America in our midterm elections, we had the lowest voter turnout since World War II. All right. Almost two out of three Americans did not vote. And the Koch brothers and the other billionaires spent an enormous amount of money. Put money on TV running ugly ads against candidates like Tammy and others. And people saying, it's a midterm election. I don't have to vote. And they stayed home. And working people stayed home. For income people stayed home. People of color stayed home. Young people stayed home. Not this time is exactly right. And people stayed home. And right wing Republicans won sweeping victories all across this country. And the result is we now have right wing leadership in the House of Representatives led by your very own Paul Ryan. You know Paul. And in the Senate by Mitch McConnell. And that is what happens when people don't vote. In this election 2018, we have learned our lesson. We're not going to have the lowest midterm voter turnout in history. We are going to have the highest voter turnout. And I want to say this is a wonderful turnout. I see people of all ages here. But I want to say a special word to the young people. I want to say to the young people, no offense to those of us who are older. The young generation in America today is the most progressive generation in the history of this country. Your generation is the least sexist, the least racist, the least homophobic, the least bigoted generation in the history of America. And your generation cares deeply about the health of the planet and climate change. But all of that decency, all of that love, all of that concern doesn't mean anything if you don't come out to vote. And mock my words on this. If the younger generation, people on the 30 vote at the same level as the rest of the population, you will transform the United States of America. So what Tammy and Nina and everybody else, what we are asking of you, is not only to come out and vote, not only to do early voting, but do something else. And I know it may be a little bit uncomfortable, but we are living in uncomfortable times. And we got to do sometimes things that make us a little bit nervous. And that is what we have. I think we have well over 1,000 people here. It's a great turnout. And that means a thousand votes for Tammy and the other great candidates. But if each and every one of you goes out of your way and starts talking to family members and co-workers and to your neighbors and you say, you know what? I know you don't usually vote, but this election is so very important. Come on out with me. I'll walk you to the polls. In fact, I'll even cook dinner for you on election night. And if each of you do that, that 1,000 votes that I hear this afternoon suddenly becomes 4,000 votes. And let me say something about voting turnouts and democracy. And that is, you know, Tammy has run for office and been around the wild and I've been around the wild. And this is what I honestly believe. And I come from Montenegro, run for office and I have lost elections and I've won elections. But it has never, ever occurred to me to make it harder for people to vote to suppress the vote because they might vote against me. Tammy and I have conservative friends and we debate the issues. So that's fine. That's American democracy. But what is not American democracy is to do what they're doing in Georgia, to do what they're doing in North Dakota. And to in fact do what they have done in this great state over the last 10 years and that it's making harder for people to vote. And I mean this seriously. Okay, I've been in a million debates and in a million campaigns. And if candidates, if my Republican friends out there don't have the guts to defend their ideas, if the only way they think they can win elections is by suppressing the vote and making it harder for people to vote, I say to them, get out of politics and get another job. Thank you. No, no, no, no, it ain't Bernie, it is you. You are going to transform this state and you are going to transform America. And of course as you have heard me say a million times real change, not going to come from Tammy, not going to come from me, it is going to come from you, it is going to come from grassroots America. Now I am more than painfully aware that Wisconsin in the general election voted for Donald Trump, I am small margin. But I have the strong feeling that a lot of people who voted for Trump in 2016 did not know that he was a pathological liar, that he would say one thing and then do the very opposite. When Trump ran for office, some of you may recall that he told the people of Wisconsin in Vermont in America that he was going to provide health care to everybody. You remember that? Health care everybody is what he said, but when he became president, he helped lead the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw 32 million Americans off of the health care that they have. Now I want you to think about just think for one second what it would have happened if by one vote Tammy and I had not helped defeat that horrible proposal. Think about your friends, think about your friends and family members who are dealing with cancer, dealing with heart disease, dealing with diabetes, who suddenly would have lost their lifeline and their insurance. And think about how much suffering and death would have occurred. So you got a president who told people of Wisconsin, health care for everybody, but he did exactly the opposite. You have a candidate in Donald Trump when he ran for office, he said, what was right? He said, we are going to take on the pharmaceutical industry. We are going to take on the drug companies. Two years have come and gone and drug prices today are soaring and higher than they have ever been. Donald Trump said he would take on the drug companies, but he lied. During his campaign, Donald Trump said I am a different type of Republican. Paul Ryan actually, he mentioned, Paul correctly wants the cut social security Medicare and Medicaid. Not Donald Trump, I won't do that. And I say to the people of Wisconsin who voted for Trump, he lied to you because in his last budget, he proposed a trillion dollar cut to Medicaid, 500 billion dollar cut to Medicare and a 72 billion dollar cut to the social security disability fund. Just a few weeks ago, and we don't have the time to catalog all of Trump's lives, we'd be here day and night, day and night. But just a week ago, Trump gets in front of, I think it was 60 minutes and he says, you know what, there are differences of opinion about climate change. Now there are not differences of opinion. The scientific community is virtually united in telling us that climate change is real. That it is caused by human activity, that it is already causing devastating harm in this country and around the world, and this is what they also said. They said, and that is the intergovernmental panel on climate change, and it's difficult to cut carbon emissions or this planet will suffer irreparable harm for our kids and our grandchildren. And in the White House, we have a president who is working hand in glove with the fossil fuel industry more concerned about their short-term profits than the future of our planet and the health of our children. During the presidential campaign, Trump said, I am going to take on World Street and I'm going to take on the establishment, but Trump ended up appointing more billionaires, more billionaires to his administration than any other country. And I'm going to take on the president in the history of this country. You are not taking on the establishment when you appoint billionaires after billionaires and when you de-regulate many of the large banks on World Street. You are not taking on the establishment, you are part of the billionaire establishment. You know, Donald Trump likes to present himself as a tough guy. He is a very tough guy when it comes to tearing babies out of the arms of their mothers on the southern border. But he is not such a tough guy when it comes to taking on Putin. He is a tough guy when it comes to cutting health care for children not such a tough guy when it comes to the dictators in Saudi Arabia and their mother. He is a tough guy when it comes to mocking women who have been subjected to sexual assault, very tough guy, but not such a tough guy when it comes to dealing with dictators all across this world. And I want to say something about that. People in this room, people in this state, people in my state, fought and died to defend American democracy. People fought and died for people's right to vote for people's right to speak out for a free media. And we want a president of the United States to defend democracy and human rights around the world not to cuddle up with terrible dictators and murderers. And on a personal note, I want to thank the people of Wisconsin because when I ran for president in 2016, you were there. And the importance of that victory here in Wisconsin and in 21 of the states, the importance of gaining 13 million votes, the importance of winning more votes from younger people black and white and Latino and Asian American and Native American. And the importance of all of that was that we showed the world that the time is now for dealing with a corrupt economic and political system. And that together the American people are prepared to stand up for economic, social, racial and environmental justice. And the result of all of that, the important result is that ideas that are just a few years ago seem radical and extreme. And we were attacked day and night by every editorial board, writer in America, and by the establishment, all of those so-called radical ideas are now strongly supported by the American people. Thank you, Wisconsin. Three years ago, we said that in Wisconsin over month in America, if you work 40 hours a week, you're not going to live in poverty. We're going to raise that minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour. And guess what, all over America, cities and states, and by the way, Amazon now paying 15 bucks an hour. And we said that it is absurd that in America, eight women are making 80 cents on the dollar compared to men, we're going to have pay equity, equal pay for equal work. And we said that in this moment in history, all of our young people and people who are not so young, have the right to get a higher education regardless of their income. And what we said, we said that if this country is going to do well economically in a competitive global economy, we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free and lower student debt. And all across the country, you're seeing states and communities moving in that direction. Everybody is entitled to a higher education if they have the ability and the desire. And I don't want to see hundreds of thousands of young people denied that opportunity. And we said, we said a few years ago, something that really speaks to what we must become as a nation. We said that in America, healthcare must be a human right, not a privilege. And we said that there is something wrong about a dysfunctional healthcare system in which 30 million people have no health insurance and many of you are underinsured. A system in which we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. A system which enables us to be the only major country on earth, not the guarantee healthcare to all people. And what we said is this country must move to a Medicare for all single payer program. And guess what? With Tammy's support and with the support of a number of members of the Senate, the last poll that I saw on that issue has 70% of the American people supporting Medicare for all. And on and on it goes, many of those issues that we talked about are now kind of mainstream issues. And we're making real progress on that and we should all be proud of that. But when we talk about Trump, I want to say one more point. And that is yes, Tammy and I disagree with Trump on his economic policies, on his climate change policies. But there is a deeper level that we have very, very strong offense to what he is doing. And that is the following. Throughout the history of this country, all of you know that good people have put their lives on the line to fight against all forms of discrimination. From the days of the first settlers coming here, we all know the terrible things that were done to Native Americans. We all know about the abomination of slavery and racism and segregation. We know that a hundred years ago today, women in America did not have the right to vote. We know about all of the ugliness that was pushed on the GLGBT community. We know about the religious bigotry, the prejudices against Catholics and Italians and Irish and Jews. We know all of that history. But we also know something else that over those hundreds of years, good people, brave people, put their lives on the line to understand that we are the people of the world. And that we are a common, you not humanity, that no matter where we were born, what the color of our skin is, what our sexual orientation may be, we are one people. And virtually every president in recent history has understood that his function was to bring people together. That's what you do when you're president of the United States. But now we have a president who, for cheap political reasons, thinks that he can win votes by dividing us up by getting one group of people to hate another group. And I say this from the bottom of my heart to Donald Trump. This country has struggled with discrimination and racism and sexism and homophobia for too long. Mr. Trump, we are not going backwards. We are going forwards. So brothers and sisters, right now we've got two weeks to an election. Let's do it. Let's tell Trump and his friends, it's still Trump and Walker and all of these guys, that we want a government and an economy based on justice. We want a government and an economy that represents all of us and not the one percent. And we are going to begin the process of making that happen today and through tomorrow and the next day until November 6th. Let us have a huge vote of turnout. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " I'm happy to hear of your focus on our American Samoa Constitution. It's an important document. This is a great topic for you to study, and I know you'll find it interesting. As with any Constitution, it's deliberately difficult to change. The reason is that a Constitution is meant to be a rock of stability. It ensures that our laws and the rights of people cannot suddenly change direction beyond the confines of what the Constitution allows. So American Samoa has a Constitution. Under it we have major differences from the other territories. For instance, the way we select our senators in our land tenure system. These are unique to us in all of the nation. In contrast, Guam and the Virgin Islands have an organic act, and neither of them operates with a Constitution. However, every U.S. state has its own Constitution fitting in within the framework that the U.S. Constitution establishes as to what powers belong to the national government and what falls under state and local governments. American Samoa really has a one-of-a-kind relationship with the United States. It is special in several ways. That can be a difficulty because Congress tends to look at things with a one-size-fits-all approach, especially as the federal government has developed in the modern era into involvement in local schools and roads and really most parts of life, particularly providing a safety net for people when they go through a hard time. These are good things that developed over time, but can cause points where the local government and the national government have different ideas. Constitutions help resolve those situations by establishing principles that are purposefully slow to change. Our American Samoa Senate has just passed a resolution saying they'd like a change in the current U.S. public law to allow them to pursue potential changes in our territories Constitution in the future without the backstop of Congress. Change seems to come slowly, but looking back, there have been huge changes in our local government and our relationship with the United States. American Samoa became a U.S. territory by deed of session starting in 1900. The Matai or Chiefs of Trutuila seated the island through the United States in 1900. Manua followed in 1904, Swain's island joined the territory in 1925 by an act of Congress. Authority was initially placed with the U.S. Navy which oversaw the territory until 1951. The U.S. Navy was then transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1951 where it is currently. And Congress has vested the Secretary of Interior with authority to veto any local law. The people of American Samoa can have a lot of influence and self-determination when it's needed. For instance, after World War II, U.S. Department of Interior sponsored an attempt to incorporate American Samoa called the Organic Act number 4,500. This was defeated in Congress and accomplishment primarily through the efforts of American Samoa's Chiefs led by high-talking chief, Puyasasopo Mariotta. It was the efforts of these Chiefs that led to the creation of a local legislature, the American Samoa Fono. That was a huge step for our islands. In time, the Navy appointed Governor was replaced first by an appointed one. My father, Ufat Thali Peter Coleman, another major step forward to have a Governor from our own people. He helped lead the forming of a Constitution that started in 1960. The Constitution took effect on July 1, 1967, yet another big step. In 1977, along came another important step. The first constitutional elections were that year, electing my father as Governor by the choice of the people, the voters, no longer by appointment of the federal government. In Washington, only handfuls of people truly understand most of this. In fact, I'm often asked questions. Sometimes I'm even asked, when will the two Samoas merge? I answer when Canada merges with the United States. We are called American Samoa for a reason. Much like the U.S. and Canada, we share a lot of customs and language with our nearest neighbor, independent Samoa, but they are and will remain a friend and neighbor, not the same country. We are very proud of our ties to the United States. That said, we have one big difference. Unlike other U.S. territories who are U.S. citizens, American Samoans are U.S. nationals. Neither citizens nor nationals of U.S. territories vote in federal elections when residing in their territories and they pay their taxes locally, not federally. On the flip side, we do participate in most federal funding programs such as Medicaid. These differences are designed in large part to protect our land and our culture by our choice and by agreement with the federal government. Many fundamental changes to our Constitution must be approved by both houses of Congress. For instance, there is a court case in which it appears we have defeated, but that would have compelled the United States citizenship on our people. Now U.S. citizenship can be a wonderful thing, but it absolutely must be a matter of self-determination for American Samoa. How are people have to make that decision for themselves? So far, the U.S. courts have agreed to this principle in several major rulings because of this we look forward to a future that maintains the Fasamoa and that's part of the purpose of our Constitution. Enjoy your day learning about our Constitution. Soy Fua, Ma'iamanum.",

        "transcript": " Content All right, welcome to bringing it back to the people. I'm Andrea Tufola, representative for District 43, the State House of Representatives, and I'm here with Amara Marta, who is also a Congresswoman from American Samoa, just recently elected, and we're going to talk about some of the things that she's been going through as a Congresswoman and see how some of that ties into what we're doing here in Hawaii, some of the things that we have in common is that we're both newly elected Samoa and women. And so I want this Congresswoman to basically explain to us a little bit about her background and how she got into the Congress. So the things that happened was that the prison held your seat prior to you after 26 years. That's right. And so how hard was it for you to win this election? It was very difficult. What we did was we conducted a very grassroots campaign, and what that meant was that we took the campaign and do every village, knocked on every door, climbed up and down mountains, knocked chaste and bitten by dogs. But another interesting aspect of it was that there were actually nine candidates running. So in addition to the 13-term income, there was also on ballot a two-term government plus six other candidates and then yourself. So it made particularly tough. But God blessed us on the next day. And fully intent to not disappoint the people. Of all the people who were running, how many of them are female? There were three females, including myself. And coming from a society where you come from, where it's kind of male dominated or you know, leadership, how did the people take that? And why do you think their presence was towards a female someone who would be represented this time around? Well, when I talked to my father about this, and a year ago, about wanting to run for public office, he looked at me and he said, well, it's going to be tough. It's going to take a very long time, probably 20 years. And as it turns out, that is how long it took for me to get in. See, I first started running in 1994. Really, I've run every two years for Congress since then. After 10 tries, I was ready to hang it up. But my supporters were just warming up. And so we decided to give it another go around. And on the level to try, we were victorious. Wow. Wow. That kind of surprised me because I didn't know that that had happened. Trying 11 times, I think here on how many people tried two, three times, and then they stopped. You know, they think maybe it's not their time for me. It was the very first time I had ever run. But my predecessor had held the seat for eight years. And in Hawaii, once you get in one election, it's so hard to lose your seat because of name recognition, because of just everyone kind of wanting the same person, the same status quo, whatever is being offered. And in Samoa, they must have really wanted a change. Because 26 years of having the same person. So what is going on in American Samoa that you think kind of generated that desire for a change? Well, I do think that the young people are waking up. Part of it is also the internet. And right now we are laying the fiber optic cable in the outer islands of Ophor, Seman, Tauro. And that means the communications will really explode. It was also the use of social media. Many, many Samoans like Facebook and all of this. We don't have access to the kind of campaign tools that are available up here. As you know, we have one weekly newspaper, in other words, one daily. And then one that comes out three times a week, and it's online. The one TV station is owned by the government. So you cannot ever use it for campaign campaigns. And then there's radio, which is fairly expensive. But what we did was we combined some state-side tactics along with cultural resources. And that's how we went ahead. But amazing, congratulations. I think for me, I had the same experience as her where you just have to get really grassroots when you're trying to run for office. If you really want to leverage the people, you have to go out there and be with the people and talk to the people. And I'm glad that now they have some social media. But regardless of social media, the face-to-face contact is really important. Because the people really know that you care about them. And so what is one of the things that you've pushed for since you've been elected? Well, we need better help in the area of health, education, and then jobs. We have quite a few unemployed people. And that's the result of our can-wee chicken of the sea closing up shop in 2009, the day after a killer tsunami hit us. So all in one fell swoop. Three thousand people were out of work. So jobs are extremely important right now. Our basic needs are needs that are taken for granted here in Hawaii, as well as the rest of the states. These are things that people have been getting up here for a long time. We're still struggling to improve our infrastructure, try to improve the disparity between American Samoan students in education. These are the ones in the states. So that is what we have been working very hard on. As far as my legislative agenda, these are just six little things that are based on what I talk to at the grassroots level. People said that this was important to them. And so we have already started to introduce legislation to that effect. It's been really, really exciting. I do not vote on House 4. But that's not really important because I remember the House Republican conference, which as you know is a formal assembly of Republican members. And all of the major pieces of legislation that are going to reach the House 4, get ironed out and discussed in the House Republican conference. We were just warming up. Good, good, I'm glad. Glad to hear that. In American Samoan, you guys also have a community college as you spoke about education. So how is the American Samoan community college going? And how are you looking to improve it for the people? Yes, absolutely. We lost our upward-bound program and little things like that help our youngsters, especially those who are, they could be the first person going to college in that particular family. So we have a four-year college in terms of you can get a bachelor's degree in education, but it's a two-year college for all other courses. And one of your things is also that you grew up here in Hawaii. Am I right? Did you go to high school here? I did grow up here, but I went to high school here at Sacred Hearts and I'm a kid. And with a special arrangement, I was able to board at Sacred Hearts Company one and then dance with drive me to come here. For all of you just tuning in, this is Congresswoman Almata Ray Lagam. And she's just recently elected to Congress. But what I'm mentioning here is that for many of the Samoans, you can correct me if I'm wrong. Coming to high school here in Hawaii is an opportunity that many of them take. And so she was able to attend Sacred Hearts. That's right. And so she does have some Hawaii connections. So coming here to Hawaii since you did your high school years here, how do you see it different or the same as what you have to do in American Samoan? It was quite a incarceration process for me. And I missed back home. I never thought that I would really go much beyond education in the village here. But my parents had some other things in mind. And they wanted me to broaden my horizons. So the first step was to come here at Sacred Hearts again. Very blessed. I grew up with the Hallock family and they lived next to us in Hawaii. And they went to Punehul. And I always thought that it was different because their parents still worked in Samoa. And they were still running the tune of business and everything. And their kids were just coming here for high school. And as soon as they finished, they went back to Samoa. But I see it as an opportunity, as you said, to broaden the horizon for the young people. And one of the things that she also did was that she appealed to the young people in this past election where she was successful. So what is the voter percentage out in Samoa? A lot of people get out in vote. Not so many. It's actually fairly high. In the last election, I would say the turnout was 85%. Certainly a lot more than in the United States. That's very high. And I don't know if you know the specific breakdown. But how many young people came out in vote? Were you guys able to do this spread of ages? Or is it mostly older folks that are voting? Quite a few of them were young people. Many of them voted for the first time. So part of our grassroots effort was we had to go reach out to them. There are young tongue-ends. When you were born in American Samoa, you were US national, whether you're Samoa or not. And we would go out into the villages and befriend them and bring them in to get them registered and so forth and so on. And it just kind of took off. I think the young people in American Samoa are looking for hope. They are looking for a better future and perhaps their parents are having. Yeah, yeah. It's very exciting because here in Hawaii we are struggling trying to get people to get out in vote. And I'm not sure if it's the same as Samoa, but here I think that we really had a lack of leadership. Now when I say that, I don't mean that we don't have leaders. We have leaders all over the place, but people can really inspire people and let them know that something will actually happen. When you vote, something might happen. I might listen to you and I think that one of the pieces of legislation you just put forward might give people that hope. Can you explain to us about your bill, about banking, that might help the people in Samoa? Well, it is a... ...checks that come in from off-violent or held by the bank for 21 days. And a lot of times people are trying to make the finances fit. That is a real hardship. So I hope to get that all done in the past, send it in. And that would be President Saundering to roll before too long. And we feel it as though our chances are quite good. It's exciting because even though it sounds like maybe it's something small, it's something that's going to affect every person in Samoa. That's right. And that's the kind of legislation that we need to pass is the ones that are going to help people in their everyday struggles. Not in the struggles that are in five or ten years, but the struggles we have every day. One of the things she brought up is that it's almost like fixing a pothole. For the people in Hawaii, some of the stuff that I'm doing doesn't take legislation to fix traffic or to help them with the commute home. And this is what people are looking for. The looking for leaders that are going to help them get through their everyday struggles and know that their elected officials are listening to them. And that's something very important that both she and I agree on is that the people's voices need to be heard and that's why we're grassroots. That's why we're talking to the people because we wanted to hear what they had to say about how we could make our communities better. So, Congresswoman, is there anything else you'd like to share with us as far as your new journey in the US, Congress? How has it felt? Oh, it is great. And I look forward to continuing to work with you. And I'm just very, very excited and I see a great right future ahead for you. And I'm all the best. Thank you. Thank you so much for tuning in. Bringing it back to the people for all you saw Moons out there for the title of the Lava will be back and hopefully she and I will do more things together. Other huh?",

        "transcript": " Music Afidee. All right, the Lofa Lava. So happy to see you here. So happy to see our special guest here. This is quite an opportunity for us here at the University of Guam to hear from someone who's very special. There's a lot of intersections in her life with the life, not only of the University of Guam, the only member of Congress ever who is a graduate of the University of Guam. Right? So. And they're very happy to know that. And of course, in the course of that, her life is intersected with a number of people over the years here at the University of Guam, including the Yamashita family and others and Sanchez. And of course, actually friends for a long time with Senator Mary Torres. So this is an amazing experience. So, you know, I've known her since I was elected in back in the early 90s to serve in Washington, DC. Of course, she was from a different political party. But, you know, we were islanders. And so that always kind of makes sure that you kind of work together. And she is the number one, the most senior member of the Republican National Committee. So, you know, I want to lay that out because I don't ever want to be accused that I only invite Democrats to come to this. I come to the stage, you know. And I also want to acknowledge that Speaker Cruz kind of jerrymandered the session early today so that they could come here. And so we're very happy for that. And she's had, you know, in addition to being the third member of the House of Representatives as Congressional delegate from America and Samoa being preceded by the late, any Phaleo Maveenga and Fofo Sonia. She's also had many years of experience here, lived in the Marshall Islands when her father was, the Honorable Peter Coleman was district administrator, distad. I don't know how many people remember that term distad. I know there's a couple of people out there who remember that that's a really old arcade colonial term, I want to say, distad, district administrator. And of course also served as Deputy High Commissioner of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in Saipan. And so, you know, she had the opportunity to live both in the Marshall Islands and in Saipan. And of course, here on Guam as well as she came to school here. So, you know, she's had, I was just remarking how lucky we were because I was watching a signing ceremony on the Marine Monuments the other day on CNN. And, you know, of course, people were criticizing what President Trump was doing and some were applauding what he was doing. But standing right behind him was, you know, Congresswoman Radowagin. So, she's a force inside the National Republican Party has been, if you've watched National Politics over the years, if you've watched National Conventions, she's there. She's always played some kind of a very strong participatory role. And I think she really takes that role seriously in terms of her relationship to the broader Pacific Island community. And so, it's with great pleasure and honor that I introduce to you the Honorable Amata Radowagin. Thank you very much, Dr. Underwood. It's indeed a blessing and a privilege to be here today. And I'm just delighted. This is my second home. I am from American Samoa. And we do have this little custom that whenever there are two or more Samoans in the audience that we say a couple of words in the native language. So, it won't take too long if you will allow me. I told her, you know, I was out among the two. Now, if you were to think of Samoa, but you know, the people, the power, the sun, they are more than enough to pay the lot to them and then they are more than enough. Everybody calls me Amata or Amua Amata. And I am from American Samoa. Samoans are very ethnocentric. In fact, they believe that Samoa is a garden of Eden because God puts Samoans there directly. As evidence, they cite the fact that the word Samoa means holy center or sacred soul, sacred heart. And they are the only islands in Polynesia that have no folklore about canoes coming from somewhere else. To give you an example of Samoa and ethnocentricity, I want to tell you about a high chief during World War II. As a U.S. territory, American Samoa was being used as a staging area and resupply area in the rear of the front lines where the battles were going on. But in order to use the land for military purposes, the military had to get permission from the chiefs because that was part of the deal that was struck in the deed of session. All was going well in negotiations, but then the military came upon an old chief who absolutely refused to make his land available at any price. They tried and tried to negotiate, but he wouldn't budge. When the report was read by the high command in Honolulu Sinkpack, who was the top military commander for the entire Pacific War, he ordered his negotiators to invite the chief for a visit to Hawaii, where Sinkpack would negotiate himself. The old chief came up and was ushered into Sinkpack's office, which had a huge map of the region on his wall stretching from end to end. Getting up from his chair and going to the map, the Sinkpack gestured to the chief with his arm, saying, do you see that huge landmass on the left side of the map? And the chief nodded his head, yes. That is China, moving to the other side, Sinkpack continued. And do you see that large landmass on the right? Again, the chief nodded. And do you see that tiny little dot in the middle way down below the equator? That is Samoa. The old chief got up from his chair slowly, walked over to the map, put on his glasses, bent down and peered at the little dot. Then he stood up straight again, turned to the Sinkpack and said, who made this map? So when Dr. Underwood invited me to give his lecture, I was more than happy to do it because it would give me chance to come back to Guam, which I consider home, second home. Later he asked if I had a title of my lecture. I said, yes, my road to Congress runs through Guam. I learned a lot of lessons on the way. One of the first was that I would be in the public eye because my father was prominent from his days as Attorney General of American Samoa back in 1955. And then for the next 40 years, dad would be the this dad or chief administrator of one island or another. So I was never very far from the spotlight. The second thing I learned was the importance of education that my parents would always stress to me. I grew up in American Samoa, but when my father left the governorship to become the chief executive or administrator of the Marshall Islands, my parents thought it best to send me to Honlulu to school where we had family. Next four years, I attended Sacred Hearts Academy and lived in a convent where my dad's sister was a semi-coistered nun. The Marshall Islands was my first introduction to Micronesia and the next stop on my road to Guam. And as I was finishing up high school, my parents were asked to come to Sipan where dad became the district administrator of the Northern Mariana Islands. I first set foot on Guam while en route to Sipan. Once again, there being no college at all in American Samoa and no university of Guam. I believe it was still College of Guam. I graduated from Sacred Hearts in Honlulu. My parents encouraged me to go to college in the States. Work hard, Amata. Work hard. God helps those who help themselves. I remember all these stories that dad would tell me. He had a lot of little stories. I think that we children, all 13 of us, remember every single story just because we used to joke with each other that our dad actually spoke in parables. So the story is that a man was sitting on his front porch when it started to rain. The rain came down harder and harder and the man realized it was a flood. So the flood waters were rising and when the water started to spill over the porch, a man and a robot came by and the man and the robot says, do you need any help? Come with us. But the man said, nope, the Lord will take care of me. Few hours later, that man was standing on a chair on his front porch and a motorboat comes by. And the man yells inside, do you need any help? Come with us. But the man smiled and says, nope, the Lord will take care of me. A few hours later, the man is now on his roof and a helicopter comes by and the pilot yells down at him. Do you need any help? It's getting late. But the man just said, nope, the Lord will take care of me. A few hours later, the flood got to be too much for the man and he drowned. And when he got to heaven, he asked the Lord, Lord, why didn't you take care of me? I always trusted in you that you would always take care of me. The Lord said, well, I sent you a robot and a motorboat. I even sent you a helicopter. What else did you want? After that, I said, buddy, you're on your own. But so getting back to where to go to college, I could have gone to the University of Hawaii, but mom and dad wanted me to broaden my horizons. And one of the reasons I was attracted to Los Angeles was that, like Ireland, we also had relatives there. But at least they weren't in a convent. Just as I had gone home to the Marshall Islands every summer for years from school in Honolulu. While in college in Los Angeles, I also came home every summer to Sipan. So I actually spent three years in college in Los Angeles and then Loyola decided to merge with Marymount. And even though I'd been in LA for quite a while getting adjusted, it just seemed like I needed to go home, home to the islands. So the College of Guam was now the University of Guam. I enrolled. Dad and mom talked to the President of UOG, Dr. Yamashita and his lovely wife who were happy to give me a room in their beautiful home. And I cannot thank the Yamashita's enough for their kindness and understanding. And I'm just so privileged that Mrs. Yamashita and the younger daughter Duchess, I knew them as Duchess in Princess. I know they have grown up names. I think it's Velma. But I can't thank them enough. Many times I get out of my last class and I go to their home way past dinner time. And even though the family might have already gone to bed, Mrs. Yamashita always left dinner in the oven for me and I especially loved her mistake. So Mrs. Yamashita, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I wouldn't be where I am today without the help of this kind family. And when I talked to Dr. Underwood recently, he said that Mrs. Yamashita was still with us. And now we're so blessed to have her actually right in this room with us today. So thank you from the bottom of my heart, Mrs. Yamashita. So although I did spend three years at Loyola Marymount, it was really my one year that I spent here that I truly enjoyed and cared about. And I was sorry to leave at the time. Yam was on the verge of a new chapter in its history. A year later, I believe, they elected their own governor and member of Congress. The previous summer when I was home on CYPAN, I met a young man who was part of a White House National Security Task Force doing a survey of the economic development of my Kronizha. So when he came to CYPAN, we'd get together and talk and drink coffee. I believe it was 1970 when Antonio Wampat came to Congress. Although I was three credits short, I could not resist the urge to take a job I'd been offered in Washington, DC. The young man who later became my husband also would always come to Guam. And around that same time, American Samoa elected its own delegate at large and I worked for him. Paramount Chief Aou Fumonou. One thing I did do was to join the Guam Society of America in DC. So my oldest friends came from Guam. There was no American Samoa Society until much later. But Guam Society was already organized. So I've actively participated over the years. I then went on to work for the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. And indeed, American Samoa decided to elect its own governor around that time. And then another opportunity came up to come back to Guam in CYPAN. So I found a reason to come back to Guam. And it wasn't a shock to see how much progress Guam had made. Now, when I first ran for Congress in 1984, I finished with almost 30% of the vote. Dad's health had begun to fade. And I told him I really wanted to go for Congress. Well, he encouraged me to try again, but he said, you know, Amata, American Samoa is at least 20 years away from electing a woman to Congress. You need to know that. I really know it now because it took me 22 years to get into Congress. So dad, you were right on. And so down there, I was also active in the village, the local community, and the church, things, including the women's hospital, auxiliary, and mammography. We didn't have a mammogram machine. So I decided to raise funds off Island and began to speak publicly about the need for one. I ran again in 1996 and came up short. In 1998, I didn't get on the ballot because my supporters wanted to also launch a right-in campaign. Something that never had been done in American Samoa. The Election Commissioner refused to count my ballots and asked each polling station to destroy all my ballots. Well, in halfway through the counting process, after they thrown away three quarters of them, I'm sure, he reversed himself and said he would count my votes. Well, I ended up with 700 votes, you know. And because so many others had been destroyed. And in 2000, my supporters came back again and asked me to run again. To make a long story short, I had run unsuccessfully ten times and won on my 11th try. So when I came to Washington in 2015, when I mentioned that I had run 11 times, people gasped in disbelief. Some even actually fainted, you know. But the lesson I learned is never to give up perseverance. I ran all those times because I felt the voters deserved a choice. I didn't necessarily disagree with the incumbent, but he had a different approach. And in 2014, the voters spoke. And that year, there were actually nine candidates running for Congress. And I said to myself, there is no way I'm going to get past any. Then Governor Tonyola, a two-term governor who had just finished his second term. And then there was a military veteran who had his own built-in base. Plus, the other five candidates, including myself. But you know, perseverance is something I also learned in Guam. Because I was still short of three credits and was working in Washington for the Secretary of HEW. I told Mrs. Rosa Carter, she's another person I owe a great debt of gratitude to, that it would be impossible for me to physically return to take that one course in Guam. She told me, Amata, if you can get an accredited college in Washington that we can approve, then yes. You can get those three credits transferred to Guam. So, instead of being in the class of 70, which really I was supposed to be, I graduated with the class of 1975, which is actually a good thing because now people think I'm much younger than I really am. But thanks to Rosa Carter, I got my degree. Every weekend I would fly home to Sipan in those days on Air Mike, student airfare, $8 one day to go on the 737. So, when I first came to Congress, my colleagues knew very little about Americans a lot more. And I was part of the House Republican Conference. And so, because it's very rare to have a Republican delegate, they're always all Democrats, you know. And so, naturally there were a lot of questions after they found out I ran 11 times. They wanted to know about the pace of life in Americans, some more. And would I have the ability to adjust all these questions, you know. And Republican delegate, as I said, was kind of a rare bird. But it reminded me of that story of the American and the Pacific Island fishermen. And an American investment banker was at the pier of a small Pacific Island village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellow fin tuna. The American complimented the Islander on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The Islander replied, only a little while. The American then asked, why didn't you stay out longer and catch more fish? The Islander said, with this, I have more than enough to support my family's needs. The American then asked, but what do you do with the rest of your time? The Islander said, well, I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a nap with my wife. And in the evening I stroll into the village and where I drink beer and play my ukulele with my friends. I have a full and busy life. And the American scoffed, well, I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds by a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, while you can buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats and instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the processor. Eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small fishing village and move to Hun Lulu, then to Los Angeles, and eventually New York, where you will run your ever-expanding enterprise. The Islander asked, but how long will all this take? To which the American replied, 15 to 20 years. But what then asked the Islander? The American laughed and said, that's the best part. When the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions. And the Islander said millions. And then what? The American said, then you would retire. You would move to a small village, where you would sleep a little late, fish a little, play with your children, take a nap with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings, where you could have a beer and play your ukulele with your friends. Anyway, but now that I'm in Congress, I have three. So now that I'm in Congress, I have three committees. When I came in as a freshman, I think I was one of very few who had, if you were in the majority, yes. But if you were in the minority, you're probably not going to have three committee assignments. And these I felt were very relevant, not only to American side, but all the US territories. And as Dr. Underwood said earlier, we do work together. We work together because we're Islanders. This is the way we do it. We become family when we're up there. So it's natural resources, veterans affairs, and small business. I have to say that the GOP majority has treated me very, very well. And the committee on natural resources has legislative jurisdiction for the territories. So as a freshman, I chaired a small business subcommittee for health and technology. And I also was vice chairman of the Natural Resources subcommittee for Indians, insular, and Alaska natives. And my work on the Veterans Affairs Committee has been really exciting as well because almost 10% of our population consists of military veterans. So I have a good relationship with the Guam representative whom I've known for years. And actually her dad, Ms. B's dad, Mr. Zion, he worked for the trust territory government while dad was deputy high commissioner. So even though they'll never admit it, I think the other territorial representatives in Congress are happy to have me there. Because I can be like a double agent. I can actually, because I'm on the inside and go behind the house leadership lines. And I work with them with all the delegates whenever appropriate. So for example, the Veterans Choice Act, which is very big for us, is good not only for the veterans in the states, but all of the territories as well. So here we are years later and now I'm back on Guam. As Dr. Underwood mentioned, I'm also number one in seniority on the Republican National Committee. And I see some former national committee people here. Doris Brooks, Mary Torres. And what does that do? It expands your network. And Congresswoman Prudalio, she would know that she was the senior member of DNC for years. And she can tell you herself that it gives you an additional resource to work with. When she came to Congress, she decided to give up her seat on the DNC. But I kept mine. But Congressman Rob Bishop, who chairs the Natural Resources Committee, the full committee, he also served as Utah's Republican National Committee man. And we're both from the West. When I stepped into the Natural Resources Committee that first day, I immediately had an ally and a friend. And you know on the U.S. Senate side, the fourth highest ranking member of the Senate is Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming. He was the Republican National Committee man for Wyoming for many years. And he also served with me on the RNC. So you meet a lot of people when you serve more than 30 years on the RNC. But we even had him come to American Samoa recently as part of a Codel or a visit by the Congressional delegation. So having a network to advance your legislative objectives is good. However, it doesn't always work. Now, Senator Johnny Isickson of Georgia, he and I knew him since the time he was on the House side. And I was a leadership staffer working for the House Republican Conference. So we'd always been good friends. But then his district included a chicken of the sea plant, one of the chief competitors to our Charlie the Tuna. Star-kissed, which has been in American Samoa for 50 years. So he made things pretty tough for me. And when I passed my minimum wage bill for American Samoa, which was really critical at that time, on the House side, the bill was met with stiff resistance by my friend, Senator Isickson. Most of the time, however, I've gotten my bills through the House and Senate and on to the President to sign into federal law. And just I want to say that we say this in Samoa and I really do mean it. It's not I who did it. It's God who did it. But just as a freshman, I was able to get, I think, four, perhaps five of my bills signed into federal law by President Obama. And that's a very difficult thing to do. I even have colleagues from the States. How do you do this? We haven't even passed one bill yet, you know? But because I'm also on the RNC, what it means is that I have 167 people spread out through the states and territories. And it is hugely helpful. Senator Lamar Alexander, who chairs the Senate Help Committee, is someone I've known for years. He and dad, and I think Governor Otto, they served as governors together. And he and my husband served on a presidential campaign together back in the day. So here we are. And I have just one teeny little networking story. One of my colleagues, we sat next to each other for two years. We were classmates, freshmen, and natural resources. He was also from the West. And how they set you up on the dius is alphabetically. And the Republican sit on with the majority sits on one side, the minority sits on the other side. So our names were alphabetically placed. His name began with a Z. And my name began with an R. So just recently he left the house to become the secretary of the interior. And before he left, he says, Amata, I am going to look to you for a lot of help on the territories. He's been really actually working together very, very well, the honorable Ryan Zinky. One of the reasons Vice President Mike Pence was chosen by President Trump was that he wanted him to be his ambassador to the house. So a month ago, when I learned the Vice President was coming out to Asia, I pulled aside his chief of staff to urge that Americans more be part of that itinerary on their return. So the meantime, our former congressman, any Falun Mavayang, my predecessor, he passed away in February. And so I introduced a bill to name our veterans clinic after him. And because I felt that he had done all the work and he had established that VA clinic and he had been a military veteran, a Vietnam veteran, he had done many things for American Samoa. And I wanted to pay him the highest tribute that I could, some way to honor his legacy at a very high level. So we arranged it and when the Vice President came down, anyway, I should tell you that my bill passed the House and Senate quickly. President Trump signed it very quickly. It was one of only 14 bills that the President had signed into law. But it was the importance of having a network. And just because you asked the Vice President to come to American Samoa, it doesn't mean he ever will. But I called Secretary Zinke and I asked him to weigh in with the Vice President who then agreed to visit American Samoa. He reviewed our troops. We had 300 reserved troops right there in the tarmac. And we had a very nice dedication ceremony to dedicate the new sign naming the VA clinic after my predecessor, any Falun Mavayanga. And President Trump, I had already left for American Samoa when President Trump was able to sign it into law. So I asked if the Vice President could bring the pen with him to American Samoa. So I could present it to Congressman Falun Mavayanga's wife. But so while in American Samoa, Vice President Pence said, when he got out of the airplane, it feels so good to be back on American soil. Whoa, a cheer went up, you know, the Samwon people. They loved it. I spoke on the House floor last week and I know it comes as good news. But I can tell you it was good to hear the Vice President say, we are here for peace. We are here for the prosperity of all our people and we are proud the American flag flies in American Samoa. So I'm convinced that it will be incorporated into the Trump doctrine. And so what will the future bring? It's hard to say. I know there's a concern with North Korea. But to hear the Vice President say what he said, just touch the hearts of all of us. You know, recently we had something to do with a citizenship lawsuit. And when I came into office in 2014, a lawyer showed up on my doorstep, my office, and he says, well, you're my client now. And I said, huh? So a group pushing for birthright citizenship for American Samoa had brought this lawsuit. So I took a look at it. My predecessor was a strong opponent of it. And so the plaintiffs were those people and the defendants were President Obama, the governor, and now myself. And sort of underlying my philosophy is the 10th amendment. And the spirit of it, I think, is very important. The role of the federal government versus states and the people. And you know, to have an unelected branch confer citizenship on the people without their say so, that is not the way to do this. So in Congress, I spend half of my time making sure American Samoa and the territories are included in legislation that's good for us. And I spend the other half of the time making sure that American Samoa is excluded from legislation that will hurt us. And you know, I'm reminded of Governor Ricky Bordalio. He came to DC regarding a rule EPA had the Clean Air Act requiring air scrubbers for Guam. And so he didn't like that very much. And the federal government wanted Guam to install air scrubbers. So Governor Bordalio says, we are small island. The sea breezes take all that stuff away. You know, you feds, you've got these unfunded mandates. So I'm just saying be very wary. This is what Governor Bordalio said. Be very wary when the federal government says, I'm here to help you. But so I would imagine that most of you are aware that the house voted last Thursday to replace Obamacare. By the time the house had started voting, I was already in the air and root to Guam. But it probably didn't matter because I do not have a vote on the house floor. But even this bill had the votes lined up before it even came to the floor. It might have looked like a one vote victory to some of us. But I am sure our whip had several no votes lined up to change to yes votes if they were actually needed. So you know the title non-voting delegate, it's kind of a misnomer because other than the vote on final passage on the floor, delegates get all the rights and privileges as any other member. In fact, Madeline Bordalio, Kylili Sablan and I, we actually get a bigger budget than everybody else because of our travel. The travel is based on the miles. I know Dr. Underwood is aware of this. And because our home districts are thousands and thousands of miles away from Washington, D.C., they have to give us a few extra bucks. And in my case, we only have a monopoly with that Hawaiian air and two flights a week. So I never fly first class. And people always come to me, hey, you need to be in first class. But you see, if I don't fly first class, I can get two round trip coach tickets sitting down in the back where the tail is. And I do come home to America in San Moa twice a month, sometimes three times a month. So it's pretty rugged scheduling. Let me just mention in closing some of the delegate privileges that people might not be aware of. I know you know that there are five members of Congress from the U.S. territories and one from District of Columbia. But not so many people realize that these territorial delegates hold all the privileges of a member of Congress from any of the states. Except for that, as I mentioned, the right to vote on the floor of the House on final passage of legislation. But as delegates gain more and more visibility through their chairmanship, people are beginning to understand the extent of their powers and perks. What exactly are those privileges? As innocuous as the title non-voting delegate sounds. I've already said it. They have all the rights. Except that one, the final passage. But they can introduce legislation. They can offer amendments and substitutes. They have full access to the House floor. They can speak on the floor, participate in debate, manage bills, sit on committees and fully vote in those committees. It goes on and on. They can chair subcommittees and full committees. They can participate in legislative conference committees. They can accrue seniority. They can make nominations to service academies. They can hold leadership positions, including Speaker of the House, if they get enough votes. They are full voting members of their parties caucuses. And as such, they participate in their party's policy decisions and leadership elections. They are provided the same size office staffs and budgets. Well ours is just a little more than the states as the other members. And they are also assigned office space by seniority, just like any other member. They are able to preside over the committee of the whole. They have all the other perks of House membership. So the election of the non-voting delegates is not in consequential. Finally, in American Samoa, we have a saying, on all of the pool or the Tautua, meaning the road to leadership is paved with service. And it may have been in the old days applied to people in their villages. And today, my road to service went through Guam. My people in American Samoa were willing to agree that these things were not only in American Samoa, but Guam as well. So ifua, thank you. Thank you. We'd like to open the floor for some questions. The only questions that are not good are not asking a question. Yes, sir. Are you referring to the CW matter? Yes, I think they are working on it. And when you say it affects all the territories, it doesn't affect all territories the same way. I see that it's good for Guam and Saipan. I've just come from there. They definitely need more workers. Their economy is starting to boom. But if I am supporting that for Guam and Saipan, it doesn't work for American Samoa. And if I were to try to get a whole bunch of contract workers foreigners down to American Samoa, I would be out of office so fast it would even be funny. Yes, Simon? Malolabatsoi Fouq. Right? Yes. Yes. Yes. We're still wrestling with this issue. I think it's a little bit of a problem. I think it's a little bit of a problem. I think it's a little bit of a problem. I think it's a little bit of a problem. I think it's a little bit of a problem. I think it's a little bit of a problem. I think it's a little bit of a problem. Yes. That's a very good question, Simon. Almost along the lines of the contract worker matter, American Samoa has a different take on this. Now, we are all proud Americans in American Samoa. But there are some people who do not. What it is is there are U.S. National, in order to be a U.S. National, you must have been born in American Samoa. There's a U.S. National who was born and raised and is living in American Samoa. Many of them come up to the states. And what happens for them is that they begin to participate in their communities. If children go to schools, and for them, the logical thing is to become a U.S. citizen. Which many of them do. They can do that. The U.S. Nationals in American Samoa, there are some who would like to be U.S. citizens. But there are those who don't want that because our culture was still living this ancient culture, which we take seriously. And the feeling is that they ought to be able to be U.S. citizens anytime they want. Now, the problem with a U.S. National applying for U.S. citizenship is they have to apply as if they're an alien. And that is not right. That means they have to pay $595 as the fee. They've got to go to this U.S. soil that's defined as the U.S. soil that will allow you to eventually get your citizenship and all that. Now, we have asked the people, believe me, everybody I talk to along the way, I urge Samoans to become U.S. citizens if they want to. The thing is that they don't want this. Now, did American Samoa ever have a chance to be offered the organic act? As a matter of fact, it was in 1949 or 1950. And I think it was HR 45,000 or something. The White House was all in favor of it then. The House and the Senate, they were excited about it. And they were ready to push this through because Americans say, yes, the greatest thing that could happen to a person is to become a U.S. citizen. There are people who don't necessarily agree with that thinking. So, they brought this bill down to American Samoa and the Fono, our legislature looked at it. And in the end, they said, thank you, but no, thank you. Some of us would like to be able to be U.S. citizens at a time of our own choosing. But the automatic citizenship would not advance. There's a fear in American Samoa. See, unlike Guam, where you have a lot of land, we don't have that much land. So, we're actually stingy with our land. And so, there is this fear that if everybody gets blanket citizenship, then it's going to allow all U.S. citizens who have the money and the ability to tempt that person to sell their land to them, to sell the land. And eventually, the land will be gone. And many U.S. nationals fear it. And also, they are living in the Fatsamoa. And the land and the blood are one. In the American way, land is what? A commodity. If you have money, you want to buy it, go buy it. If you get tired of it, go sell it. But with a deed of session, we cannot alienate our land. And as the military, as a SincPak discovered, when he went to go and ask this old chief about the land, it is still that way today. I say that what I've offered to our people is that I've already drafted a bill. This bill would simplify the citizenship process for U.S. nationals. I don't think it should take more than a half an hour to become a U.S. citizen if you're a U.S. national. I'm already inside the naturalization arena. So, I don't know if that helps, but thank you for your question. Any other questions? Well, thank you very much. You",

        "transcript": " I'm pleased to join you today with an update for the Western Caucus. I'm proud to represent American Samoa, a beautiful group of seven islands in the Pacific Ocean. We may not be the first place you think of in the Western Caucus. I joined this caucus not just because we are thousands of miles to the west of most of the country, but because of shared interests and priorities. For instance, we have two rainy seasons, so we aren't as likely to see a furious wildfire like those causing so much damage this year in the Western U.S. Instead, our highly trained teams of expert firefighters went in during those efforts. When the firebell rings, that's what firefighters do. They respond and wherever they're from, we're proud of them all. Like other parts of the West, we in American Samoa have beautiful places and coastlines, including National Park and Monument areas that cover both sea and land. Very proud of the work the Western Caucus has put into these issues and the leadership of so many of my colleagues. In each of our districts, our monument area might look a little different from another place, but there are important underlying issues that are the same. For instance, is there good local input from the people who know the area best? We're working together in Congress to ensure state, local and territorial input for monument decisions. That's just common sense. Protecting beautiful places doesn't have to cause harm to nearby small businesses. That's why a bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. shouldn't be the only one with a voice. In American Samoa, decisions in Washington about a marine monument placed our traditional fishing grounds and waters off limits, despite generations of use. Fishing is part of our heritage and Fassamoa, our special way of life. We're working together so that Congress must be consulted on future marine monument decisions so the people living there are truly represented, just as the country's founders intended. That's just a small part of what the Western Caucus is all about, and that's why we work together in Congress to keep these beautiful places, mountains, deserts and islands. Not only beautiful, but also free, prosperous, and respectful of our heritage. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Mr. Radarwagon, you're recognized. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I welcome the panel. Thank you for your appearance today. Ms. Bradley, before VA compiled the documents to satisfy this committee's request, have you or anyone else at VA ever compiled all of these settlement agreements into one place for a nationwide review so you could see the overall cost of taxpayers? I have not. Ms. Bradley, has any thought been given to doing what it is I asked about? In other words, you say nothing's been compiled but has any thought been given to such a possibility? Well, I don't want the committee to believe that nothing's been compiled. You asked me if my office, I'm in the Office of General Council, we didn't compile that data. We don't track the total number of payouts. I think that it's fair to say that the administrations are very attentive and track that information as they should because, again, these are business decisions and the money comes out of their operating budget. I would say what I track as the general council is, can we show our veterans, can we show the American people, can we show this committee that when we uncover wrongdoing, whether it's racial discrimination, or whether it's whistleblower retaliation, or something along those lines, can we show the American people that we will hold those wrongdoers accountable? That is what I've been really focused on doing in my office, focused on doing it in our training, focused on doing it with respect to the standup of the office in my shop called the Office of Accountability Review, ensuring that we have put really top-notch investigators on the Office of Accountability Review, so they can provide to us competent investigations with sound evidence so that when we take these actions, we won't have them overturned. Those are some of the things that my office and that I personally have been focused on. And speaking as my previous job as a medical center director, that was a fundamental piece of what I looked at regularly with the rest of the leadership team, was, for example, the number of EEO complaints that we have, the number of labor grievances, those sort of human resource indicators that would give us a sense of the health of the organization. And from a VBA perspective, we do the same thing at the district. Obviously, we're probably a fraction of the size of VHA, so we can look even closer at those agreements from a enterprise level. So at each of our districts, as well as in our office, a resolution management within VBA, we do that same thing. Mr. Bachman, what level of transparency do you have into whether employees who retaliate against whistleblowers are properly disciplined? As I said, our first mission, our primary responsibility at OSC is to make sure we're helping to protect whistleblowers. And through that, we have been using settlement agreements with the VA to make sure that they're able to get back on their job, continue serving veterans. And that's really needed to be our primary responsibility. At the same time, however, we have really been working to approve actions on the disciplinary front to help the VA improve accountability there. And to that end, we've got several ongoing disciplinary action investigations, I've mentioned. But I think an important one to point out is that over the last few years, the VA is disciplined over 40 VA employees who were implicated in wrongdoing that was brought to light by VA whistleblowers who would come to OSC to make their whistleblower discloser there. And I think that's an important point because it shows the role that whistleblowers, as well as OSC, can take in helping the VA to improve their accountability. Two of those 40 folks that the VA has disciplined, those involved removals of high level officials at the Fort Collins, Colorado facility, which was struggling with the wait time manipulation problem there. So I think there has been an ability to take some accountability, not always through the strict litigation sense, but through other coordination between OSC and VA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you very much, Mr. Radowaggin.",

        "transcript": " We are here at this historic Democratic Convention to nominate Hillary Clinton, the next president, and Tim Cain, the next vice president of the United States. I want to share a little bit of my story because it's an American story. It's the story of millions of Latinos and Latinas across this country. I'm the daughter of immigrant parents from Mexico. They came to this country and worked hard every day to provide for me and my brothers and sisters. My father Ignacio was an industrial mechanic and my mother Maria became an elementary school teacher after raising a family. They owned their own home. They sent all seven of their children to college. My mother and father saved and sacrificed to achieve the American dream for our family. They weren't given their success. They earned it. Donald Trump believes that Mexican immigrants are murders and rapists. But what about my parents, Donald? Let me tell you what my parents are. They are the only parents in our nation's 265-year history to send not one but two daughters to the United States Congress. Like my parents, Hillary Clinton believes the United States is a country where people of all backgrounds can make a home and a better life. But that America isn't possible if we allow Donald Trump and his Republican Party to build a wall that divides us. I stand here tonight as the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and a proud Congresswoman from California, but most importantly, I'm here as a mom. We all want what's best for our kids. We want our children to grow up to be healthy, successful and kindhearted. Our job is to nurture them and be good role models for them to follow as they grow. Now I'll be the first to tell you that being a parent is hard, but Donald Trump is making it a whole lot harder. He has taken the low road time and time again. He's been vulgar and he's been intolerant or as we say in Spanish, unseem that whensa. He peddles fear and insecurity to divide the people of this great country. Tell me what kind of example would we set for our children by allowing a bully to sit in the overall office? We know that our children aren't born with hate or racism in their hearts. They learn it from watching the world around them and following the example of the adults in their life. Too many of our children are watching and learning the wrong lessons from Donald Trump. We've seen it in Indiana basketball game where a group of white students started chanting build that wall to taunt players from a predominantly Hispanic high school. This is the behavior that Donald Trump inspires in our youth. A Trump presidency would be a signal to our children that we condone this kind of behavior. Well that is a message I refuse to accept. Who we vote for says a lot about our values. There are few moments in history that have an impact on the trajectory of the world. I believe that this election is one of those moments. Our children are watching us. Their future depends on the outcome of this race. Do we want a responsible leader or allowed mouthful? Do we want a president who respects women or who calls them names and devalues them? Do we want a president who appreciates the contributions immigrants make to our country or someone who vilifies them? Hillary Clinton is the only choice for president. She is a president we can be proud of. And Donald, let me just say this. America is great. It is the country that gave my family the opportunity for a better life just like all immigrants who came before them. It is because of our diversity that we are the envy of the world. Hillary simply knows how to do it and he knows what he needs. We have to respect and respect the elections in November. Like I said in the video, Hillary Clinton is badass and ready to lead. Let's win in November.",

        "transcript": " I stand before you today, not as a Congressman from the inner city of Baltimore, but as a son of former Sarah Croppers, who spanned started on a farm in the lowlands of South Carolina with no running water, no toilet, but who believed in education and taught their children the value of helping others. My father, the late Robert Cummings, a man who left school after the foot of grade to fly the fields and to pick the cotton. He's one of the smartest people I've ever known. He says, son, the test of a man is not how much he helps himself. The true test is whether he helps those less fortunate. He would say, son, you go to school to get blessed so you can bless. And that is a standard by which he mentioned me growing up and is the standard by which I still measure myself. And it's the standard we Democrats use today. I stand before you because my parents saw promise in their seven children, but my parents did not do it alone. No one does it alone. It was our Democratic party. They pushed open the doors of opportunity for me and for millions of children all across this great country. It was our party that fought for head start and good schools. And made college affordable and champion affirmative action and school de-segregation that passed Social Security and Medicare that defended our nation abroad, fought for veterans back home that protected the rights and the pensions of our workers and that made the dream of home ownership possible for millions of American families. Yes, it still is our Democratic party that check in civil rights and voting rights and voting rights. It's we Democrats who fully understand that when you take away a person's rights of vote, you take away their ability to save and determine their own destiny. And it was and it is our Democratic party that fights for women's rights, gay rights, the LGBTQ rights. Our party does not just believe but understands that Black Lives Matter. But we also recognize that our communities and our law enforcement work best when they work together. Our party, our party, our party knows that diversity is not our problem but is our promise. And that's why, ladies and gentlemen, that's why ours is the party of unity and not division. I'm proud that our party's platform will help not the wealthy, not the 1% but in still it will help our struggling middle class, our working families to disadvantage and to disabled. It will help the less fortunate. Our platform has passed my father's test and it is done so not by seeking common ground but aspiring to higher ground. It invisions a nation where we do not mille increase the minimum wage but we enact a living wage. It invisions a nation in which we eliminate the deaf penalty because we as Democrats we value every life, Black, White, Asian, every life. It invisions a nation where we do not have to choose between protecting the environment and creating jobs but we can defend our planet against global warning while at the same time enacting policies that foster job creation and incentivize new startups and bring expatriated jobs back home. It invisions a nation where every child can get a first rate education and leave school equipped to compete in a global economy. It invisions an America in which we protect a woman's right to choose. Where everyone can get the healthcare they need when they need it. Regardless of their zip code or circumstance, because healthcare in our country is not a privilege. Now thanks to President Barack Obama, our right as Americans. And so Madam Chair, when I say my prayers at night and I look up to the heavens, I see the stars and sometimes I see my father. I know tonight he's smiling on all of us and he like me is proud. I'm proud of our platform committing our truly progressive platform and our great nominee Hillary Clinton and our party's right future. And it's my father and it's my father that bring it man with a fourth grade education but a mind full of wisdom and common sense. And I know he would be proud of all of you and he would say these words that this election is bigger than Hillary Clinton, bigger than Bernie Sanders is bigger than all of us. It's about generations get on board. And he would say and he would say these simple words, you are blessed so you can bless others. Go out there and vote and don't stop lifting up the American people. May God bless, may God bless America. Amen.",

        "transcript": " No Phileducation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. 240 years ago, our forefathers gathered in this very city. And they declared before the world that we would be a free and independent nation. Today, we gather here again in this city, in this city of brotherly love, to reaffirm our values before our nation and the whole world. Our purpose is not like theirs to start a great nation, but to ensure that we continue in the best of our traditions. And with humble homage to generations of patriots before, we put forth two great Americans, our nominees, for President and Vice President Hillary Clinton and Tim Cain. Now, looking back to our history, looking back to our history, our founding fathers, put forth founding documents that were indeed genius. But our founding documents weren't genius because they were perfect. They were saddled with the imperfections and even the bigotry of the past. Native Americans were referred to as savages. Black Americans were fractions of human beings, and women were not mentioned at all. But those facts and ugly parts of our history don't distract from our nation's greatness. In fact, I believe we are an even greater nation, not because we started perfect, but because every generation has successfully labored to make us a more perfect union. Generations of heroic Americans have made our nation more inclusive, more expansive, and more just. Our nation wasn't founded because we all look alike, or pray to life, or descend from the same family tree. But our founders in their genius, in this, the oldest constitutional democracy on the planet Earth, they put forth the idea that all are created equal, that we have an alienable rights. And I'm so proud that it was upon this faithful foundation that we built a great nation. And today, no matter who you are, rich or poor, Asian or white, man or woman, gay or straight, any religion or not at all, you are entitled to the full rights and responsibilities of citizenship. In this city, our founders put forth a declaration of independence, but let me tell you, they also made a historic declaration of interdependence. They knew that if this country was to survive and thrive, we had to make an unusual and extraordinary commitment to each other. Now, look, I respect and value the ideals of individualism and self-reliance. But rugged individualism didn't defeat the British. It didn't get us to the moon. It didn't build our nation's highways. Rugged individualism didn't map the human genome. We did that together. So this is the high call of patriotism. Patriotism is love of country, but you can't love your country without loving your country men and your country women. Now, we don't always have to agree, but we must be there for each other. We must empower each other. We must find the common ground and we must build bridges across our differences to pursue the common good. Let me tell you, we cannot devolve into our nation, to a nation where our highest aspirations are that we just tolerate each other. We are not called to be a nation of tolerance. We are called to be a nation of love. That's why that last line of the Declaration of Independence says it so clearly. It says that we must to make this nation work, we must mutually pledge to each other our lives and our fortunes and our sacred honor. Tolerance is the wrong way. Tolerance says I'm just going to stomach your right to be different. That if you disappear from the face of the earth, I'm no better or worse off. But love, love knows that every American has worth and value that no matter what their background, no matter what their race or religion or sexual orientation, love, love recognizes that we need each other. That we as a nation are better together. That when we are divided, we are weak, we decline, yet when we are united, we are strong. When we are indivisible, we are invincible. This, this, this is the understanding of love that's in body, in one of my favorite sayings. It's an African saying and it says if you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together. This, this is the reason why I am so motivated in this election because I believe this election is a referendum on who best embodies the leadership we need to go far together. Donald Trump is not that leader. We've watched him try to get laughs at other people's expense, try to incite fear at a time we need to inspire courage, try to rise in the polls by dragging our national conversation into the gutter. We've watched him mock, cruelly mock, a journalist's disability. We've watched him just being the service of my senate colleague saying he's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. Trump said I don't like people who get captured. Would he say that to POWs from World War II? Would he say that to POWs from Vietnam? Would he say that to the brave men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan right now risking capture or worse? That's not the commander of chief. We've watched Donald Trump paint with a broad divisive brush saying that Mexican immigrants who came to build a better life in America are in his words, bringing crime, they're bringing drugs. He called many of them rapists. He said that an Indiana-born federal judge can't be trusted to do his job because of his Mexican ancestry, a statement that his fellow Republicans have described as racist. We've watched Donald Trump. Our children, our daughters, our nieces and grandkids have watched Donald Trump and heard him calling women degrading and demeaning names. The truth is, dog, fat pig, disgusting animal. It is a twisted hypocrisy when he treats other women in a manner he would never, ever accept from another man speaking about his daughters or his wife. In this great nation where our founders put a fundamental principle forward of religious freedom, he says ban all Muslims. Don't let certain people into our America because of how they pray. Now, I take particular interest in the fact that Trump says he would run our country like he's run his businesses. Well, I'm from Jersey and I'm from the great garden state and we've seen how he leads in Atlantic City. He got rich while his companies declared multiple bankruptcies. Yet without remorse, even as people got hurt and lost jobs by his failures, he bragged and I quote, the money I took out of there was incredible. Yes, he took out a lot of cash, but he stiffed contractors, many of them small businesses, refusing to pay them for the work that they've done. You know, we in America have seen enough of a handful of people growing rich at the cost of a nation descending into crisis. America, at our best, we stand up to bullies and we fight those who seek to demean and degrade other Americans. In times of crisis, we don't abandon our values, we double down on them. Even amidst the crisis of the civil war, Lincoln stood up and called out to all of our country saying with malice towards none and charity towards all. This is our history. This is a history that I was taught. My parents never wanted my brother and I to get too heavy gratitude was our gravity. So they never stopped reminding my brother and I that our blessings sprang from countless ordinary Americans who showed extraordinary acts of kindness, decency and love. People who struggle and sweat and blood for our rights, people who pay the ultimate price for the freedoms we all enjoy. I was told that we can't pay those Americans back for their colossal acts of service, but we have an obligation to pay it forward, to others through our service and our sacrifice. I support Hillary Clinton because these are her values and she has been paying it forward her entire life long before she got in politics. She was in Massachusetts going door to door collecting the stories of children with disabilities. In South Carolina, she fought to reform the juvenile justice system so that children wouldn't be thrown in adult prisons. In Alabama, she helped expose the remnants of segregation in schools in Arkansas. She started a legal aid clinic to make sure poor folks could get their day in court. She has fought for the people and she's delivered. That's why we trust her to fight and deliver for us as president. But let me tell you, we have a presidential nominee in Clinton who knows that in a time of stunningly wide disparities of wealth in our nation, that America's greatness must not be measured by how many millionaires and billionaires we have, but how few people we have living in poverty. Hillary knows that when workers make a fair wage, it doesn't just help their families, it builds a stronger and more durable economy that expands opportunity and makes all of us Americans wealthier. She knows that in a global knowledge based economy, the country that out educates the world will out earn the world, out innovate the world and will lead the world. She knows that debt-free college is not a gift, it's not charity, it is an investment. It represents the best of our values, the best of our history, and the best of our party, all of our shared ideas and values together. Hillary Clinton knows that when we pay, have paid family leave, that this is something that must happen, because when a parent doesn't have to choose between being there for a sick child and paying went, or when a single mom earns an equal wage for equal work, it empowers the most important building block in all of our nation, and that is the family. Hillary Clinton knows that security doesn't come from scapegoating other people because of their religion, alienating our allies, stoking fear and pointing fingers. It comes when we ban together to face down and defeat our common enemy, and she knows something that I fight for every day that our criminal justice system desperately needs reform, that we need to bring back fairness to a system that still, as Professor Brian Stevenson says, treats you better if you are rich and guilty than poor and innocent. And she knows that we can be a nation that both believes police officers deserve more respect, they deserve more support, more cooperation and love, and believe that a black 20-something-year-old protestor deserves to be valued, deserves to be heard, that they should be listened to with more courageous empathy, and that change is needed in the system. And Hillary Clinton knows what Donald Trump betrays time and time again in this campaign that we are not a zero-sum nation. It is not you or me, it is not one America against another American, it is you and I, together, interdependent, interconnected with one single interwoven destiny when we respect each other. When we stand up for each other, when we work together against our challenges, against our neighbor's challenges, be it a neighbor with a beautiful, special needs child, or one struggling with the ugly disease of addiction. When we as Americans help them, when we show compassion and grace, when we evidence our truth that we are the United States of America, one nation under God indivisible, that is when we are stronger, that is when we go from an already great America to an even greater America. Now let me tell you, let me tell you right now, when Trump spews insulting and demeaning words about our fellow Americans, I think of that poem by Maya Angelou, you all know it, you know how it begins. You may write me down in history with your bitter twisted lies, you may trod me in the very dirt, but still like dust, I rise. Well y'all know it, y'all know it. This, this, this captures our American history 240 years ago, an English king said he would crush our rebellion, but Americans from around our nation joined the fight from bunker hill to the Battle of Trenton, they stood and so many fell, giving their lives in support of our darel or dareling declaration that America we will rise. This is our history, this is our history, escape slave knowing that liberty is not secure for some until it's secure for all, sometimes hungry, often hunted in dark woods and deep swaps, they looked up to the North Star and said with a determined whisper America we will rise. Immigrants, immigrants risking their lives in times of sweatshops and child labor, they organized labor unions and devoted themselves to lifting the tired, the poor and the huddle masses. With fiercest of grit they shouted so all could hear America we will rise. King pointed to the mountaintop, Kennedy pointed to the moon from Seneca fall to those who stood at Stonewall Inn, giants before us said in a chorus of conviction America we will rise. My fellow Americans, my fellow Americans we cannot fall into the complacency or indifference about this election. Because still the only thing necessary for evil to be triumphant is for good people to do nothing, you know the saying my fellow Americans we cannot be seduced by citizen about our politics because citizen is a refuge for cowards and this nation is and must always be the home of the brave. We are the United States of America we will not falter or fall we will not retreat or surrender our values we will not surrender our ideas we will not surrender the moral high ground here in Philadelphia. Let us declare again that we will be a free people free from fear and intimidation let us declare again that we are a nation of interdependence and that in America love always trumps hate. Let us declare. Let us declare so that generations get unborn. Can you hear us? We are the United States of America. Our best days are ahead of us and together with Hillary Clinton as our president America we will rise. God bless America let us rise together. God bless America.",

        "transcript": " I'm going to start with you, Ms. Franks. I believe you said the government has the right to participate in expressing its viewpoint. Is that what you said? Yes. Okay. I don't respectfully, Ms. Franks, I don't think that's what we're really talking about here today. We're not talking about the public. I don't think that's what we're talking about here today. I don't think that's what we're talking about here today. We're not talking about the government expressing its viewpoints. What we're really talking about is when the government pays and uses taxpayer dollars to fund these entities that we're talking about here today that actually discredit some of these news sites and drives away their advertisers. Do you think that's fair as well? What is fair as for the government to be able to fund projects and organizations that do certain things with those funds that may include competing in the marketplace of ideas and they may be winning in the marketplace of ideas. But the government is not making those choices. And when certain news outlets lose in the marketplace of ideas they may want to blame the government for that, but maybe they're just losers. So, okay, Ms. Franks, do you think... It's actually Dr. Franks. Ms. What's up? It's actually Dr. Franks. Okay, Dr. Franks. Sorry. Ms. Yonis here said that when she was looking at these entities and the organizations that they had blacklisted, every single one of them was a conservative leaning organization. Do you think that's fair as well? Is that okay? Dr. Franks. It was a different name, so I wasn't sure you were talking to me. Yeah, I'm still talking to you. I'm still looking at you. I'm still talking to you. Would you repeat the question for me? Yeah, you seem to have a problem paying attention to the questions being asked of you today. I'll repeat it for you again. Do you think that it's okay that these entities that are blacklisting companies, all of the companies on the list that are blacklisted are conservative outlets? Do I think that it is okay for a company, for a nonprofit organization to develop tools that offer rankings? In other words, offers speech of criticism, critical speech about certain businesses? Yes, I think that's okay because that is protected first in the minute activity. So you think it's okay for the federal government to be using our tax dollars to basically, through a proxy, blacklist can one side of the aisle. You think that's okay? I do not because that is not what is happening. Really? How so? Then why are all the companies on the list, the blacklist, conservative groups? I think that's something that conservatives would need to answer. No, I think that's something you need to answer. I have to answer it in any way. Because we're talking about censorship here, and there's only one group of people being censored. No one is being censored. Misunis here admitted that she's not even a Republican. She leans left. Yet she's telling us that all of the companies on the blacklist are conservative groups. How do you square that, doctor? I don't have to square that because, as I said, the folks... I know because you don't have to make any sense. Do you need to answer the question? Yeah, go ahead. The first amendment has certain principles and certain rules. People may not like them. People may disagree with them. People may not like the fact that someone out there may say conservatives are all bad, or liberals are all bad. The correct response to not liking that is to engage in your own speech, as is often happening here. It is not to say, oh, this is censorship or being a silence. It's simply to say, we disagree with what's being said here. Try to compete, and if you are good enough, maybe you'll win. Misunis, what do you have to say about what Dr. Frank Sheiss said? First of all, I want to be clear that this wasn't just about NewsGuard and GDI. The government was funding hundreds, at least 300 tools and technologies that were designed to censor speech. Some of them weren't even pretending to censor foreign disinformation. Quote disinformation, of course, that's a subjective term. They were hosting COVID disinformation challenges where they were giving grants to companies who showed that they were the best at censoring COVID disinformation. COVID is not really a national security or foreign topic, even if it had some tinges of that. This was about the government using its authority. The government can't use its authority, can't use its power, and can't use its money. In order to censor views, it doesn't like. The government has a right to express its own views, but not to use those views to censor. That's where it stops. And the court expressed that in Vulow recently, actually. Mr. Wangart, I'm going to allow you to comment on this exchange. I just say briefly, we've heard a robust defense of the government's purported right to speak, which as we've established really looks like a right to censor. And the censors, portrayed as the victims here, but American speech on mass has been censored by the censorship industrial complex on a slew of issues that expressly reflect protected political speech. And if a stop isn't put to it, we're going to lose this right in Toto. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will back. I'm used back and I recognize your name.",

        "transcript": " Okay, thank you for that Mr. Gill. I now recognize Mr. Crane from Arizona. Thank you Mr. Chairwoman. Thank you to the guests for showing up today. Many Americans ask me all the time, what is wrong with this country? Why does it appear that we've gone mad? And I think this subcommittee hearing is a testimony to what has actually happened. And I know I hold some beliefs that, you know, you know, they're my own beliefs. They're not everybody's beliefs, but I tell them all the time, this is exactly what happens when you allow God to be pushed out of everything. This is what we're seeing, because God has clearly spoken about this. In Genesis 5, 2, he says, I created them male and female. And what's really going on up here in DC is just a microcosm of culture. We've lost our minds, we've pushed God out of everything. And it's one of the reasons why it appears that we've gone mad. And one of the reasons we have two beautiful young women here who are here to testify about how they've been abused in sports by biological men. And none of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have asked you guys a single question. Have you noticed that? They don't care. They don't hear you. They claim to be the party of women. We got two women sitting right here and they could care less that you're here. All they want to do is sit here and try and deflect and talk about how we're trying to bully transgender kids. And none of us are trying to do that. As a matter of fact, I feel sorry for a lot of kids that grow up with gender dysphoria. It's hard enough to grow up as it is, let alone taking that on and having to deal with that. But that's not why we're here. They don't want to acknowledge why we're here. We're here to protect young women in women's sports from biological men. Most of the men, real men that I know, who came from good families, they were raised to protect women. It's something that we're all taught to do. We have clearly failed to do that as a culture and a society. And this hearing is a testimony to that. I want to ask you, Mr. Layfield, did you grow up in a family where your parents taught you to protect women? Absolutely, sir. My parents are here with me today and I'm proud of the lessons that they taught me. They absolutely have to protect women. Great, great, thank you. Then why aren't you doing that, Mr. Layfield? Why aren't you protecting women? Because we got two sitting right next to you who will tell you that not only are you not protecting them, but you're depriving them from participating in sports and everything that goes along with that. Why aren't you protecting women? So from a fencing standpoint, it's one of the safest sports in the Olympic movement. I know that you think swords present some kind of danger or no, we're not talking about swords. We're talking about biological men and you know it. Don't try, don't try those games with me. We're not talking about swords. We're talking about the fact that you and other men and officials in authority have failed to protect young girls and it's pathetic. It is pathetic. I'm not gonna sit here and try and convince my colleagues on the other side with biology or anything like that because they're long gone. There's no study that I could show them that would convince them that what they're doing is wrong. I'm asking you, why have you not protected young girls like these two sitting right next to you? Sir, I believe we have protected young women and fencing and it's one of the biggest things. Okay, really, hold on a second. Let's ask the expert witnesses. Miss Turner, have men like Mr. Layfield protected you? No. Are they protecting other young girls from biological men participating in sports? No, he glorifies it. Miss McNabb, are men like Mr. Layfield protecting you and other young women participating in women's sports? Absolutely not. Do you feel safe? No. You shouldn't because guess what? God created men and women differently and I know that this town and many in this culture have a real problem with that but it is a fact. Okay, it's just a fact and you guys know it. You have permanent injuries for the rest of your life. Is that correct, Miss McNabb? That's correct, Congressman. Evil triumphs when good men and women do nothing. Not only have you done nothing to protect these young women but you've actually sided with policies that are destructive to young women's sports. You said you have a daughter, Mr. Layfield? I do, sir. That's sad, man. That's sad that you wouldn't protect young girls from what's going on in this culture and it's disgusting to listen to these posts that you yourself posted. I can't believe that you're still the chairman of this organization. I really can after hearing some of those posts, calling parents who are concerned about this type of leadership, KKK members, are you serious? Shame on you, bro. I yield back. The gentleman yields.

        "transcript": " Here to discuss Arizona Republican Congressman and House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Andy Biggs is back, welcome back, sir. Thank you and good to have you back, Kennedy. So you guys, it looks like you're going to have two Democrat senators from what has been a solidly Republican state. So what's happening in Arizona? Why is the president having a hard time and why are Democrats really capitalizing on that? Well, we have had the demographic changes you pointed out. I mean, we're right next door to California. And a lot of the people who come here at true refugees, they want to get into the Arizona lifestyle. They're going to vote conservative Republican because that's where they are philosophically. But we get a lot of people who come over, they like the cheaper cost of living, they like the fewer regulations, lower taxes, and all of that thing. But they vote like they're still in California. And that becomes a real problem. And so I always say, we're glad to have you here. Please vote to keep us Arizona instead of turning us into California. I know they're having the same problem in Texas. Beto or Rorck almost won that Senate seat. And Ted Cruz obviously prevailed. And now it looks like Joe Biden could win Texas. This is all crazy. Now, you've got different states. So the message changes slightly, but what do conservatives have to do to reappear to those voters? I was talking to Ben Dominic about it a little bit at the top of the show. Is there an identity crisis within the Republican Party? And how can you shore things up and win again? Well, I think in Arizona, we're poised now. I think we're going to have a good outcome of this election for red. But the reality is we have to keep the spin. Do you think Mark McSally is going to win? I think she has got a real legitimate shot. I think President Trump is going to win by three and a half. And if he does, I think Martha McSally wins very narrowly. But I think she can win. It's very close, very tight. But I think it gets to the point of expanding the base. And what we've seen here is, is minority voters, whether Latino or Blacks voters, they are actually embracing the Trump philosophy. And that is one of freedom. They like that. They associate with that. They liked the opportunities that were coming. They liked everything with their first step back to the opportunities. If we expand that base, I think that we can keep Arizona red for at least another few cycles. I'm surprised it has taken this long for Republicans to reach out to non-white voters. And they've always taken for granted that Latinos and Blacks don't vote Republican. And hopefully your party will see that people are not monoliths. They are not part of mindless blobs. And you're absolutely right. You have to appeal to individuality, freedom, and success. Because everyone wants to be a part of a boom. Everyone wants the rising tide to lift their boat, especially if that boat will someday become a yacht. No, that's exactly right. And I think this president, when he was campaigning in 2016, and what he has done since then, you saw the tremendous low unemployment rates, the opportunities, the actual wage increases. When people feel that, they do understand pocketbook, politics. And that's why I think you can expand the base. And I think that's why he's expanding the base in Arizona. Well, we will see. But Wayne endorsed him in the Platinum Plan tonight. Does that resonate with voters enough to push him over the top? We'll see Congressman Biggs. Thank you so much. Yep. Thanks, Kennedy.",

        "transcript": " Thanks for joining us on Fox 10 News, Mick Roussand, a pleased to have with us today. A guy who we have not spent a lot of time with on this program. In fact, I believe this is the first time that Andy Biggs has been on this program. The newly-minute Congressman from District 5, the East Valley. Good to see you. We're talking Mesa, Chandler, Queen Creek, your hometown of Gilbert. Much of the East Valley replacing Matt Salmon, who retired. Good to see you, and thanks for coming in. Good to see you. Thanks for having me. It's gonna be great. You've been in now, what, three months, four months almost? Yeah, a little over three months. How has that transition been going from where you were in the Arizona Senate, you were Senate President, the House before that, the Arizona State House? How did that prepare you for this job and what's been the biggest surprise so far on Washington? Well, I think it prepared me in the way that Congress works, because it's a law-making body. It's a self-governing body. Everything is done through the committee process. So I know how committees work. It's familiar to you. Absolutely. It's the familiarity. We get bills, we read legislation. You know how to read the legislation. And so all of those things are very familiar and have made for a mostly easy adjustment. But the other aspect to have a too is, any legislative body you're gonna see people act and respond in certain ways that are very familiar and similar as well. People are gonna put pressure on you in certain ways. You know how to respond to that. Turn about lobbyists, constituents, all of it. Lobbists, constituents, leadership, the leadership. Other members of your conference, you've seen that before. You know how to respond. I feel much less respond. Yeah, that's a good way of saying. Much less over when I feel much more comfortable than I think I would have thought going into it. Is it functional? You know people have talked about the dysfunction in Washington. Do you think the Congress is still functioning even though it may be messy the way it should? I do believe that. People forget that the purpose of Congress is to have filters so you don't just spit out a bunch of bad ideas. You wanna filter out bad ideas. And when we say it's functioning, what you're seeing is, I think the healthcare thing was the perfect example of how it functions because when you get there and you say, well, this is gonna have a problem. And people, both from the moderate side, people from the conservative side, kind of ended up, even though they were at odds, over why they said, wait a second, we've gotta put a break on this. And you are part of the freedom caucus. That's about 60 members who are extremely conservative. Would you agree with that? I don't know if we have, I don't know what, no one knows what the official number is, but we're conservative. And if you were to describe to somebody, you're sitting with somebody flying home from Washington next to somebody on an airplane and they said, so you're a congressman, tell me about this freedom caucus. What's the deal? What are they about? Well, I think the freedom caucus is a great place for people like myself who say, look, we want to be effective. And in Congress, you have to have groups in order, I mean, this is really the truth. You have to have some groups together to have lever. Strength and number. Exactly, because everything is done by committees and coalitions and caucuses. And so this is a caucus that gets together. We actually debate the merits of bills. We read the bills, we debate the merits of the bills. We talk about solutions. We try to find out how can we make this bill better? Or... So in the case of health care, what was it that you said, I cannot buy into this? Was it just the fact that it would not bring costs down? Yeah, let me just say this, the freedom caucus never took a formal position on that. Everybody was basically an agent to themselves, but we discussed the very thing you talked about. Will this bring costs down? We actually brought in experts to freedom caucus from both sides of the fence to say, tell us what this would do. And they gave us that information. For me, I don't understand this in some ways after saying that a lot of this is familiar, but what we're talking about is a president who said, we need to repeal Obamacare. We're talking about Mitch McConnell who said, we need to repeal Obamacare and tear it out root and branch. And the Republicans, before I got there, put out a pamphlet saying, you can't untie the knot on this. You must repeal everything about Obamacare. Well, the bill didn't do any of that. The bill saved a lot of it. It saved a lot of it. You kept the framework in place. So it didn't go far, nearly far enough. Yeah, for me, I want to be able to go back. So I admit that I'm asking for the perfect, which is a straight repeal, oddly enough, a bill that has been passed in Congress a number of times before, at least out of the House of Representatives. That's what I said was the perfect. Then they say, don't let that be the enemy of the good. Fine. The next best thing would be the 2015 bill that passed out unanimously by Republicans in the House and the Senate. It appears that you may be inching toward that goal right now. Health care is not dead, reforming or repealing Obamacare and trying to fix it if that's what it may end up being. You're still moving in that direction, quietly. Is that correct? That's correct. And so what you're seeing happen is there are negotiations, well, we've been off on this work recess. There are negotiations that are happening daily. Is the administration involved in this? I'm not sure where they are involved in it, but I do know that you're getting groups within the conference. I know leadership is kind of acting as a facilitator in some ways. Where groups are coming together, they're talking about, can we get there here? Do you believe you can get there? Do you believe that this will still happen? Oh, I feel very strongly it's going to happen. Whether it gets to the point where I can vote for it, I don't know. Because the devil's in the details. I mean, we need to see what's written. We need to know exactly what's happening with it. Let me ask you, you just came home this week. You had a town hall. Was it the first town hall you'd had since you first in person town hall? We had done two teletown halls. A lot of folks in your situation had kind of avoided the in person town hall because they were becoming unruly and out of hand and really uncivilized. And then you guys got chastised for not meeting with constituents face to face. You got hectored a bit at your town hall. Mainly over climate change. That was the biggest thing in the night when you said, you know, I'm not sure about this stuff. I have doubts. You got a big groan. That tells me that the makeup in the audience is probably liberal. Are these, is it liberals coming to the town hall, hassling you? Or is it conservatives to the right of you, which would be almost impossible because you're pretty far right? Well, John, let me tell you, in this particular event, I give kudos to my staff, Mesa PD, the church that let us hold it there. It was a big venue. Right. About night, seats 950. But only 600 or so came. And of those 600, I would guesstimate. Roughly two thirds were against me and a third were for me. Against meaning, Democrats? Democrats? Yeah, I don't know what, yeah, I would say. They certainly weren't organized. Yes, and yeah, I would say it certainly seemed organized to me. And we've seen some of the social media that went out afterwards and they said, well, we need to organize our chance better. So when we call them coward, we need to all be shouting coward together. We need to... Oh, you've seen this. We've seen this. Yeah, we've absolutely seen it. And so... I mean, it's there right, by the way, because you represent... Absolutely. And Republicans, even though you're a Republican, you represent that whole district. That's right to say what they want. Absolutely. My goal was to be gracious and welcoming and smiling, embrace it, lean into it. How did it work? How did that work, doing that, taking that approach? I felt pretty good. You know, of all the questions, I mean, people said, well, they didn't ask all... We didn't get that time to ask all our questions. Well, the reality is, well, there was only one person that I knew was from my supporters who were there who asked a question. She got booed while she was asking the question. But I was smiling and welcoming, and I thanked everyone. I didn't... And I'm sincere when I say this. I'm glad that we could do this. But actually, at one point, somebody stands up and yells, quit smiling. I'm like, really? We're glad to have you here. Let me ask you about a couple of things in the news. Obviously, let's take... Take number one. Missile strike, Donald Trump orders in Syria to take out the airfield. A couple hours north and east of the capital of Syria. When you saw this, what was your reaction? I had a lot of mixed feelings the way I think most Americans did. I think we were all horrified by the use of chemical weapons by Assad. By the same token, we don't want to insert ourselves so far that we get drawn into this conflict, which is a civil war. You're worried about that? I am worried about that, absolutely. I was reminded of the early 80s when President Reagan undertook similar actions and unilaterally with regards to Libya. And so, my thought was, okay, I get it. We finally have a strong president who's doing this, who's taking this very strong action, setting a marker. The context also comes into play. You had Assad and the Russians who had previously said, we've eliminated all of you. So, chemical weapons. And then you have Trump meeting with the Chinese president at the same time this is going on. Is that by design or is that just a happy accident, but it seemed to send a message? I agree with you. It's sent to a real message because it wasn't long after that. The 150,000 troops moving to the North Korean border and China's border moved back and stood down. I think that it was a probably a happy coincidence, serendipity in some ways. But Congress has the power to declare war. The President is the commander-in-chief under the Constitution. There is a War Powers Act, which is meant to bridge that, but is the constitutionality of that can be brought into question. So do you believe he should have gone to you guys and said, here's what I'm planning to do, I need you to sign off on it. I was at the hands of the President. Oh, absolutely. At hands of the President, it was meant to do that because we're the people's representatives and it was to determine Venice from getting to kind of a military who into type of thing. So I wish that he would have come to Congress. I understand why he didn't come to Congress. But I do think if any further action in that arena needs to come to Congress. Okay, so let's take tape two. Now you've got a bomb landing today as we're taping this on Thursday on the Afghan border, right in the near the Torah Borough region where Osama bin Laden was hanging out after 9-11. To try to break apart these tunnels, this super bomb, Moab, the mother of all bombs. Do you think the President should have come to you about this? This is a little bit different context in the sense that we've already been engaged in military conduct in various places in the world against ISIS. The issue that we, so on this specific action, I'm not sure that I would say he needed to come to Congress. But what I would say is if we're going to take, make acts of war against even ISIS, even though it's a non-state, act, or non-traditional adversary, I think we need to basically make the case to the American public that we need to be at war with them. And we need to go to Congress and make that same case. And if we do what has to happen at that point is we pull our resources, we pull our resolve and our commitment to make this a priority like no other. It's interesting because Congressman, when I hear you speak, this is the argument Democrats have been making. The President needs to come to us about this stuff. He can't just kind of go off on his own and do this stuff. Well, Democrats weren't making that under the previous administration. What I'm suggesting is, look, we have military forces throughout the world. And I don't believe in America's world policeman strategy. I do believe in America as protect our security interests, which is exactly what President Trump, Donald Trump, candidate Trump, was talking about on the campaign trail. Absolutely. Now he's taken a step into these incursions that maybe, I think a lot of people, even people of Otofor, maybe did not anticipate. I would agree with that. I mean, we look back and see, what did he say in four or five years ago when President Obama was considering what to do? He said, don't do it. Don't do it. And President Trump promised, I'm going to be the President of the United States of America first. Right. America first. And so I think the distinction with what I heard his explanation in Syria is, he was trying to make a case that this was a critical national security interest that we were protecting. And it was a measured response by attacking infrastructure. Now if that's the case, then that's very limited. He's still under the War Powers Act. He's got to come back to Congress and explain that and justify that. The President making this decision without congressional approval. If you do that, you really telegraph to the enemy what you're about to do. Well, that is correct. And that's what War Powers Act was designed to allow. But the question you have to ask yourself is, was that action justified unilaterally on the part of the executive branch? And you say, that's where I've, you've asked, I've vacillated. So because I look at it and say, I think that in this instance, I can justify it. I can justify it because of all the context that you and I have just talked about. But by the same token, you really can't do much more than that. And how do you do much more than that is you come back to Congress, come to American people and say, here's why we have to do this. We're going to take a break, quick break on Newsmeekers Sunday. When we come back, we're going to talk about the border wall, the chances of that actually happening. Trump tax reform, where does that stand going forward? And this idea of sanctuary cities, we're going to talk about that in war with Andy Biggs, new congressman from District 5 in the East Valley of the Greater Phoenix area. Back for Congressman Biggs in a moment on Newsmeekers Sunday. Back with Congressman Andy Biggs. He won election first term to Arizona's fifth congressional district, replacing Matt Salmon, who retired. Boy, that was a nail-biter of an election. You won by 27 votes over Christine Jones. Yes, in the primary. Did you think that you had lost that race at any point? Did you think you would lost it or did you, did your people on the ground say, not so fast, I think you're going to win it when it's all counted? Well, I will just tell you, the night of the party, the night of the election we had a party, my wife and I were the only two that we felt like we were going to win. And in any event we'd done all we could. Even though you were trailing that night. Yeah, we were trailing it on. We were on election night. We thought Christine Jones' lead would probably hold up. Well, here's to be very honest about it. We thought it would. Well, our polling data, our pollster was very clear to us. He said, look, everything tells us that she will win the early ballots. But you are trending in the day of. And we think, if you work hard and we get the kind of turnout that we think we're going to get, which by the way was far more than we anticipated. Which I think it means a huge difference because we were probably 8,000 people below where the turnout actually was. Right, in my feeling that night. And usually this is in the case. The early vote when it comes in, that separation, it may close or widen a little bit, but generally who's on top when the early ballots are counted, usually ends up prevailing. Well, what we did is we... This was really kind of different. Yeah, it was different because, but what we did is we got that message about a week into early validings. And we said, we're changing our message. And so we went out and changed our message. And what we felt we needed to do is we needed to not even talk about our opponent, no contrast, nothing. We're just going to talk about me. So people would know who I was because that was the deal. People who knew who I was, positives were very high. But we felt like we didn't have enough people that knew who I was. So we need to get out. So people knew who I was. I believe Christine Jones has a future somewhere. Yeah, I think so. I think so. She's old for two running for office right now. But a lot of people feel she's got a lot of game. Where would be a good fit for her? Well, I've always felt that if she's going to run for Congress, she should run in the district in which she lives, which I think she would be a formidable opponent there. I think that she's quite frankly, you mentioned I'm a pretty conservative guy. CD5 is a pretty conservative district. I think that her political philosophy probably fits much better in CD9 than doesn't CD5. Let me roll tape number five. There's been all this talk about the border wall. One of your colleagues in the Arizona Congressional delegation has said that he wants environmental impact studies on effects on species with this wall. I'm talking about Raul Grihalvo, of course. There seem to be a lot of roadblocks already kind of going up with this. Do you believe this will ever come to fruition and will it look like anything Donald Trump described during the campaign? Well, I don't know how beautiful it will be. My sense is it'll end up like this. You can see through, right? And because even border agents want to be able to see what's on the other side. They don't want some wall that they can't see through. Well, so the wall that's up behind us right now is very similar to the wall outside of Nogales where it's these tall slatted. It's fortified. But what's interesting about it is when I've been down to the border and I've talked to people who are monitoring the border, they will say, I say, how long does it take to get through that? They said, oh, you can get over and down. I think it's five or six seconds of that wall. I think that you're going to see it a wall. I think you're going to also see increased technological barriers. I think you're going to see the need for roadways and easements along that border fence. I do that it could be patrol more readily. Absolutely. It absolutely. Some of the topography makes it impossible. Well, it's possible to build a wall just like it's impossible to actually cross through there. Right. So, yeah, I would go from Macallan to San Diego. Right. And you've got the reservation there. That's also a problem. They're not going to put a wall up on the reservation. Well, so here's the, so I've met with the Tijuana Odom of reservation leadership a couple times now. They don't want it. They don't want to miss anybody in the public. They do not want a wall. But I have suggested that you'll never get a better time to leverage what you want that wall to look like than now. Well, and furthermore, they may not want a physical wall, but they do not like what's happening to their native lands with the dogs, smugglers, and the people coming through. Right. They don't. And they also don't like the technological towers and stuff that are out there monitoring. And I think they need to have, they have border entries, stations already on their reservation. And I think those need to be modernized and updated and more efficient for them as well as roadways and easements for them. Let me roll tape number six. I'm bouncing around a little bit, but Donald Trump has said we're, and even your speaker, Paul Ryan has said we're going to move on to tax reform. Even though healthcare is quietly still kind of noise in the background, you're still working on it. This is Ryan's previous talking about where we are with tax reform. Take a listen. Moving forward, the president's vision on lowering taxes for every American is what's going to unite, not just the Republican Party, but I think some of those Democrats are going to come on board as well. If we can provide one of the biggest middle class tax cuts in the history of this country. Congressman, some people have said if you can't get healthcare done, tax reform is going to be even tougher. I disagree with that. There's a part of me that we should we would have done tax reform first. It is a, it's an easier sell to certainly the entire Republican conference because what we're talking about impacts individuals, including the middle class, reducing their taxes, providing opportunities for them. Also reducing the highest corporate tax rate in the world. To stimulate the economy, these are things that we, we basically universally within the Republican conference believe in. And if you believe in Arthur Laffer and all these other people, this is what will reap benefits almost immediately if you do this. Yeah, and I think that not every, not the Laffer Creative doesn't work on every tax, but when you start talking income tax and corporate income tax in particular, it does work. And it happens typically within a year to two years. And you would see that and we anticipate and I think the economists that I've talked to and heard give briefings on this, it could raise the GDP by a point or so, fairly and fairly short order. That's a trillion dollars more into the economy. We're going to take a quick break here on Newsmaker Sunday. Congressman Andy Biggs from CD5 in East Valley, replacing Matt Salmon, won a tight election in the primary, won easily in the general, we're back with Congressman Biggs right after this. A lot of moments with Congressman Andy Biggs, we've been inundated by this video all week long, the sky on the United Airlines. Jet, hold off the flight. This was ugly. Is this something Congress now needs to get involved in to protect the passengers, which by the way, and I remind people on social media, we bailed out as taxpayers. These very airlines, United was a big benefactor. And this is how they thank us. Look, I'm not sure the Congress needs to get involved because they're already heavily regulated. These contracts are there. What happened here that was highly unusual is the physical confrontation, right? Which, you know, so much could have been avoided if the airline personnel would have just handled this, I think, quite different. You think you guys might weigh into this to try to protect people, give consumers, try to protect the consumer a little bit. I don't think that that's the right rule for Congress because I can tell you this already airlines are supposed to provide that compensation if they're going to bump you. Right. And if they just give the right price, somebody will take it. Somebody will take it. I mean, that's a free market. Yeah. And we'd be far less expensive than losing what was it, 1.5 billion in one trading day for United. Oh, absolutely. To me, this is just kind of a, an unfur, highly unfortunate situation because this guy's dragged off. Yeah. And also what have taken was probably some, some, maybe, maybe you need some better training to do. You know, thank you, Congressman. Thank you. We appreciate it. We got to have you back. Thank you. Okay. And thank you for weighing in on that because everybody's talking about it. We'll see you next week on Newsmeckers Sunday. Thank you. Thanks.",

        "transcript": " House Freedom Caucus, Femma or Congressmen, Andy Biggs, going to the right-hand. Congressmen, it's always this conundrum you guys are in, right? To win over guys like yourself, some of your moderate counterparts then walk away. How bad is this divide if you want to call it that? Well, I think you're seeing as normal legislative process. And you've got it right. People push, it's a push me pull you so you pull some people on, you push others off. But I think there's actually, it's really close to having a conversation coming to completion. There's some things I'm not happy about. I'm still trying to see if I can get some stuff in there to make some changes to make it, at least simulate a repeal if you're not going to keep the promise on repeal. So I think they're going to get something done next week. I think we're going to get something done next week. All right, something done on the healthcare front. That's what you saying get that done and voted on next week? I believe so. I'd be kind of surprised if it didn't come out next week. Are you mad at Speaker Ryan? And do you blame him for any of this? I'm not mad at anybody actually. I do think that what we've had to do is squandered. You guys are always mad. I'm mad at my dog sometimes. I chew my shoes, but you know what? But no, I'm not mad at anybody. But I do think it is, it'd be wildernessing sometimes when you think that we had the strongest negotiating position that Republicans had had in a decade. And we could have done a straight repeal. Let's just do it and get it out early on. And we didn't quite get it done. And we started negotiating against ourselves. And we continued to negotiate against ourselves today. That's bewildering to me. Congress, do you need a healthcare vote in place and approved to proceed then with the tax thing? Or do you get to a point where you say, we're going nowhere fast on this healthcare repeal and replace. Let's go right to Plan B and that is a tax cut. I'm not sure you actually have to have it, but I do know that some people are trying to use it as funding for some of this tax plan that they have. And so that's really the issue, I think, and that's the bear in the woods on this. Many of the President wanted to get a deal on this healthcare thing by the time he would be looking at his underday. But tomorrow, obviously, that's not going to happen. And many are seeing on the fact that despite his busy and blitzkrieg fashion and meeting with CEOs and executive memorandum alike, there's no shortage of effort on his part in that regard, but no legislative win. Obviously, they leave out Neil Gorsuch, which was a big win getting him on the Supreme Court. But what do you think of that? And the propensity to the media now and others to say his first 100 days have not been that great? I think that's a false narrative. First of all, I think the 100 days deadline is a false narrative in and of itself. But he started it, right? I mean, he did say that he was going to get cracking right away, right? Well, I mean, every President has a 100 day plan, but I mean, you get Neil Gorsuch, which is a huge win, number one. Number two, what the House has done is we've passed 17 straight repeals for a regulatory constraints in this system. In history, that only one had ever been done. So, I mean, those are big wins. He has signed those. I think the fact that he's introduced this tax plan and we're going to be working on that, that's big. I think the anti-regulatory schemes that he's engaged in, the legislatures engaged in, what I heard is it's already produced $80 billion in savings to the economy. Those are huge. They're just not getting reported. All right, Congressman, thank you very, very much. Enjoy the beautiful letter. Good seeing you.",

        "transcript": " MUSIC Coming up next on Arizona Horizon, a visit with two newly-electored Arizona congressmen, Republican Representative Andy Biggs of Congressional District 5 and Democrat Tom O'Hallarine of Congressional District 1. Arizona's newest congressman next on Arizona Horizon. Arizona Horizon is made possible by contributions from the Friends of Arizona PBS, members of your PBS station. Thank you. Good evening and welcome to Arizona Horizon. I'm Ted Simon. State Senate President Andy Biggs got a promotion last month. He was elected to represent Arizona's 5th Congressional District, vacated by Matt Salmon, joining us now to talk about his new job, Congressman-elect Andy Biggs. Welcome back to the show. Good to see you here. Congratulations on your win. Thanks Ted. Good to see you. Have you been back? How many have you been back now since you've been elected? Four times. Four times. From what you've seen the difference, and I know there's a lot of differences, but the clear difference between Congress state legislature? Well, it's bigger. Yes, there's more... They have committees with more members than we have in the entire state Senate, I mean, it's big, bigger issues in some respects, but not any more important, but somehow bigger. And I think it's easy to see how some of those folks get caught up in the bubble of Washington DC. How's it going to say, what surprised you most when you went back there? What did you see in here that you didn't expect to see in here? I think first of all, well, there's two things. Number one was just seemed like everywhere we went, there was media watching, which is really unusual. We do a lot of work in anonymity here, and I'm okay with that, but there's more media. The second thing is you can really get a different vibe. I mean, the vibe before the election amongst Republicans was a little bit, I don't want to say Marose. It's kind of, there was not this enthusiasm or exuberance, but ever since November 8th, there's been this sense of excitement on the part of the Republicans in the House, and even in the Senate that I've talked to. As far as working with a president-elect Trump, what are your thoughts on that? Well, it's better than working with a president-elect Clinton in my mind, but I'm hopeful that we can get some of the policies done that I ran on, and that I think that coincide with what he has said that he wants to do. I want to get to those policies in a second, but Trump is always the 900-pound gorilla in every room. Right now, there's talk of congressional investigations, possible Russian cyber attacks, into the election. Would you support such investigation? Well right now, there doesn't seem to be any evidence. There's a lot of great rumors out there, but there doesn't seem to be any evidence, and I would really want to see something solid before I would say, let's jump into this. CIA saying that Russia was involved, is that enough evidence? Maybe not. How come? Well, they don't want to disclose what their evidence is. They're just saying, here it is. Well, why are you saying that? And what is driving that? And I think that's important to get to. If you have party leaders, both in the House and Senate, the Republican leaders saying, we've got to look into this. They want to see it bipartisan. Would you go along with leadership's ideas, or again, do you need to see more for yourself? I want to feel comfortable that if we're going to open this up, that there's something there. I think part of the thing that bothers Americans, at least in my district, when I was talking is that sometimes Washington does things regardless of cost, regardless of thoughtful look at things. Sometimes there's some knee jerk reaction. And I think we want to make sure that we're on top of this thing by seeing whether it really is evidence. If there's evidence, then yeah, maybe we need to do that. But I want to make clear, you would be concerned if evidence showed Russian interference in the election, whether it's interfering for or against either candidate. I'd be concerned if anybody was interfering with our elections, whether it's a foreign government or a hacker sitting in a basement of his house. I mean, yes, I'd be concerned. First order of business for you, back in Washington. I promised on the campaign stump that I would introduce six bills. We're already working on the outlines of those six bills. And I think we're going to be revved up to drop those bills, as I said within two or three weeks of being elected. Any ideas on what those bills are? Any ideas of telling us what those bills are? Yeah, I'm happy. I told the public. I told the public. I'll tell you. First one is Congress isn't produced a balanced budget in decade. And so Congress shouldn't get paid, shouldn't get their recess until they do their job. And so that would be one of the bills. Number two is the regulatory burden that we have on the country costs almost two and a half trillion dollars a year. Oddly enough, that's their national debt's too tight. So the Reigns Act, I'll support reintroduction of the Reigns Act. Go ahead. Let's stop right there. As far as regulations are concerned, we hear a lot of regulations need to be decreased. Can they be decreased too much? Well, here's what you're looking at. I mean, you're asking me a real simple question. You would think it, I can just say, what yes or no. But in reality, there are constitutional constraints on what the federal government can do and what it can't do. And that's an article one section eight. I mean, that tells us what Congress can do. Congress is essentially delegated its lawmaking authority, unconstitutionally to these agencies who go out and regulate. My point would be simply this, we need to bring that back to Congress. Congress has an obligation constitutionally to oversee it. And that's where we need to rest the regulatory environment right there on Congress itself. We're beholden to the people who elect us, not like a bureaucracy who's not. Okay. Fourth bill, I think, ripped out number four. Yeah, we could be three or four. Okay, I can't. Well, we'll work on that. A common core and federal education mandates, we need to eliminate those. Number four is the implementation of grants law in Maricopa County alone over the last 18 months or so. We've released from the feds almost 4,000 violent criminal illegal aliens. They should not be released into our city streets anywhere in this country. So that's what grants laws about dealing with Grant Ronnebeck, I think you're familiar with his case. Number five is Congress exempted itself from some of the laws with regard to Obamacare where you close that loophole. And then number six, which is one of my favorites is to create a new 12th Circuit Court, remove Arizona from the ninth Federal Circuit, put us in the 12th Circuit with Arizona, Idaho, I'll see you're Nevada, Montana, Utah, the Mountain States. The Mountain States, in Alaska, yeah. You mentioned the Affordable Care Act. Let's get to that. Will you vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Yes, I will. I know that that's one thing my voters wanted and I believe that that's necessary. The Affordable Care Act, though, is like the inside of a baseball filled with strings and rubber bands that need to be pulled apart can be very tricky to pull them all apart, but yes, I'll vote to repeal it. If you could pull them all apart or could pull apart as many as possible, would you do that without a replacement? Well, I don't like to think of a term of replacement because I think Obamacare was such a bad idea that you don't want to replace it. I think what you want to do is have an alternative market-driven plan. Starting from HSAs and FSAs, flexible savings accounts to looking at what's going on with health insurance companies driving costs, portability of insurance, these are things that we should be looking at as well. Preexisting conditions, provisions there. There needs to be some acknowledgement that there needs to be a high-risk pool. I mean, every state has a high-risk pool, even in their own Medicaid systems, and Arizona was no exception, and we need to be aware of that as well. Provision for a 26, folks 26, an under-to-remain on their parents' plan. Should that remain? I look, as a guy with kids who are in that bracket, I find that a dubious necessity. Really? Yeah. Explain. Look, they're not even required to live in your home if they're under age 26. Well, I happen to have a bevy of kids in that age group or have had a bevy of kids. You know what? They don't need to be on my health insurance plan. We've heard from the Arizona Hospital Association and others in the medical field here in Arizona. The $25,000 would lose coverage if the Affordable Care Act were to be just gotten rid of without a replacement of any kind. Hospitals would suffer multi-billion, $3 billion in the first year. And since 2010, it sounds like Arizona's the uninsured in Arizona that's dropped from like 17% to 11%. All that they say is reason that you simply cannot with a stroke of a pen or a yavote or a naivote get rid of Obamacare without something reasonably in place, whether it's an alternative or something in place. Do they have a point? Look, I don't want to get into their numbers and their data, but I do think that the point is really clear. If you, something that has been as massive as Obamacare has been, it needs to go away. It needs to go away. It needs to go away. The reality is, if you just repeal it and leave this ball bouncing somewhere, you're not going to be able to, let's just face it, the Republicans are going to get to blame. You should shift it from the Democrats right over to Republicans. So Republicans better have some ideas for alternative proposals, whether they be market-based, market-driven, which would be my approach or whatever they may be. They need to have something, an alternative. Speaker Ryan, we're running out of time here, but now Speaker Ryan was saying that he wants the House to ease up a bit on waging what he called symbolic, but empty fights. Does that make sense to you? Well, yeah, I've always been a big believer that you choose your battles and you fight those battles. And sometimes a symbolic battle is just as important as a more substantive battle. But by and large, I've tried to build my idea of a policy advancement through the idea that, yeah, you choose your battles and you go after the ones that need to be changed sooner and you fight them vigorously and try to win those. Has the gravity last question here? Has the gravity of this position sunk in? I think it has begun to sunk and I think it would be naive for me to say, yeah, I really get it. But I mean, I think that you begin to feel the weight. It's pretty weighty. All right. Well, congratulations again on your victory. Good luck and we hope to hear from you again soon. Thanks for being here. We appreciate it. Appreciate it. Have a happy holiday. Thank you, you too. Thanks. All right. Part discussion with recently elected Arizona Congresswoman continues now with former state lawmaker Tom O'Hallarann, who was elected to represent congressional district one, which is vacated by fellow Democrat and Crick Patrick. We welcome Representative of Elect<|ja|> Tom O'Hallarann to Arizona Horizon. Congratulations on your win. Well, thank you very much. I really appreciate the citizens of congressional district one putting me in the office. Why do you think you won? I think my message was to the needs of the district. It was orientated around jobs, making sure we had health care, and basically making sure the families in the district improve their life. I know land and water issues are big in that district. They were big in the campaign. Talk about your vision there, and especially how that vision coincides with environmental concerns. Well, as you know, my history in Arizona is water and forestry issues have been a big part of my public policy input. I feel that in district one, the forestry issues are important to our economy and important to the long-term liability of the five national forests that are in the district and the Grand Canyon. And as far as water goes, we have the Conor Ratter River in the district. We have salt river in the district. So this is an important issue for the entire state and the Southwest. I know in the campaign you said you would protect coal-related jobs. How would you do that, and how do you also protect against carbon emissions? Well, you plan for it. You just don't come into communities and say, we are going to take away all the best jobs in these rural communities, and you people we haven't even consulted you. I want the people of my district consultant. I want a national plan to do this, not just a haphazard plan. And I believe that Congress has not done its job of debating this in Congress. They have allowed an agency to take steps that I think it needs to go through a congressional rule for a process. Would you vote to kill the president's clean power plan? Well, I think that the new president is going to have to do that on himself, and he's going to take that plan and not go on through Congress. I want to see it go through Congress. Well, there are two resolutions last year in Congress. The House did just that. They voted against the clean power plan. I mean, if that were to come up, how would you vote? Don't know yet. I don't see what the plan would be. If it did not include those elements of making sure communities are made whole, making sure that there's a national policy on power, and making sure that we are not just closing plans for the sake of politics versus then what's going on in the rest of the world, then I would vote for it. What about the president's plan for a Grand Canyon area monument? Controversial could come up for a vote. I would vote for that. I vote for Ray Sonoleta in of support. Okay. So for those who say that it's too much, it takes too many jobs, and it takes too much opportunity away from not the Grand Canyon itself, but the Grand Canyon area up there, you say. I don't know what jobs people are saying that it's going to take away. The battle industry is protected, the only thing that does not allow in that area is mining. And hunters are protected, and in fact it protects a watershed and it protects jobs because of tourism in that area. You know that you're going to get a very vociferous argument on the other side and it's going to come very often from the president on down now. How effective can Democrats be on Capitol Hill getting things done? Well I think that people are rushing ahead of themselves in this whole thought process that Democrats are going to be irrelevant. Within the Republican caucus, there's already people talking about things that they don't like within the president's plans. I see a caucus at one time or another is going to fracture along some lines and some issues. Then that allows the opening for Democrats to negotiate. I was going to say we talk about the Affordable Care Act a lot because it looks like it's headed for a fall. Although, again, President-elect Trump says he's not going to do anything without a replacement plan. Your fellow representative-elect Andy Bigg says, well, not a replacement. It's got to be an alternative. You can't just get rid of it. How do you plan to fight for the provisions in the Affordable Care Act? Well the provisions that are in there are some of the cost drivers that are affecting the plan. And so what I said in my campaign is I want to take a look at those cost drivers to see if they're needed, they're relevant, and to improve the plan, not to do away with the plan. And when you talk, all of a sudden, it's easy to say things on the campaign trail about doing away with the Affordable Care Act. It's much harder when you're affecting families and the lives of our citizens. And that's what we're talking about now. Now reality is at the table. And reality says you need to find something to replace it, and it has to be something that allows those citizens and more citizens to be able to afford health insurance. Republicans say there is something out there. It's market driven in general for the most part, market driven. Could you live with something like that? I haven't seen a market driven- we're here because of market driven insurance. And the fact that we had an Affordable Care Act because it wasn't being taken care of. And whether it's, you take a family in poverty that's above the line for excess in the state of Arizona, Medicaid. And they don't have the resources for a savings plan, a medical savings plan. They don't care about a tax credit because the tax credit, they don't pay taxes because they're under a certain level. And a family of four making $40,000 a year, they can't afford this health insurance. Whether it's the Affordable Care Act or other concerns, you mentioned working with Republicans. There might be some opportunities there as perhaps Republican caucus fractures in ways that we can't even imagine right now. The campaign you were quoted as saying, we are at our best when we are united. The country does not feel united and Capitol Hill does not feel united. Washington doesn't. How do you get that unification to happen? Well, I don't think we are united right now as a country and politically. And how you get to do it is I'm part of a freshman class of Republicans and Democrats and we just came back from a Kennedy School government where we dealt with policy. And one of the things those that were at the school said was we are going to work together. We are going to meet on a regular basis. I joined a group called the New Dums. We work with Republicans, put our hand out and say, let's work together on these major issues affecting the citizens of Arizona and the United States. So you don't do it by taking jabs of people by just saying, you know, they are wrong. You do it by working together and creating public policy that's for the betterment, not political betterment, but the betterment of society. But I can hear Democrats and critics saying that's all fine and dandy, but it's one thing to say I'm going to work with Republicans. It's another to say I'm going to work with Republicans when they won't work with you. Well, it's impossible to work with somebody that refuses to work with you. And they have to show that they are willing to work. And if they're not willing to work, we still have to look at the policy that comes out. I don't know what Mr. Trump is going to put out as public policy. Nobody does. I know what I've heard. I have some very serious concerns about some of his nominations and so forth. What's the biggest concern of what he's done so far? Anything on foreign policy. I mean, I've never in my entire life seen a president of president elect start to get involved so much in foreign policy. You take a look at the statement he made on Twitter again today about the F-35, which is important to Arizona. And Lockheed Martin lost $4 billion at one point during the market today. I mean, that is just not the appropriate thing for somebody. It's not involved in our foreign policy yet, and not involved in our procurement system yet, defense yet. Do you think that there is a smoking gun that shows that Russian hackers tried to intervene in this election cycle? I'm not any intelligence committee and probably won't be as a freshman, but I can say this. If there is the hint of it and there is, then we should look into it. We should not allow this type of thing to go on answered. We have to make sure the integrity of our electoral system is kept intact and that no foreign powers are able to do what could have been done under the circumstances. The likely number two of the State Department, John Bolton, is saying that the Democrats, the Democrats, could be responsible for hacking into this election because of a false flag situation. In other words, you do the dirty stuff and then blame it on your opponents. You buy that? John Bolton said a lot of things over the last number of years. I don't buy it. And Mr. Bolton didn't offer any proof that this occurred. So until you offer proof, and that's why I think the bipartisan group has gotten together and said, let's take a good hard look at this together and make sure that we know what we're talking about. Up until now, whether it's myself or others out there, until you get the investigation done, none of us really know what we're talking about. How did your orientation go? When you first went back to DC and they were shuttling you around all over the place? Well, shuttling you around is true. That went great. I enjoy the look into the future of beginning congressman. I enjoy the debates that we had meeting other congressmen from both parties, making sure that we started to develop our offices and our staff and starting to get a foundation built to, in my case, represent Congressional District 1. And I've got a good Washington staff already on board and part of my district staff is on board. Has anything you didn't expect? Not really. I mean, I just think it's scale. Yes. And the awesome responsibility that you've taken on to make sure that when that scale has developed that way, that we do have a competent staff, that we do make sure that constituents see work is taken care of. And at the same time that we do our homework on public policy. Planning of scale, Congressional District 1, is huge. It is mammoth. You're five hours away by playing just from the district and then to cover the district, you're going to have to do a lot of travel. How are you going to represent all of these people from so far away? Well, tomorrow we start our trip through the Navajo Reservation and then on the way back, start doing some of the cities and towns in northern Arizona. And then the next day we go into the eastern part of the state for two days. And then the two days after that, we go down into the southern part of the district. And we will continue to make these rotations through. I told the citizens of Congressional District 1 that I was going to be at their meetings and I am going to be there. And last question I've been asking is if all of our Congress people, especially when they first get elected, has the gravity of all this sunk in? If it hasn't, you better not have taken the job. This is serious work. And you need to take it seriously. And the awesome, that awesome responsibility, you told people that you're going to represent them. They might disagree with you at times, but your job is to make sure you know the facts. And that is going to be something that's going to be a challenge on a continuing basis. All right. Well, again, congratulations. Good luck to you and thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it. Thanks, David. Appreciate it. And Tuesday on Arizona Horizon, we visit with Democratic Congressman Ruben Garnett. We're the guy ego of District 7 and Democratic Congresswoman Kirsten Sinema of Congressional District 9. That's tomorrow 530 and 10 here on Arizona Horizon. That's it for now. I'm Ted Simon. Thanks for joining us. You have a great evening. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Today, we tragically lost a tremendous leader and a friend. We didn't lose him so much as he was taken from us. Charlie Kirk was an inspiration to an entire generation, and I believe that his legacy will grow. He will be remembered as someone who changed the course of this nation. He was the founder of one of the most influential political movements of our time. We live in an interesting time. We see political movements, President Trump, as fostered the Magga movie, perhaps the most powerful in the history of the country. But Charlie Kirk, let's just talk about what he did in Arizona, and then we'll talk about his most important contributions. He founded an organization, T.P. Turning Point, USA, and a whole affiliate of related turning point. And they're headquartered right there in Arizona, and he was just absolutely remarkable. So in Arizona, it was about a ground state, right? What did they do? In our state, turning point action together with other coalitions actually turned out more than 300,000 low propensity Republican voters, right? What's the difference? The difference was it made there, Donald Trump win Arizona. It helped Donald Trump win Arizona by the largest margin of any battleground state, 160,000 votes, a 5% five point victory there. So he fostered a movement, but he did it foster the movement because he was smart. He was erudite. He was passionate. He was generally calm. He took on all the cameras, and I'm afraid to talk with anyone about his message. So, while we consider this movement, we know that people in his generation and younger are actually moving to the right. And a lot of people say they're moving to the right because they've been disassociated by the left. They've been disillusioned by the left. And I think there's probably some of that to it, but they don't move to the right unless there's an invitation. And so he invited people to come. To share his love of freedom, family, faith, God, and country. So Charlie will be an historic figure. He really will be. And he will be one more, and along line of those who are good, whose life is snuffed out by those who are evil. But his memory will remain strong. And I would suggest that the most important role that Charlie filled was as a loving husband and a father, and about Christian who shared his faith unapologetically without fear, with tremendous courage, charisma, and compassion. My family invokes our thoughts and prayers on behalf of Erika and Erika Charlie's two young children. We pray that God covers them with peace and gives them the comfort of the Holy Ghost. I think I want to just close David with a couple of things. There is, we always say there's no place for political violence in this country, and there should not be. This assassination was meant to instill fear. It was an actual assassination, a political assassination. So what must we do? Well, we certainly speak peace and truth and comfort, but we respond with courage because the message Charlie brought was there is a good way this country has much to offer everyone. So we will double down. We will reinvigorate and restart our engine and those who want to destroy this country, whether it be because they want to destroy our faith in God, whether they want to destroy our freedom, whether they want to destroy our education, David, you mentioned then. We will persevere because there is much to be learned from this young man. And so I say with my family, God bless you and your family, Charlie. God bless the entire TPUSA team who are in mourning grieving. And God bless the message of freedom that America stands for. David, thank you. Thank you for letting me take a moment. I'll see you back.",

        "transcript": " Hello everyone, thank you for being here. I want to thank Speaker McCarthy and the whole leadership of the conference for these amazing seven months as I started my journey in Congress every time people asked me, you know, how's it going? It's going. It's fast and we've been making a lot of progress and I'm very happy about that. Also, Ken say that I'm not happy about going home today. It's always good news and for me, going home keeps me informed, keeps me connected, and it keeps me married as well. So that's always a good thing to do. But I'm proud of the work that we've done, I'm proud of the work that we've delivered as a conference. We all ran on different promises and in my case was one of economic opportunity, the freedom to pursue the American dream and the way that we are safe and we continue to keep our commitment to keep our community safe. And that is what I want to talk to you just a little bit about today. My border is a border district, as you know in South Eastern Arizona, and border security is a big piece of our daily lives. And the relationship with Mexico specifically is a big piece of our daily lives. I was born in Mexico and I immigrated to the United States when I was 11 years old. Became a United States citizen in 2006 and was elected to Congress in 2022. This is the land of opportunity, no question about it. Don't know where else in the world could we have this kind of story and opportunity. With it comes the rule of law though. With it comes responsibility to protect our borders from those trying to do harm to us. And there's a lot of cartel activity that you know about. And they've been dominating the traffic on the border, the legal traffic for a long time that is hurting the positive, by cultural and also trade relationship that we've had with Mexico for so long. Who is our ally and our friend. These cartels and this illegal activity have taken over the trafficking of both drugs and women and children and overall people across this and that must be stopped. And that's exactly one of the pillars of my campaign when I ran for office. And of course that was a pillar of what we had to do when we set out the plan to our commitment to America. So with that I want to just say that we are keeping our commitment to America by delivering on the safe nation and with that came HR 2. This was a build that it seems now that it was passed a long time ago and may seem that way because of all that we've done in between. But this is an important piece of legislation that highlighted the priorities that we have both to secure the border and add resources to that and also reform loops and gaps within the asylum system that has been so heavily abused. Also, while protecting on the company of children. That was a big point for me and that was something that I have to give a lot of credit to the leadership for giving me a seat at the table as a freshman as someone that wasn't in any of the committees that were moving these bills forward but I still had a real seat at the table. I'm being able to give our thoughts and opinions both of my personal experience and also my professional experience working on the border. So I am proud of the bill that we put forward. Also I've been assigned to the task force on the cartel task force. This is we've been meeting for a couple of weeks now getting expert advice and we're going to be setting out a plan as we look deeper into the cartel activities and how legislation from Congress can help tackle that problem as well. The efforts around fentanyl can be overstated. We've set this before that every border has become a border state due to the fentanyl crisis. My home county of Pima County now is the home for the leading cost of death among young people being fentanyl overdose deaths. That is tragic. That has surpassed now car accidents and unfortunately there hasn't been a positive curve on that yet because of this administration's failure to tackle the real problem, both secure the border and tackle the problem regarding the cartels. Also providing strong support to our military might district this home to over 70,000 veterans. That's a 9th largest veteran population in the country in terms of congressional districts. I'm proud to represent two military bases and DM Air Force base in forward Chuka. Like I said, 70,000 veterans living in our community that we've been able to advocate for as a member of the veteran affairs committee as well. And then as the leader and others have mentioned today passing the military construction and veteran affairs package. Very proud of this one. Proud of what we've been able to do and hold the line and the funding for our veterans but also up it even more and make sure that they have all the needs that they need. Also correcting the record on whatever lies were said about our efforts or our intent to cut anything on veterans. That's absolutely not the case and we prove that by making this the first appropriations bill. And speaking of appropriations, I am proud to be appointed to the appropriations committee and serve on that this entire time as the only freshman in this class to be able to do that. The only member in the Arizona delegation and I want to thank the leadership speaker McArthur and and and and leaders Gilles and Tom and just everyone Stephanie everyone because they've given me that opportunity to be on there and represent and carry the voice of our freshman class in the appropriations process. As I said, we're heading all back home today. Proud of the work that we've done by knowing that there's a lot of work to be done and the time at home it's a work period where we get to go and talk to people and listen even more. And you know the only way you can actually be happy to go back to 115 degree weather is to be leaving 100 degree human weather here in DC. So with that, thank you so much for your time and I would like to turn it over to my friend representative Mary Ned Miller and Beeks.",

        "transcript": " For what purpose does the gentleman from Arizona rise? Madam Clerk, our rights nominate Kevin McCarthy is speaker of the House. The gentleman is recognized. Thank you Madam Clerk. The American Dream is a dream. The American Dream is a dream worth fighting for. And I know in my hearts of hearts that Kevin McCarthy is the man to lead us as we work to fulfill that dream for everyone. And every state and every district. Everyone in this chamber understands the need to serve our constituents. It's who elected us and our responsibility. Kevin understands this as well as anyone. He has dedicated his life to spreading opportunity for all through the private sector and the public sector. This place is a special place for me. My first time on the hill was back when I was in the end of 2003. My mom visited and I remember walking around the halls of Congress as if I owned a place. Just a few days ago, I got to walk my mom around one more time, this special place. But now, as a member elect of the United States House of Representatives. The American Dream is alive. I believe it. I've gone to know Kevin McCarthy well. He's a curator of Republican majority in the United States House and laid out a plan to deliver for the American people. There's one thing that I know about Kevin McCarthy. He cares about the American people. He cares about our country. And is here not to be somebody but to do something. And that has been laid out in his commitment to America. To fight for an economy that is strong, a nation that is safe, a future that is built on freedom, and a government that is accountable. This, I can strongly get behind. This country gave me and my family an opportunity, an opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Friends, I was born in Mexico. The best way that I can tell you who I am is through a short conversation I had with my dad. When I told him, I was going to run for office. This conversation, of course, in Spanish. My dad asked me, Juan, where else could we have our story? We come to this country. We immerse in the culture. We learn English. We go through the long journey and become U.S. citizens. He said, I drive a bus my whole life. And now my son has a shot of becoming a member of the United States Congress. Where else in the world could we have our story? But where else in the world could any of us have our story? Regardless of our background, where we come from, what side of the aisle we sit on? We have the privilege and opportunity to sit here today as part of a historic moment, fighting for what we believe. The answer of where else is nowhere else. Only here. I trust Kevin to fight for that American Dream. Because he's a product of it. We're all a product of it. He gets it. And understands that a government accountable to the people is the best tool to ensure that our future generations continue to have a real shot at the American Dream. So let's be proud of our stories. Let's be grateful to God for it all. And let's get to work to ensure that everyone has the same opportunity to write their own story. Being a representative isn't a job title. It's a job description. The eyes of the world are honest as we are airing our grievances. That's the cost of leadership. The leadership that comes from this body. So let's act like it. Let's step up to that calling. That our country needs and our districts expect from us. I am confident we will resolve this issue and will stand united to fight for the values that matter to the American people. The American people who sent us here, to tackle inflation, to protect our border, to hold the executive branch accountable. It's time to do the job we were entrusted to do, to get results for the American people that sent us here. And the best person to lead us in this journey and in this fight to defend the American Dream for all. This is Kevin McCarthy. And I am proud to stand here before you today as the first naturalized citizen in the history of Arizona to win a congressional seat. Proud of the work of my parents, my dad, who drove a bus for most of his life, my mom, a homemaker. We grew up in the two bedroom apartment. They didn't own a home until I was in college. But my story is not unique. I wash cars with my dad in the same neighborhood that our office sits today. We're not here celebrating one particular story. We're here celebrating the American opportunity only found here being born from this body as well as the opportunities of our country have gone. In all of you in this room have that story. I strongly believe that we all have a car wash story. The story where we began. And in spite of all the challenges and spite of all the obstacles, we are here. And each one of us are a testament to the opportunity and the greatness of this country. And that is why we are here. And I strongly believe that Kevin McCarthy is the person to lead this body in this new fight, this next 118th Congress. So, at the direction of the Republican Conference, I advance the name of Kevin McCarthy as the next speaker of the House of the 118th Congress.",

        "transcript": " The governments of Arizona and Sonata have labeled this area as a mega region, a system of economies supporting each other. At a recent buy-nationals summit, the governments agreed to continue collaborating with one another, despite what's been talked about at the national level. I recently spoke with Juan Siscomani, his governor Doug Ducey, senior advisor for regional and international affairs. It's extremely important. Mexico is by far our number one trading part, times four. So it's not even close for the second one. When we look at the trade that we do with Mexico, we break it down in exports and imports. Over $8 billion is what we do in exports with Mexico. And just around $7.2 billion in imports. So we export more than we import in this relationship, Arizona wins. Just to put it in perspective, Mexico trades more with Arizona than they do with the entire country of Germany. So we are a key partner for them as they are to us. So the mutual, the combined, I would say, import an export relationship with Mexico almost reaches $16 billion for the state. Huge. It's responsible for creating about 100,000 jobs directly here in the state of Arizona, plus the indirect jobs that it does as well. So the numbers prove it. This is an important relationship economically and trade and also cultural that we have with Mexico. Some of the talking points that came out were the fact that regardless of what is happening on the national scale, it seems like Arizona and Mexico will continue to work together. Yeah, yeah. We will continue this. We're not turning back. We will continue the course. This has been the priority for the governor since day one. His first international mission trip was to Mexico City five, six months after he was in office, which is what opened the door to the kind of relationship we have now. At that point, Governor probably hadn't been elected yet. But as soon as she was elected, the governor gave her a call and that started with a great relationship, which became a partnership and is now a friendship. And that kind of relationship that we enjoy, we're not going to turn back on. It's important for the state, but it's also important for our overall relationship. The governor always says, as he says, relationship has mattered. And the stronger we keep them, the better prepare we are to phase the challenges. So the national environment and the national message that is going out there would affect us if we didn't have established relationships the way we do. How does the governor handle? We have a Republican president who's not particularly enthused about the relationship with Mexico, a Republican governor who's pushing for it. So where is that balance? Well, the governor is strong and believing on the role of governors and states. And each state sets their own tone with the relationship with Mexico. Because we have the ability to trade with them directly, which is great. So the governor has been very strong on keeping a positive and open relationship with the White House. At the same time reassuring our friends in Mexico that Arizona is open for business. We are open. We want to continue this relationship. And we want to continue to attract companies. As we've been attracting them from California and other states that we're competing with, we want to make sure that our companies here in Arizona have the ability to do business and trade with our companies in Mexico. So there's a very specific role for the state government to play here. The private sector plays a key role and they've done that and they've done very well. But there's also a point where we need the governor's input and leadership and platform to say, hey, we're open and that attracts business. Are there contingencies in place should NAFTA undergo some sort of change? Well, sure. What we trust is that we have a seat at the table with the White House as they look at this issue. The governor has been invited to different national platforms, big national platforms like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Woodrow Institute, Mexico Center. And he's being recognized and acknowledged and tapped as that trade governor. The governor has been able to, as you said, being from the Republican Party and maintained a good positive relationship with the White House and also with Mexico. Those are not mutually exclusive. We can keep a good relationship with both. And the governor has been very strong on promoting that with Mexico. And we hope that that's an example of what other states can do as well, especially as we carry on with Sonora, that is our number one and main partner within Mexico. But as we have the Arizona Mexico Commission, that's exactly what that is. The Arizona entire Mexico Commission. So we want to move also beyond Sonora because there's a lot of opportunity with Mexico. One of the big headlines that came out of the summit was the port of Rocky Point. Yes. How close is that to being completed? The port is about 50 percent done. This actually port was started by the previous administration in Sonora. It went through some trouble there and just was stopped for a little bit. But now they're continuing under the leadership of Governor Pavlovich. She has great relationships with her federal side as well. And that's what's helped speed up the port conversation. This is a great opportunity for the region of Lorraine because they are going to be attracting hundreds of cruise ships into that region. What that means is we're promoting the two nation, the destination. They can go to Rocky Point, unload the cruise ships there. Our people also can go down and catch the cruise ships there. But in the aspect of trade, Ermesea, which is the main capital of Sonora, the capital of Sonora in Main City, it's about six hours away from Rocky Point. Phoenix is three hours away from Rocky Point. So when they look at their supply for anything the cruise ships are going to need from tablecloths to service to any of that, they're looking at us to do that. So this is a great opportunity for areas on the companies to be suppliers for this expansion of the port. And then we signed an MOU with Sonora about this. The governor is committing to work together to co-promote this cruise ship port and formed working groups from transportation, tourism and economic development of how we can push this. Sonora takes that document, goes to Mexico City and says, this is the agreement we have. Let's speed up the money that is already allocated for this project because they need the federal input and finances to complete this project. But with the document that we signed last week, that's what they take over to say, we're getting there. Let's push this money down. Is the infrastructure in place though in Mexico and here in Arizona to sustain this type of commerce? Great question. There are several points there. First of all, the port of Lucville and Sonora, which is the point that we cross to go to Rocky Point. We've invested millions of dollars on the Arizona side to widen the lanes once across into the US side. Mexico sees that and Sonora acknowledges that we've made an investment and they need to make some investments on their side as well. The travel time to Rocky Point, it's over two hours on the Arizona side and a little less than an hour on the Mexico side. So the majority of the road travel is going to be on our side for Rocky Point. They have that investment to make, which is part of the request that they have for the federal government. They said the kind of agreements that the governors meet about and say, this is where we're at, how can we continue to push this forward? It's about to happen in Arizona that suddenly there's this push, there's this economic strength that's really by national to create cargo and commerce that's going to be flowing freely across the border. Sure. I think, again, it starts at the top with leadership of Governor Ducey and saying Arizona's open for business. This wasn't just a campaign slogan. It wasn't just something that we wanted to get people excited about. It's something that he's living day to day and the administration is fully focused on that. I can tell you by being part of a senior staff, that whatever we do, whatever lengths that we look at, the entire situation is going to be about, how do we create jobs? How do we improve workforce development? How do we improve education? How do we strengthen the livelihood of our citizens in Arizona? That message is out there. The governor's out there promoting it in California and other states, even in Texas, winning projects over to come to Arizona because of the good business climate, low regulation that we've been tackling. And quite frankly, the resources that we have by having Sonora as our good partner in the neighbor in the entire country, all that is just positive messages. And then we also have the policy to back it up. That's a very powerful combination that we enjoy in Arizona. This is our time. This is Arizona's time. No question about it and we're taking full advantage of it. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Leaders in Arizona remain optimistic about a new NAFTA deal, and in recent years they've made inroads with officials in Sonora and Mexico City. Senior advisor to Governor Doug Ducey Wants his comani told us how those gains are playing out in Arizona. The good news here is that Governor Poblovich has a very strong relationship with Mexico City, as we do with Washington, D.C. Now the advance that we have even on top of that is that Governor Ducey has developed a very strong relationship as well with Mexico City. Mexico sees the Governor as a friend and as someone that has been able to find mutual common interest and shown mutual respect and the conversations that are going on is how do we strengthen this, how do we expand this? We haven't taken our foot off the pedal. We continue to go fast at this and go strong because our economy very much depends on that with you're talking about almost 19 billion dollars in trade between what we deal with Canada and what we deal with Mexico. Will you talk about expanding things? What sorts of things are in place that you want to see continue to grow? Investment on the border and everything that has to do with the flow of goods across the border and the safe and a speedy way has been our priority. For example, we have unified cargo processing now in the gallows and all our ports in Arizona and that has really cut the way time for produce or anything else coming across by about 80% of the cut of time. The recent announcement about the sky bridge, how exactly does that work here in our state? Very similar to the unified cargo processing that we have at the ports by land. We have this now at the airport for air cargo as well. This essentially makes us the e-commerce hub for exports to Mexico and very soon Latin America as well. You're going to have US federal authorities and Mexican federal authorities under the same roof doing inspections for air cargo leaving the country. That's going to happen at Mesa Gateway Airport. What that means for Mexico is now they have availability for next day shipping on things they didn't before. Economically, can Arizona sustain NAFTA without the federal government's involvement? Well, it's very interesting question because we get that question often. What would happen if the United States pulls out a NAFTA or that goes away? We in Arizona have something very unique called the Arizona Mexico Commission. The Arizona Mexican Commission, as we call it AMC, was founded in 1959. So you're talking about 36 years before NAFTA was even signed into an agreement. We saw the value of the trade relationship with Mexico, which the AMC enjoys with 15 different committees from mining to agriculture to the arts, to social services, to the economy. So we had a trade in the relationship with Mexico before NAFTA. It has flourished during NAFTA and we hope that it's going to continue to get better after whatever comes out of this. And this is exactly why leadership matters so much because we really don't know what's going to happen. We can fully speculate what's going to happen. We feel in the administration pretty optimistic that the White House is going to see what they need to see. And so is Mexico City and so is Canada. And they're all going to be able to come to an agreement because it's something that benefits everyone.",

        "transcript": " I'm in an independent, I'm on this end, so I'm learning. And so I'm looking around at everybody. So my question is, what's your feeling about it? I think one, I think one. Yeah, I think she can help with the dance. I'll be sure to check it out. I'll just follow you some. You want to check it out? Sure sure sure. Arizona Congressional candidate Juan Siskamani catches a convenient bout of amnesia when approached with a simple question from an independent voter about his abortion stance. Fortunately, his team showed up in the nick of time to remind him that a woman needs help with the kids. Probably a woman forced to give birth to and raise a rapist kid, as that's now Arizona law. A reinstated 1864 abortion law that only grants exemption to women whose lives are endangered. Why wouldn't Siskamani be proud of the resurrection of control over women's bodies? When he want to brag about it to potential voters like the one in this video? Well, when a well-known Republican senator whose name rhymes with cringy spam gives the game away, that Republicans never actually wanted to leave abortion to the states. I think states should decide the issue of marriage and states should decide the issue of abortion. I think we should have a law at the federal level that would say after 15 weeks, no abortion on demand. And Democrats are still raw over the dobs ruling, pushing the pro-life agenda can be political suicide. So even though what Graham said is what Siskamani and others believe, they're begrudgingly staying tight-lipped in the short term to keep moderates and independence interested. It's pathetic and insulting to voters' intelligence and representative Alyssa Slotkin saw right through this scheme for power. Watch how she calls out their hypocrisy, especially when it comes to their loved ones and the beloved veterans. You want to ban all abortions, that is your goal. Many of you have been open about that. If you flip the house, we know that you will put forward a full ban on all abortion for all states. You've been clear about it. You want to turn a veterans bill into an abortion bill that's doing it. Not one of you are a medical doctor. Not one of you. What the VA guidelines say is that if you've been raped or the victim of incest or a medical professional deems that your pregnancy is a risk to your health. You've been a woman in this country who has had a miscarriage. Probably many women in this room that you are a better judge of who gets to decide the future of their life and not a medical doctor. Who do you think you are? You are politicians. We are all on this floor, elected officials and not medical professionals. If it was your wife, your daughter, who was suffering through a miscarriage, are you going to tell her she can't until her fever gets high enough until she's bleeding harder? That's what's happening in the state of Texas right now. If that's what you want for veterans, shame on you. Shame on you. So the deems get a win pretty close to election time and Republicans are pissed at the setback because maybe they could have had a lock on the House and Senate. The medieval hardliners are shamelessly calling Graham a saboteur of their evil plan. Why is Lindsey Graham 25 days out from ballots going out galloping in and saying we need a federal abortion ban. Really? Where have you been Lindsey Graham? That feels like election interference. And I say this as someone who is so pro-life, I would love a total abortion ban 15 weeks is not enough, but I'm also not dumb. You know, it's almost like he wants Republicans to lose. That's the conspiracies theory that I would actually subscribe to here. He wants Republicans to lose. This is a sabotage. It's the only way to explain it. But the large majority are cowards. There's a genocide happening in America under Roe v. Wade, the federal government recognizes a right to kill babies in the womb. I'm pro-life, but I oppose a federal abortion ban. Abortion is divisive and Tim Walls is weaponizing the issue. In Minnesota, it's a protected constitutional right and no governor can change that, and I'm not running to do that. If that's the decision, the court makes it possible for there to be votes at all levels of government and democratic bodies on this issue. In terms of scheduling, I think most of the members of my conference prefer that this be dealt with at this state level. I visited over 25 GOP candidate websites, incumbents and newcomers, and they're transparently suppressing their monstrous feelings. None of the major congressional candidates disclosed how they would use the government to take care of babies, half made no mention of their stance on abortion. The rest used ambiguous statements like, I will always protect the life of the unborn. Two candidates had donation paywalls to their websites, and another two bragged about how they're rated 100% by the pro-life version of the NRA, the National Right to Life. And now, Republicans are in lockstep with Hershel Walker despite written and verbal confirmation that he paid for an abortion for one of the mothers of his children. If Republicans backtracking didn't clue you into their ultimate motivation and feelings on abortion, this has to. Pro-life is and always was a political tool, a moralistic narrative to get Republicans ultimate power. Power to control women's bodily autonomy, where trans kids get to go to school, and who the queer community gets to marry. None of these fascists are obstetricians or gynos. The biggest losers will continue to be women and children, as no one in the GOP gave a second thought as to how they'd help women after childbirth. That'll just become the woman's financial responsibility. That's the worst part, but it sucks that diehard pro-lifers like Lindsey Graham don't lose favor with their voters. That the GOP cowards are deflecting, waiting out the shelf life of Graham's damage until they gain majority status across the board, and then can federally ban abortion. Or they're just raising and telling us it's all about seizing power. This has been the long game, the war they plan to win, even though they lost a pre-mitterm battle. And they're expecting us to believe a federal ban is the line that won't be crossed?",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Timing again when you're not necessarily on the subject matter here today with these particular projects, but the unnecessary requirement for a NEPA for simple things and my region for example Federal agencies will insist on what in my view are very unnecessary NEPA process in order to to effectively what would happen is delay or block minor forestry projects removal of roadside hazard waste etc Following fires we're talking salvage here, and so if anybody knows any about forestry you have a limited amount of time after fire to go out and get salvage of old timber. Oh, you got to do NEPA on that well, don't you already have enough processes in place for timber harvest plans and such that the NEPA is duplicative? Simple things replacing a covert. Oh, we got to do NEPA Well, the cost the delay in that especially when time is of the essence on a forestry project then you get down to simple usage of federal lands like Forest Service has a new requirement in in our neighborhood up there in Northern California on something has no impact on the requirement that would mean in in quotes then Riemel affects over the snow vehicle use snowmobiles We have to do NEPA on that now for writing on snow when it melts doesn't touch the ground so You know coming back to mr. Collier's issue here And I like you expound on what so you're saying to mr. costume for a little more if you wish um Did you expect a smooth process with this ahead of time before you dipped your toe in the water of this and contemplating a project or did you expect rough going with all the different alphabet soup of agencies and ideas of of how to proceed? Congressman, I've been doing this kind of work for almost 40 years and I spent three years in In the Clinton administration working on exactly this kind of stuff I knew this was going to be a very difficult project to move through the administrative process What I didn't expect is that we wouldn't be allowed to file a permit It never crossed my mind That for the first time ever someone in America would invest seven seven hundred and fifty Million dollars to get ready to go into permitting. It would be told that they couldn't do it So that part surprised me shocked me Um, I guess I don't understand what the chicken or the egg on this thing with uh, you know applying for permit and uh Not being able to start the process. It's it's it's it's it's to find a meeting There's a regulation that the corps has that says that once EPA initiates the 404 process That the corps is without jurisdiction to make a final decision or an permit and therefore corps of busy place in Alaska The Alaska Corps will not take the time to review and assess and do an EIS and invest all of that money If they can't make a final decision on it So they're waiting for EPA's final decision before so so we're in a position now where um, we practically can't file a permit We could have filed a permit before but there are a lot of issues that go into this permit decision um The first one is um, this is not just one project. This is a number of projects There's gonna be a power project. There's gonna be a port project. There's gonna be a mining project. There's gonna be a road project um, and with respect to every one of those There are a number of environmental challenges and we have to analyze them all and if during that process someone suggests an idea That we think deserves consideration. We stop the process and analyze that until we go forward The second thing that you need is investors to move forward Since EPA has initiated this veto. It's been very difficult for us to get investors to move forward So how do we get to a point where one stop shopping and we get this done? You have EPA doing the same thing you have army corps doing another Do we want lock them in a room and make them well? I get Until they come up with an idea of how a human being How a customer of the government is supposed to go about doing a simple request to do business I'd encourage you to find that room congressman. I'd love to I'd love to be in it but but I think that um, finding a way to work for people to try and get this done you got I agree with you guys but finding a way to enforce the memorandum of agreement That both the bush and Clinton administrations said to congress they would follow And that was uh that was negotiated pursuant to a statutory mandate to negotiate it 404j I think is a starting place. I think a second point is to the extent that the statute is unclear That we need to have a EIS done before a 404c decision is made. I think that would be helpful So there's a two places. I think this committee could have a real impact Thank you. Are you back this gentleman? yes",

        "transcript": " In the northeast corner of the state, California's first congressional district covers areas like Chico, Reading and Mount Shasta. Since 2012 voters there have elected a Republican, specifically Doug LaMalpha, a fourth-generation rice farmer now running for his sixth term in Congress. I've lived all my years just within a few miles of where we live right now. And my opposition moved up here from LA to take up residence here to come make an error of about me being somebody who I'm not. His opposition is newcomer Max Steiner, an army combat veteran who did two years in Iraq. Steiner grew up in Sacramento, moved around as a diplomat in the foreign service, then most recently moved to Chico from Los Angeles. He's running for office for the first time as a self-described moderate Democrat. January 6th convinced me to one register as a Democrat and to look at running for Congress. My opponent, LaMalpha, had previously spread lives about the election and then he voted against certifying. And I thought that was just completely uncalled for. Congressman LaMalpha joined more than 100 Republicans in voting against certifying the presidential election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Since he is raising this issue, do you believe that the election was stolen? No, but I think it's always appropriate to be asked questions about the way an election would be carried out. As far as his opponents concern over what happened at the US Capitol on January 6th last year. Making a whole campaign about January 6th is kind of like the fires that the January 6th Commission is anyway because our country were actually a public not a democracy. Wasn't going to topple over what happened that day. When it comes to policy, Congressman LaMalpha says, we got to get back to the basics. Store water, grower crops, harvest timber, manager forests, we don't burn down another million acres like we did last year and the Dixie fire, lose our small towns. Steiner also talked about wildfires. His brother lost his house in the car fire. We have a changing forest. We're going to have to do aggressive thinning. We're going to have to reintroduce prescribed fire appropriately. And we're going to have to really fund the forest service to do both of these things. A lot of that means restarting the timber industry. We kind of had a pendulum swing from clear cutting to no cutting and we really need sustainable forest management in the middle. On water, Steiner says building more dams is the answer. This is a storage problem. We with climate change, we're going to have longer droughts than between need to storm or water. But with climate change, we're also going to have more rain. That means we have increased flood risk. You don't flood when you have a heavy snowfall in this here. You flood when you have heavy snowfall followed by rain. And the only way to prevent flooding is through building dam construction. Here's what Lamalpha says. We need to continue to make the effort happen on adding sites reservoir out on the west side of the valley. So we have additional water storage, possible rays of shasta dam. Water storage is so much more critical. If we indeed have less snowpack and more rain, then we have to be able to capture the rain when it happens. Given the district's recent history of going Republican, Steiner admits this is an uphill battle for him. But this is a district that Democrats can win. We just need to run a candidate. They can win that kind of district. I mean, it's running a moderate with a good record. You know, they can convince those independent voters and moderate Republicans that, hey, it's time for change. Steiner believes he's the better candidate for the job. I think I care more. I'm going to fight harder. And, you know, like, I believe in the principles of America more than my opponent. Well, I think people know and understand my track record is on the issues that are important in Northern California. Lezé Mietri, KCR 8, 3 news. This US House seat is now one of 52 here in California. For the first time, the state lost one seat after the 2020 census data showed population growth slowed in the golden state.",

        "transcript": " Indeed, it's a very somber tone that we would be here on a very indeed sad subject matter as the 41st anniversary of Roe v. Wade is brought forward here in our history. I rise today in strong support of the sanctity of human life, and I know we have as a society an obligation to protect life in all of its forms, especially the unborn. We're confronted today by a culture that takes human life for granted and the sanctity of it. Indeed, we heard a little bit earlier that since the 41-year history of Roe v. Wade that's a decision made by a court, legislated by a court, that 56 million unborn have had their lives taken, which I think is really an uncomfortable injustice for our nation. I am a pro-life advocate. Regardless of the political or status quo, I'm proud to join my colleagues in protecting the rights of the unborn and preserving the right of the sanctity of human life. I am a Christian, father of four, have daughters, have sisters, have nieces, a lot of women in my life, my family's life. Of course, nothing replaces the great joy you would have in holding one of your own newborn or those of relatives or friends. What that means, the miracle that God has given us, watching them grow, watching them go on to become successful. How would you want to take that away? I don't understand it. Now, I know, obviously, it's a controversial subject, but we fall short as the country sometimes, is that a lot of times, many times, is that women are in a position to have to make a difficult position sometimes, that they may believe the only position they have is the termination of a pregnancy. But, at the very least, we ought to be able to stand here and make sure they have all the information on all the implications, all the options, instead of sometimes a rush to make what can be a very tragic and long-lasting decision. The fight goes on. It won't end anytime soon, but in the long-term picture, standing up for the rights of the unborn, as well as the sanctity of all human life, I think, is something that's essential if we're to have a belief system and something bigger than ourselves. I hope we as a nation can do better, and I appreciate that there's folks willing to stand forward. I appreciate those folks from the doctors that spoke here tonight that are there providing women's health and the health of the unborn and those of already born, that they have that perspective they brought to us as well. So, with that, I appreciate the time and I yield back.",

        "transcript": " Well, thank you, Mr. Newhouse, for your leadership on this and providing this time for us here to see you need to be able to talk about this issue in a very real and constructive way. And, you know, the ESA passed in 1973, I think, with a pretty strong bipartisan effort signed by President Nixon. Very well-intentioned at the time, as were some of the other protection measures that were put in place. And as we saw the other day here with the changing of the Lotus rules, the Water's the United States, over time, regulations can get out of control. They can be used for politics. They can use for controlling people. And for NIMBYism, for no growth and all that. And I think that's really where these have expanded into. And so our job is to provide oversight. Our job is to provide course corrections. Make sure the ship is on the course that was intended 40 plus years ago. And so the package of reforms that are being talked about by my colleagues and the bills that are being offered aren't here to gut the Endangered Species Act or to eliminate species. It's to bring back that course control, course correction that we're looking for. So, though it was signed 40 years ago, it is our job to constantly monitor and make sure it's working. We've talked about earlier, 3% of the species have been listed that were listed have recovered. Now, 3% doesn't give you a very good batting average, I think, in any league. So, that would be considered a failure. It's not because of lack of effort or lack of spending, certainly in my own state of California, or species have been listed. We have issues with fish, with delta smelt, with salmon. And yet, the trillions of gallons of water that are expended, flushing the delta each year to find a lower result. Only two smelt have been caught in their check traps in the last five quarters, I think. That doesn't show success, but it shows a lot of damage to the people that need that water for other purposes as well. So, let's find and focus on things that are going to be helpful to the species to be recovered and doesn't have to damage people in their livelihoods along the way. Reform is necessary to refocus the efforts of the federal government to help them recover more timely. One of them long time listed in Northern California, the Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle was listed for approximately 40 years. In yet in 2012, the Fish and Wildlife Service was saying, okay, we think it's time to pull that from the list, let's do the work involved to remove it from the list, because they'd seen some success in that time period. The beetle now has had the listing of the beetle, and an important part that we don't talk about enough is what's known as critical habitat. Critical habitat is any host, plant, or other vehicle for a possible endangered species that might take residents there. So, the bush itself, the Elderberry bush, any one of those basically cannot be touched, because it might be potential habitat for traveling Elderberry Beetle, although maybe not have ever been tracked in that particular area. Yet, every single bush, it's a battle, it's a fight. Now, why are we fighting over the bushes? It's because many of these grow in floodplain areas, on levees, that need to be maintained, rebuilt, upgraded. We have a lot of potential flood in Northern California, indeed, there wasn't so much potential as several times, we've had bad floods result, and I would mention in the Ube City Marysville area, two very big floods in 1996 and 1997, that happened from crumbling levees. Well, why don't they maintain the levees, because they can't. It's getting the permits, getting through the process, and then being able to forward it by the time you've done that with all the requirements that are put on to maintain this habitat, to maintain these Elderberry bushes in this case, makes it cost prohibitor for these local levee districts to be able to do their job. So what happens? Nothing happens. And so, in 1986, giant flood, hundreds, thousands of homes in 1996, and 1997 happened again. If the lesson wasn't learned 11 years later, 1997 happened again in the Ube City Marysville area, and at this point, three lives were lost in addition to all that other damage. Three lives lost needlessly, because we couldn't learn the lessons and get the permits done to get the levee weren't done. Why does that have to be? Because of roadblocks, because of endless lawsuits and slow moving bureaucracies that won't issue the permits and help with the funding that needs to get done, especially for what they have wrought on the costs. So finally, after all that was litigated, the government had to pay approximately $400 million in damages for the losses of life and property in these floods. Pretty disgusting, but still, every single bush is litigated as a potential for critical habitat, even though there may not ever be one of the species you're talking about, in this case, the Valdi Elderberry Longhorn Beetle that might potentially use it. So what happened with the delisting in 2012? Well, they finally gave up because of litigation and about how they do the sampling of the beetle. They said, well, we can't tell if it's the Valdi Elderberry Longhorn Beetle or the California Elderberry Longhorn Beetle that might be making these boreholes in the plants and in the ground there. So they just give up and say, we're not going to delist it anymore. Similar to the situation where my colleagues are talking about with the Wolf, with the Grey Wolf. You can find plenty of Grey Wolf all over the upper Midwest and those other states, yet the standard seems to be in the endangered species act, you have to find two or four mating pairs in every single county, otherwise it's still listed as endangered in California or where else. The rules have gone too far. So we need caps on the attorneys fees that make it not such an incentive for environmental groups to use this as a way to get paid, as well as a way to stop progress, stop things that people need. So I hope this package of bills at least can be a light and example of a direction where we're trying to take back to reasonableness and how the endangered species act is interpreted and used. Not abused, not used as a weapon, weaponized against what we need for flood control to save people's lives, water storage. If we're going to play the climate change game, then we need to be able to have more of these tools available to us to store water, right? So this would certainly help if we had more input from our local stakeholders on this who actually know how to get a project done. Finally, the Mary's Royal UBCD area they're talking about using local districts and local districts after a lot of roadblocks were overcome. So finally, the last bit, which is up to the Army Corps of Engineers, is going to be completed in that area of rebuilding the levees and putting the slurry wall in that's going to make them much less likely to erosion and blowing out. In 2020, the last piece is going to be done. If Army Corps stays on schedule, their own schedule, their own unique schedule. This many years after those two floods. So I commend the great work it's been done up to this point, but how many needless years of risk in these flood zones have to happen because we can't get out of our own way because of a permit or because somebody's interpretation of a critical habitat for a creature that doesn't even show up to these cram... ...it's critical habitat areas. I'm tired of fighting the fight against people that don't seem to care how it affects the people that they govern. So this is a true effort that everybody can see to reform this act into something that actually works for people, works for the species and gets a little better batting average than 3% recovery rate, which is pathetic, especially for the trillions of gallons of water that we lose to the Delta each year. The risk we have for people in flood zones, the high cost, the loss of potential, and the anguish all that brings. So I'm glad we had this time to be able to share this with the public that's watching and our colleagues that are hopefully listening that we can reform the act and still have it pursue the goals, making the endangered species that we talk about. Come off those lists because they're thriving once again. We have seen some successful examples, the bald eagle, so if I can see outside my window at my home and my rice field there, that's pretty tremendous. But we've got to get our batting average up, especially when you look at what it's costing society and loss potential and unfortunately sometimes and loss lives. So Mr. Newhouse, I appreciate the time and I appreciate it.",

        "transcript": " for the first time this week. We're able to sit down with California Congressman Daniel Malfa. You represent the district in Northern California, including Sisqueu County. Thanks very much for being with us, Congressman. Appreciate it. Glad to be on you. So it looks like you're home and safe. Can you describe what your week's been like? Well, certainly in the beginning of the week, we got sworn in for the 17th Congress on Sunday. And the build up towards what everybody's been watching for was on Wednesday, the counting of the electors in the House representatives, a joint session with the Senate, as you know. So as you know, there's much that's been contested about the election. A lot of questions surrounding how some of the states basically came down to six states that were going to be contested with the way they ran their elections. Four of those states were in that Texas lawsuit you've heard about in the past, too. And basically, it comes down to where the elections conducted properly in those states. And so the contention is that the laws that were changed, weren't really changed constitutionally, but done by a stroke of a pen by a governor, a secretary of state, or an election commission, and illegally done so in order to accommodate mailing every single address of ballots that has ever been registered before. That's what that boiled down to. So what if, when it came time to certify the results in the House representatives, there are six states that were being contested on that Wednesday? Well, Congress, I'm going to have those questions been addressed in courts and the jurisdictions where they were applicable and haven't those all been rejected? Well, to the satisfaction of tens of millions of voters know and to many of the members of the House, who the courts in the vast majority of these cases have taken them out due to technical issues or standing as one of the terms you hear or like that. So you don't have, there wasn't enough time in order to present the case. The case really did not get to be presented that well in a court hearing. So ultimately, it's Congress' responsibility to certify presidential elections anyway. So this is kind of the last stand in order to ask those questions about that in a public forum. Because many of us members were not satisfied with what had happened earlier with court decisions and state legislatures. Now, just a few days before this happened, the state legislatures started petitioning us to put the breaks on it, to delay the certification from the sixth for an extra 10 days. Senator Ted Cruz proposed that over on the Senate side, which would have been able to give a bipartisan commission plus five members of the Supreme Court an opportunity to sit down at our level and talk all these allegations to talk all the pieces to us, toss out what's smoke and mirrors and look at the things that were real on that and decide how big was the problem and what should be done about it perhaps. So that proposal didn't make it either. So obviously the result finally, at the end of the day on Wednesday, which got into Thursday, was the elector stood as the numbers that were originally purported. Are you aware of any proof of votes being altered or any fraud in any of those states where you were contesting the results or are you strictly concerned about the way in which the laws were addressed? My major concern is the way the laws were addressed. You hear other things about Dominion Machines, you see testimony that was done and I believe Michigan hearings. And so, you know, those are allegations that haven't been proven like you would prove a case in the court of law, for example, but there are enough there. There's hundreds of affidavits signed by people that I think they certainly deserve to have the time to present that. Those affidavits are sworn and so that their criminal prosecute, prosecutable if indeed they're lying about this. So it just brings up enough questions and certainly in the minds of what's the losing side was as fair was a clean election. And just the chaos that was put in place by within the last couple months for the election, deciding to have an entire country take on the system of a mail-in ballot that had never been done before in most of those states. We've done absentees. So we're talking about complete different things. Absentees and those types of votes, but entire states and not cleaning up the voter file. So we'd have so much confusion and just chaos in the way the voting. It's still not even done in one New York district right now because it wasn't done soundly. And so that's really embarrassing for a country that has all the high-tech and availability to do things cleanly and well. So that's really what the contention is. And so obviously we haven't had a chance to talk about this yet, but with the way things broke out on Wednesday, we were in the middle of the debate when people started attacking the Capitol. And that was a very hairy moment in of itself. Can you describe what that event was like for you? Where were you and how were you able to get yourself and your staff to safety? Yeah, thank you for that. We were in the House chamber that we were proceeding through the process. We were in the A states and Arizona was up and that was one of the ones being contested. It had a House member contest as well as a Senate member object. And that's what it takes as one for me, to house in order to then kick into two-hour debates. And that debate was underway. And so it only ended up Arizona and Pennsylvania or the two states that had a senator that objected as well. So those two debates were held. But during the Arizona debate, we got to notice that the Capitol had been breached on the first floor, it turns out to be. And they asked us to stop the process and hold for a while in the Senate chamber. So the staff that was working in the room there and peripherally to the Senate chamber were all asked to go into one spot and kind of wait out to see how bad this is going to be. Not long after that, they started asking us to leave the chamber and go to a secure location away from there. And as we're going out, we could hear the banging on the main back door of the chamber that would face the desk as you come in, like we're the president or other heads of state when they're invited to speak to the house. They come in through that doorway. That's the one where we could hear them beating on that door and breaking the glass out. Now, at one point, so much shouted out, shots fired. I reviewed the tape and I actually had my own. I turned my camera on while I was waiting to get out of the room because there was quite a crowd trying to crowd to the doors there. And it didn't sound to me like actual shots when I analyzed that. It sounded more of a rhythm of somebody banging on it with a stick or some other blunt object trying to break the glass out and get inside. Do you mind if he's still looking? Did you at any time fear for your safety? Not immediately. Obviously, it's a great level of concern, but we were following the directions that the Capitol Police and others were telling us to do. It makes their job easier and of course they want to keep everybody involved in the room safe, the members of staff and all. So I felt pretty secure in the process the whole time as they heard it is out of the chamber into downstairs and into the battles of the Capitol to where they ultimately took us. Were you surprised at the lack of preparedness by the Capitol Police and how easy it was for the demonstrators to not only breach the Capitol, but get so close to you and other members of Congress? Yes and no, because if you have a large enough mob unless you have just flat out have the National Guard there, I'm not completely surprised because we've seen that in the mayhem that went on in many cities around America during the summer and fall. There wasn't the police force there that could put it down in Portland and Seattle and Milwaukee and wherever else. And so we saw in Seattle they held on to those blocks downtown for weeks. And that might have been also dithering by elected officials on how to handle it. But what it boils down to is that unless you want to have the National Guard everywhere around every building that it's going to be a challenge. So I'm not going to get in line to place a lot of blame on the good job the Capitol Hill Police normally does. They have a tough deal going because they have an image also and they can't just start pulling M-for-M-sheen guns out and start shooting things like that. There has to be a decorum to that. So they have a tough deal and I think the calls to make them resign and such, I don't know, I think they need to have their day to at least talk about what they're allowed to do. Sometimes they're told to stand down. Sometimes they're told to do things. Were you aware of an order? Were you aware of an order at any level to have the Capitol Police stand down? I've only heard rumor that so far. And I don't want to deal in that so much as just when this all comes out and this is going to take time to hear, there was a shooting of a person in the Capitol there by the police and so people are wondering, why did this person get shot? So I would rather wait for the report and objective look at what has happened here. But what this points out is that we're going to have to have a much tighter security around that building and probably many others, maybe the Supreme Court and others to ensure that we can function because after this happened, several members saying well they're going to change their vote and change what they're going to do about having the hearing to begin with, about having this discussion. And so what does that mean? That means the mob has won in us not being able to do our constitutional business. And that's wrong. But the mob wanted you to contest those, if I may speak for the mob in this instance, the mob in fact wanted you to delay and or not certify those electors. So wouldn't the... Well, we have to figure out who the mob is. Are you of the belief that it was not Trump supporters who were in that mob? We don't know yet. Again, I don't want to be too speculative on who they are. It seems they've identified that some that are seen and Tifa rallies. I'm sure there was some that were pro Trump that went into building two, who broke what, who started what, we don't know yet. But if those that are wanting us in Congress to delay the process, they didn't get their wish on that. That was a wrong way to do it because it did cut short the debates and it cut short, excuse me, the whole process of contesting or talking about contesting those various states. So it wouldn't have helped that way. So the disruption, it doesn't matter who, what side or what group it is, the disruption was wrong because we are a nation of laws and of order and an orderly fashion of executing them and the process by we do government. So that's basically cheating that process for all law-abiding citizens when that happened. Carvesal Malfa, we appreciate your time today. Glad you and your staff members are home and safe and we appreciate your time. Thank you. Thank you, sir.",

        "transcript": " Thank you Mr. Sir. Gentlemen from California is recognized for five minutes. Thank you. Let me begin with the usual stipulations. This is the final amendment to the bill. It won't kill the bill or send it back to committee. When this is adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended. So there's no procedural reason to oppose this motion to recommit. Let's talk about the substance. Now we have heard a lot of debate this morning about the need to give big oil, the most profitable industry in the history of the world, yet another advantage. For years, Americans have been told that we have to drill, baby drill. The theory that we always hear is that we need to extract every barrel of oil from every acre of American soil to keep gas prices low and to provide, quote, energy security. But as soon as American gas prices started to drop, the curtain was raised and the truth was revealed. The real reason for drill, baby drill, surprise, surprise was to get big oil the chance to maximize their profits on the world market. It's not enough that they've been able to game the tax code for a century with billions of dollars of tax breaks not available to other taxpayers or businesses. It's not enough that they continue to enjoy access to our public lands and waters for oil drilling, even though they're no longer paying into the land and water conservation fund. The longstanding law that expired at the beginning of this month. As a reminder, for the past 50 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was an agreement, a compact, between the American people and big oil. It said that when we let oil and gas companies drill and profit from drilling in federal waters, they have to dedicate a fraction of the profits, just a fraction to protect our great outdoors for future generations. The deal is they have to dedicate a fraction of those profits to protecting our great outdoors for future generations so that our grandchildren will be able to hike and hunt and fish in our parks and wildlife refuges. The Land and Water Conservation Fund was allowed, shamefully allowed, to lapse at the beginning of this month and the majority hasn't scheduled a single vote or even a hearing to get it back on the book. No, all of these concessions to oil and the gas industry are not enough for this house. With today's bill, the house majority is saying that American oil and gas companies can drill more, export more, and realize even greater profits no matter the environmental consequences, no matter the consequences to health and safety. As presently written, the underlying bill, HR 702, would permanently ensure that no export restrictions for any reason could be implemented or enforced in the future. That's what this bill says. That is breathtaking in its devotion to the oil and gas industries agenda. Now, my motion to recommit would ensure that the President and Federal Government agencies charged with protecting human health, the environment and public safety, can continue to do their job that constituents rely on them to do specifically. With this amendment, we'll ensure that bedrock, health and safety laws like the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Act that laws like that will not be cast aside in favor of big oil's desire to sell more crude overseas. Now, if you think about it, this is a very straightforward amendment. So, I just want to ask my colleagues a question. Should crude oil exports trump the Safe Drinking Water Act? Should big oil profits trump the need for pipeline safety and pipeline inspection? Of course not. We need to protect Safe Drinking Water. We need to ensure pipeline safety and so, my colleagues, I urge you to vote yes on this MTR to improve this bill and I yield back.",

        "transcript": " I'm presenting Southern Sonoma County and Marin County in the state legislature for the past five years. I'm an environmental attorney by training. I was a senior attorney with an environmental group called the Natural Resources Defense Council. Before I was elected to the legislature, I'm a bit of a novelty when it comes to serving in the legislature. I think I'm the first professional environmentalist that has ever been elected. We have all sorts of other professions represented, but it's been a great honor to bring that distinction. And it has enabled me to work on a lot of good environmental issues over the past five years. I chair the legislative environmental caucus and am very actively working on. And in many cases, passing bills that are building our green economy and promoting green jobs and promoting energy independence. And doing other things that I know are so very, very important to us to our values and also to our economy all up and down the North Coast. I am running for Congress and tomorrow I am actually going to make my formal launch of my campaign. I hope many of you will join me online. We're going to do this by Facebook and email and other social media. So if you just Google Jared Huffman or JaredHuffman.com, you can sign up and be part of the official launch. And I look forward very much to seeing you in the months ahead. This is a very important year that we have ahead of us. And we have a tremendous challenges and the fact that we're gathered here on Labor Day kind of underscores one of those challenges. Because we have these Republican extremists to have somehow taken over the House of Representatives and decided that it wasn't enough to scapegoat immigrants and to scapegoat gaze and to scapegoat environmentalists. Now they have to start scapegoat workers. And I think it's time in 2012 for us to turn the page on this Republican extremism. We can do it. It's only going to take 25 seats in the House of Representatives to bring it back into Democratic control. And I know that we have the message. We have the conviction to get out there in 2012 and do it. I hope to be your representative on this new second congressional district. It's going to be a year of change for all of us. Whether you've been in the southern end of that district represented by Len Wolsey or the northern end by Mike Thompson. They have represented us very well in all parts of this area. But for the first time in many, many years we're all sending someone new to Congress to represent you. I will be articulating my vision for this district and for this country. In the months ahead, I'll be up here a lot. And one thing that I think you'll see is going to be different about my campaign. Is that I'm going to tell you about what I've done. Not just what I've promised to do. Because I think a record of getting things done, especially if it involves cutting through partisan gridlock. Which I have had to do quite a bit of in Sacramento these past few years. If you can get things done in that environment, that tells you a lot about how someone will perform in Congress. So I'm thrilled to be here. I look forward to speaking with as many of you as possible, getting to know you on the campaign trail ahead. And I hope you will support me for Congress. I'm Jared Huffman. Thanks.",

        "transcript": " So is Congress been hot for here yet by chance? Yes! So it's so much today to have the words for more Congress and often. So let's give them a minute and give them a big hand here. Thank you! How are we doing? This is a beautiful set today. I want you to know how important what you're doing is for our country, for the soul of our country today. Our ability to come together quickly, to mobilize, to organize, to collectively raise our voices and move the needle of public opinion in this country is the only reason that President Trump is at least somewhat on the defensive right now regarding his terrible family separation policy. So we got to keep this up. I'm going to tell you we're headed to Valley to fire people up and I will confess to you that in some ways I feel like a terrible speaker to rally like this because this past week I will confess that I spent a couple of days in the pit of despair. All right, I was feeling a little overwhelmed and a little hopeless about the fact that despite the fact that my party has won a majority of votes in six of the past seven presidential elections, despite the fact that the American people are with us on every major issue facing this country, somehow through a combination of gerrymandering and hardball tactics regarding Supreme Court nominees, and blatant corruption involving the 2016 presidential campaign, somehow through a combination of these things, the Republican Party is in control of all three branches of the United States government and they're doing some terrible things to this country. And so the resignation of Justice Kennedy hit me like a ton of bricks and I will confess to all of you I spent a couple of days wallowing a bit in the pit of despair. But if I can snap out of it and get back into the fight on the front lines of the swamp watching the DC, maybe I can contribute to this too and I know that if all of you care enough about it to come here to this rally and to join your voices with millions of people around this country today at similar rallies, then this fight is not hopeless. We should not be overwhelmed. This isn't fight we're going to win. So we have each got a job to do. I've certainly got a job to do back in Washington and you've got a job to do as engaged citizens in this country and perhaps we can draw some strength from each other. We do this because we know that there are some things that are just true. They cut across partisan lines and regional lines and racial and ethnic lines. They even cut through the fog of disinformation that's constantly put forward by the Trump administration. And I'll tell you one of those things that's just true forcibly taking babies from their parents and putting kids in cages is wrong. We know that. We know it in our hearts and our brains that it's just wrong even when Jeff Sessions and Sarah Sanders tells us it's biblical. We know it's wrong. It's also wrong to keep families detained indefinitely in prison style internment camps. And let me tell you that's the next stage of this fight. That's the fight we're going to have to focus on right now because that's the next thing President Trump wants to do. He wants to bring back these prison style internment camps reminiscent of the Japanese internment that was one of the darkest stains in our country's history. We're going to have to fight against that while we're working to reunify kids with their parents thousands of them who have already been separated and are currently being detained. Now we all know we have a mixed history in this country when it comes to immigrants. We haven't always gotten it right. We got some dark chapters in our country's history but most people agree with us that immigration is a good thing and that embracing immigrants many of whom come from horrific violence. Some of the most war torn places in the world that embracing them and taking them in giving refugees and asiles a chance to make their case. That's something that makes our country great. And most people agree with that. One other thing that makes our country great is our historical commitment to human rights in due process. And that's why it's partly why our country has had so much credibility and moral authority in the world community for decades. Now President Trump is trying to take us back or not all of these things in some terrible ways that we have to fight against. He's doing it by denigrating and dehumanizing immigrants. He's doing it with his hateful rhetoric and policies. He's trivializing human rights as a core value in American foreign policy and the world is watching as he does these things. As he forcibly separates babies from their parents to send a message to people in other countries. How cynical is that? As he closes ports of entries for asylum seekers forcing them to cross the borders in other ways and risk prosecution under his draconian new zero tolerance policy as he trivializes domestic violence as a private matter in denying the silence of thousands of domestic violence victims. As he prepares to move families into these prison style in tournament camps and as he constantly moves a goal post for hundreds of thousands of young people who are DACA registrants and who deserve our protection against the 14. So all of this is terribly wrong and we are not going to stand for it. I want to promise you that I'm going to keep up this fight in Congress and I know that you are going to keep pushing too. My offices I want you to know have been receiving thousands of phone calls and emails opposing this family separation policy. I've talked to my colleagues from around the country and they too tell me that there is an unprecedented level of citizen engagement on these issues right now and you can bet that President Trump is hearing it from the people of the United States too. That is what it's going to take. We are going to have to make sure that we keep it up. So I want you to stay engaged. I want you to stay fired up. Be vigilant. Be organized. Be ready to mobilize quickly and let's remember that we are fighting this fight for people that are too vulnerable to fight for themselves right now. We are also fighting, let's remember this for the soul of our country because we are a better country. So I want to close by reminding you and myself of something very important and that is that despair doesn't change a damn thing in this country. Never has. We have got to stay positive. We are going to stay in this fight. This rally, hundreds of other rallies like it all over this country, the marches, the protests, the millions of calls, the petitions and ultimately the most important march of all, the march to the polls. These are the things that are going to change our country that are going to preserve the soul of our country. So thank you for having me. Thank you for being here. Let's keep this up. We have driven through the families. We have driven through the families.",

        "transcript": " I noticed in your testimony that you zeroed in on 2008 as a benchmark year to talk about revenues from oil and gas leasing when you were asked about that by the chair. But there was something a little bit different going on in 2008 that might explain that very high revenue spike wasn't there. We didn't the price of oil rise to $147 per barrel in 2008. Yes, I thought you were probably going to center in on that figure and that is true. But you have to realize that the Arctic area was open to leasing and there were a high bids by a number of oil companies in that area. So it was really the fact that the oil companies wanted to start drilling in the Arctic that opened it, not necessarily that there was a high oil price. That did change the moratorium on offshore drilling, of course. But there's another fact that I think was omitted in your testimony too and that is that we are producing more oil and gas from federal lands today in 2013 than we did in 2008. Isn't that true? Gas has been going down and had continually on federal lands. So I do not believe that's true. Oil? It turns out oil had its peak in 2010 and it has declined in 2011 and 2011. But the oil produced today from federal lands is higher than the benchmark year you used of 2008, correct? It might be. I'd have to check those statistics. All right. We heard you testify about what you've used expansive reserves, almost unlimited reserves of coal. What can you tell us about coal production costs in recent years? Where have they been trending? Well, coal prices have been going up. Specifically production costs. Well, I know the delivered price of coal has been going up. If you take a look at... Deliver cost going up about 7-8% a year. But you have to realize that that includes the transportation costs and oil prices have gone up and the transportation prices have gone up. Does it sound about right? If you take a look at the powder river basin, I think coal there is still around $15 a ton, which isn't that much higher than it was a few years ago. So we're still getting very inexpensive coal at the mine mouth. Coal goes by train, right? Yes, it does. Okay. And production costs, does it sound about right that they've been going up 8-10% per year on average? I'd have to check that. What about the profitability of extracting all of these reserves that you mentioned? Have you done any studies on the actual profitability or are these just sort of hypothetical reserves that could be accessed? No, reserves are by definition coal that you can get economically at today's prices. So you have studied the economic recovery ability of all the reserves that you mentioned? I'm using EIA numbers and 261 billion short tons of coal are economic today. Those are our reserves. All right. Thank you all. You'll be balanced in my time.",

        "transcript": " Good morning and welcome to the Nature Conservancy's California Determining Decade Town Hall. We're very fortunate today to have Congressman Jared Huffman joining us for a Town Hall discussion to take your questions and thinking about our environment and climate change amid this COVID crisis. And I want to take a moment to thank all of you for taking time out of your schedule to participate in this discussion with us. We know this is a very challenging time. All of us are learning new ways of communicating, new ways of working, trying to figure out how we deal with our day-to-day lives in a very unprecedented moment. And Congressman Huffman, thank you for taking time to join us. I want to just say a couple words about the Nature Conservancy here. Nature Conservancy was founded in 1952. The Nature Conservancy is now in 79 countries around the world. We are making a big difference in conserving more than 120 million acres of lands around the world and 173 million acres of critical ocean habitat. In California, we have been on the scene for more than 60 years. Our work here encompasses the conservation of more than a million and a half acres directly in our work and 1.8 million acres of ocean habitat out there. And we are very fortunate today to welcome our California Board of Trustees, our California Leadership Council, our Conservation Professionals, and strategy leads. Many of whom have worked directly with Congressman Huffman over the years in his tenure in the legislature as well as now in the Congress. And this is an exciting moment for us. We have a lot moving forward. The reason we are calling this the determining decade is that we really have just 10 years to turn the trajectory of the planet and really begin to get on a much more sustainable track in managing natural resources and addressing the challenges of climate change both for people and for nature. We're going to begin with some introductions. My colleague Liz Borsberg will be handling a number of your questions. You will see a little bar down in the bottom right of your screen to formulate questions and send those on to Liz and we will be putting those in the queue. So do push that Q&A feature button and Liz will be able to do that in plugging all your questions in today as best we can. And I appreciate the energy of our guest and I will try to be as succinct as possible to get through as much as we can today because we really do have a full slate with Congressman Huffman who represents the second district in California. That district extends from Marin County through Mendocino, Del Norte, Humble, Trinity and Lake counties. I believe are also in there and we have been active on the ground in Congressman Huffman's district from his time in the legislature and began in 2006 through 2012 to his tenure in Congress which began in 2013 and he is just a fantastic member of Congress from the Nature Conservancy's perspective and we really kind of refer to him as the Congressman for Nature. He sits on the Senate or the House Natural Resources Committee, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the Select Committee on Climate Crisis and he also shares the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water Oceans and Wildlife and this committee has the best the best tag is the WOW committee from our perspective and getting things done and it has jurisdiction over federal water projects, fisheries management, coastal oceans policy and wildlife management and endangered species. So it is really really a pleasure to welcome Congressman Huffman to our determining decade town hall today. Congressman Huffman how are you doing all of this COVID adjustments out there? Well I'm hanging in there Jay and it's great to be with you and with members of the Nature Conservancy team. Thanks for being a keeper of the flame really for TNC and the good work that you do. This COVID crisis has really forced a lot of workarounds on all of us and so we're all adapting our work and our daily routines to this unusual situation but I'm hanging in there and just really trying to get my subcommittee and the Congress back on the field so we can continue our work. That's been a real challenge for these last couple of months and I'm really glad to see you doing the same thing for TNC and let me just take a moment to thank all of you for the many years of collaboration and good work. I've just really enjoyed working with you as partners for nature and when you describe my district you describe in an awful lot of good work the TNC has done and continues to do right now in Northern California so thanks for that. Yeah well I know this COVID crisis has also had a personal impact as well that I know that your mother-in-law was diagnosed with COVID-19 and how is she doing now? She's doing just fine she's in a nursing home in Texas and you know you've heard about how congregate living facilities are often hot beds so yeah she did get COVID-19 has recovered and a lot of people have it worse. Yeah yeah we've lost a friend at one of the pleasant hill facilities in the East Bay so it's yeah it's just one of those moments where every moment is precious and we have to recognize that in our moving forward. You talked a bit about some of our early work together one of the most exciting things we did sitting down was why can't we do these fisheries restoration projects a lot faster and let's just let's develop a new track for the Department of Fish and Wildlife and working together on that assembly bell 1961 some years ago to accelerate a stream bed permitting for restoration and can you talk a little bit about your passion for fisheries and this? Well I like to fish and I really love rivers and streams and those environments and so there's a personal connection to that work and I happen to represent some places that are just really spectacular resources so all kinds of reasons why I have enjoyed diving in and doing that work with you and yes we not only did some important streamlining for restoration work in northern California but we renamed the Department the the venerable department of fish and game and I still have some old timers that curse me for that but I think we did the right thing. Absolutely I think that it reflects the wider public trust resources the department has to manage in a state with 40 million people and I think that reality just in you know changing the brand has a big impact and you're right about that I think we've got a deeper consciousness for the full spectrum of work that the department does beyond just the the fishing and the game part of it so appreciate your leadership to get that moving. Turning to an issue that we've worked on pretty actively with you and your staff and again there's the water oceans of wildlife subcommittees probably the focal point for TNC's work in the Congress I mean we we almost I feel guilty sometimes we probably wear our welcome out in your office but you're in such a hub of critical activity across it really are full portfolio and as you know one of the areas that's been a challenge to build a broad consensus in is management of forests and I think you've been helpful at getting us to help other environmental groups and other folks to understand and need to actively manage nature and the forest to bring back and protect the natural wildlife habitat and reduce the risk of these mega fires can you talk about where you think we are in political consensus on the approach that we've been working on together on forests well I think we're definitely making some progress and if I could I'll come right back to that but you mentioned my subcommittee water oceans and wildlife I need to thank the Nature Conservancy for helping me create the water oceans and wildlife subcommittee because when the Democrats took the majority after the 2018 election there was an effort but mainly led by committee staff at natural resources to kind of parse allow some of these jurisdictions and to force me as one of the likely subcommittee chairs to choose between oceans and wildlife and not to combine them into this one you know really super subcommittee that has so much of what we care about in the environmental community we had a lobby for that and it was it was a bit of a fight but we prevailed and I put my foot down and I said I want water oceans and wildlife together and I think it's a great success that we've combined those jurisdictions and now we can do all of that good work in that way so thank you I know that you were part of that effort behind the scene to try to overcome the resistance to that but on forest management one of the reasons I do think we're making progress is that groups like TNC are out there doing this work on the ground with some unlikely coalition partners and demonstrating that you can have these working landscapes they can they can operate for multiple benefits including fire resiliency and improved watershed yield and all of these other things that we talk about and and I think that demystifies it a little bit we're always going to have some friends you know in the environmental community that don't ever want to cut trees and I appreciate the fact that you all have have worked in that space where you understand that working landscapes if they're done really right to high standards are really good for the environment and that that's the way we need to move our forest management and range land management and other working landscapes now as we scale this up we'll have some challenges too we'll be using more fire on the landscape which creates some smoke and nuisance claims there we'll probably end up also using herbicides to do some of this work and you know we're trying to carefully manage all of that but can you help us I mean how do we get that next step how do we make people feel confident a safe barge and how do we you know how do we bring this everybody together that this is the right this is the right path forward well it's not going to be easy and I think our best chance of doing that frankly is the credibility the science-based approach and the brand that TNC brings to these endeavors I think most environmentalists understand that you aren't in love with pesticides and herbicides but you know if you're suggesting we need to use them in very specific applications in very careful ways that goes a long way toward assuring people that this isn't a bad thing so you know I'm really grateful that you're in that coalition and that it's it's not you know some industry-led effort where we wouldn't have that comfort level with how the herbicides would be used I'm using that as an example but I think the TNC brand is a powerful part of making all of this succeed because you bring along a lot of folks who would otherwise be skeptics of some of these efforts within the environmental community yep well that's helpful thank you I do feel like your leadership also inspires water agencies to get more active in this space you know we've got this great partnership with the Placer County Water Agency we're making some headway with you the county water agency and hopefully to continue to move up those watersheds will you know yield more partners and bringing this to scale and and thinking about what are the other tools that help us prevent these horrific mega fires and just the reality that our forests aren't going to come back like they are now unless we really kind of undo a lot of the clear-cut practices that created sort of these even-age management challenges out there across the landscape so hey as we're on the context of thinking about scaling up and resources you've been working hard on thinking about environmental stimulus ideas as an element getting around the corner on COVID-19 how are you feeling about I know it's not the next bill but how are you feeling about our prospects for getting an environmental stimulus to invest in forest health and green infrastructure and some of the other critical areas that need support and funding well I think if we can get a genuine stimulus on the table and you know we've called some of the things we've done so far stimulus and I think we've misused that term what we've really been doing is triage all of the congressional responses so far have been about trying to staunch the bleeding of both the public health crisis on the front line for health care workers and hospitals and clinics and state and local governments that are bearing a lot of those costs watching their revenues go off a cliff so I think so far there's been very little stimulus and an awful lot of just lifelines for all of those needs but very soon I think we're going to have to change the conversation to how we revive basically an economy that's gone into a coma and that's where infrastructure comes in immediately and if we're going to be doing infrastructure and if we're going to make sure that we're doing it in a smart forward-looking way that's climate resilient and green we got to look at our natural infrastructure too so that's our opening I feel confident that we're going to be able to do some things certainly at a minimum some of the backlog on parks and public lands maintenance that's something Republicans have even expressed a willingness to support you've seen what the Senate has done on a big public land funding initiative that we could fold into that effort I hope we can go even further though and you know I'm selfishly looking at my Northwest California wilderness recreation and working forest act which I know that you have helped push along so far and we passed that out of the House of Representatives now you talked about the kind of creative forest management you know we're setting aside a special restoration area in the South Fork Trinity and the Mad River watershed that will provide about 600,000 acres that are exactly what you described places that were clear cut replanted in these plantation even age very unhealthy very fire susceptible manners and we need to restore those areas and they'll create jobs and they'll make us more fire resilient and we will improve coho salmon habitat and other environmental values along the way so we've got some opportunities I'm excited and it'll be between now and you know the end of the summer I think that'll determine whether we can make this happen yeah that's great well we're in a hundred percent so whatever we can do to help move this you know we we want to be an appended ship to provide a catalyst for this so we look forward to continuing to work with you and your staff and that I I'd like to turn also to kind of think about how we you know a lot of the success that you've had has been in a sense that pivot on one of the last great Republican environmentalists who represented your part of the world state senator Peter bear when environmental issues really were bipartisan and one of the things that you have said to me that's really resonated is you want to bring back Republicans to support these issues and can you just talk a little bit about your efforts in the fisheries caucus and then other forums to really grab a mantle of bipartisanship around environmental issues again well I am certainly trying to do that Jay and I appreciate the question and I know that TNC has a long history of just ignoring partisan politics and doing good work for nature and that that's really what it should be all about but that the difficult reality is that there aren't too many Peter bear Republicans left in fact there's almost none left and the Republican party itself has has essentially ostracized any Republicans that continue to think that way so they're not welcome within their own party the way they used to be and you know we've just become so tribal and so polarized but I think you never stop trying and so a couple of ways in which I've done that you mentioned marine fisheries I am determined to reauthorize the Magnuson Act which is the Keystone Federal Law for managing marine fisheries and you know this is an area that was never partisan historically it's always been strongly bipartisan and really non-partisan and yet in recent years like just about everything else it's gotten hijacked with all these other agendas to go after the antiquities actor to go after marine sanctuaries or the ESA and so efforts to reauthorize it have stalled because of those that infusion of politics into it so when I became chair of this subcommittee with jurisdiction over marine fisheries I wanted to try to reset the conversation and I thought a good way to do that is it's not just the the substance we put forward is the process and so I have undertaken this national listening tour where I go around to every region in the country that has a marine fisheries management council and I have these listening sessions I invite Republicans I invite people of all persuasions and so you've you've certainly got some provocative voices that come to the table but I want everyone to be heard and I want to bring science to the conversation and I I've invited Republican colleagues and some of them have shown up for these listening sessions and my my working assumption here is that that we can reset the conversation and take some of the politics out of it and I think it's working so when I get that draft bill and reintroduce it I think it's going to be really hard for my Republican colleagues who constantly want to fulmet this polarization to say that I'm playing politics or to say that I'm being partisan and so I think by sticking out that high ground we do our part to make it better I'm doing the same thing right now in response to the COVID-19 crisis I had a virtual hearing yesterday and I went out of my way to invite Republicans and and bear in mind my ranking member is one of the most bombastic partisans you will find in the universe Tom McLean talk and I went out of my way to reach out to Tom and to say I want you to join me in this we're going to pick a non-partisan subject how the pandemic is affecting fishing communities I'm going to give you full participation and help pick the panelists and participate like we would in an official hearing there's nothing partisan about this and a bunch of his members RSVP that they wanted to join me because you know they represent working waterfronts that are getting hammered so this was shaping up pretty good and then the Republican leadership put out a fatwa and said no you cannot cooperate with Democrats and you must stand down and not participate and no officiaries who had initially said they wanted to join us pulled out all the Republicans who at RSVP pulled out and Tom McLean talk wrote a fire breathing letter to me that said that if our if our founders back in 1789 had intended Congress to meet virtually using video technology they would have said so so that's where we are Jay it's not a it's not a happy report but I'm going to keep trying yeah well we thank you for this I think candidly as we've discussed in the past the fishermen really are ahead of the curve on this as you know our efforts have really been focused on data modernization focusing on certain parts of the industry and trying to expand adoption of data sharing real-time fisheries management on the water to stay away from sensitive over fish species and focus on those that aren't and so we really we appreciate your driving this to a modernization of the Magnuson Act if you will and really thinking about how we use better how we use technology more effectively on the water with fishermen buying into it and really driving their market and and and I think that that's the corner that we we really do need to get around yeah I was gonna open it up this point Liz is flagging me that we're getting quite a few questions in I do want to thank our Board of Trustees the Leadership Council our Nature Conservancy staff team that's providing again a lot of the intellectual work that we're trying to bring to the Water Rishings Wildlife Committee staff and Congressman Huffman and for those of you that haven't found it yet it's a question tab down in the lower right hand corner and with that Congressman let me turn it over to another familiar face for you my colleague Liz Forsberg to help manage some of the question flow we're getting in here thank you hi Liz. Hi good morning Congressman we have a couple of questions on climate change so I'll start with a broader one and then we'll get into a more specific question so the first one is California has been a leader in addressing the global challenges of climate change do you see the COVID-19 crisis having an effect on how people think about air pollution and climate change potentially you know I think all of these cross cutting impacts of the COVID-19 crisis I'm not sure whether this will settle out as something that really helps our climate efforts or something that sets us back because of what it's doing to the economy basically but there will be some opportunities and you know the fact that folks in Southern California can actually see mountains and snow and that we have clean air and you know we have some at least anecdotal and very interesting evidence of wildlife resilience those are positive things our fishing communities right now are you know largely staying in the ports because there's no demand for their product they can't sell through restaurants right now and so you know any any over fished or threatened fisheries are going to get a little bit of relief just by virtue of this economic downturn now that's not a great thing for for people and for the economy but maybe there's a way in which it it inspires people to do more to protect nature I think the one way in which it could be beneficial is that this pandemic really exposed how important science is and how we really just have to step up collectively and respond using science and actual facts if we're going to save ourselves from situations like this and I think the climate crisis lends itself to a really similar argument that I hope will will be apparent to people going forward Congressman can you talk a little bit about the work of the select committee on the climate crisis we didn't really touch on that and I know that's an important area of work for you sure yeah so the select committee chaired by Kathy Castor of Florida spent a year and a half holding all kinds of hearings and meetings and the culmination of our efforts according to our our charge from speaker Pelosi was to be a report that was supposed to be issued at the end of March now obviously the the pandemic hit just about everything in congress was shelved and so our report well it was substantially finished I mean I have a huge three-ring binder that is the draft report from the select committee it was held back and there's a couple reasons for that one is that doing anything not directly related to the pandemic right now politically strike some people as a little tone deaf so the timing needed to be reconsidered but the second is that I think we want to step back and rethink at least some of the framing if not you know many of the provisions in our report in the face of this pandemic and and so we're taking that opportunity to do that and I can't tell you exactly when the report will come out we're going to work closely with speaker Pelosi and figure out a time that makes sense but you know we're not we're not abandoning it by any measure we're just thinking trying to think strategically about when it comes out and I think you'll be pleased by a lot of what you see because you know as good as something like the Waxman Markey bill was a decade ago which was the high water mark for you know climate policy making in Congress it it was not an economy-wide look at the climate crisis in fact it wasn't really even looked at as a crisis at that time we are we're responding you talk about it this next decade is being so pivotal that's exactly how we're approaching it in the climate report and we're looking economy-wide at everything including natural systems so I think you'll be pleased certainly by the scope of what we put out there we won't presume to very prescriptively say how we're going to tackle every single issue for example there will be a recommendation that we embrace carbon pricing but we're not going to articulate exactly what kind of carbon pricing where that price should be set etc so just want to manage your expectations but I think you'll like a lot of what's in that report when we finally push it out well you've long been a champion for the role of conserving natural and working lands and EO Wilson gave us kind of a new target in his recently published book to conserve 50% of the lands that are out there and leave them untouched is that a topic that will be addressed in the report well probably not as ambitiously as EO Wilson puts it forward I love I love his work and I love the way he stretches our imagination and I think he's probably right you know spot on with the science and everything else we're going to talk about the need for biodiversity and for resiliency for wildlife and natural systems and also how they can be part of the climate solution but I doubt that you're going to see anything as as prescriptive as what EO Wilson challenges us to do plus he's he's looking globally and and we're looking primarily at the United States yeah well that's great we look forward to that report well let me turn this back to you I just got the way they're in climate building on the climate theme can you share your thoughts on HR 763 from the citizens climate lobby which include the fee on and dividend on oil extraction oil extraction yeah so this is one of several carbon pricing models that is being advanced out there and there is a bill that is bipartisan in the Congress that's a good thing to have any Republicans and a whole bunch of moderate Democrats and some progressive Democrats supporting this fee and dividend carbon pricing models the real elegant model it would be revenue neutral and kind of like the Alaska permanent fund for oil this would create a bit of a constituency for climate change by turning those carbon revenues right back to the American people so it's a really interesting and innovative idea here's why I'm not co-sponsoring the bill to be very candid it also calls for a freeze on EPA regulation under the Clean Air Act and I can't go there I cannot suspend any of our rulemaking tools as a price for doing carbon pricing and I think that reflects a continuing notion that some people bring to this issue that if you just do carbon pricing everything takes care of itself that it's sort of like the silver bullet and the more I look at this and look at what's been done historically in another countries that the less I am convinced that carbon pricing really is a silver bullet I think it's it's a bunch of buckshot really and carbon pricing has to work in tandem with standard setting and with in some cases just bands on things and with some policies that are command and control keep it in the ground restrictions on fossil fuel development I really don't want to give up any of those tools because my analysis convinces me that betting everything on carbon pricing is not what's going to get this done in the next 10 years in fact it takes a long time for markets to mature and to function properly and even when they do they often don't don't work so I'm not there for a market mechanism only response to climate change I am there for carbon pricing and conjunction with all these other tools and that's why I respectfully think that bill needs some more work. Got it thanks thanks for that. Liz what else do you have to get there? Some more questions on legislation the Great American Outdoors Act funds the land and water conservation fund as well as provides funding to address the maintenance backlog international parks. What do you think the prospects are for moving a companion bill through the house and what is the likely path forward could this be done in the context of economic stimulus? I short answer yes I think there's a great opportunity to do this and it's really strange to have some Republican senators and even President Trump you know extolling the land and water conservation fund and calling for its permanent funding we all know that Donald Trump doesn't even know what the LWCF is. One of his pollsters has definitely told him that Cory Gardner knows what it is and that his his political life may depend on delivering some of this stuff so yeah we've got a real opportunity and I think there is certainly a lot of desire in the house to to get that done. Yeah well I think it's important also a lot of these programs and we've just been doing some work with Bay Area Council to identify the link between these investments and jobs and future economic resiliency. I mean FEMA has already told us that addressing climate risk pays out a six to one dividend on communities to address flood risks, sea level rise, fire risk and so I hope that people are understanding that and I think you're I think you're getting folks to think more broadly in that realm so you know I guess we just have to keep filtering in here. Yeah you know our part of our challenge in the house will be Rob Bishop. He is no fan of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. You know that he has tried to hijack it and reinvent it and you know even take some of those royalties and put them back into a fossil fuel internship program and training program for the fossil fuel industry which is just a grotesque idea for the LWCF but what he gets out of this is you know sort of what he would like to see is his crowning achievement as he leaves Congress his own Parks Maintenance Backlog funding bill would be part of the mix presumably so we should be able to to thread that needle and get it done. Right. Curious are you hearing anything from the Interior Department about their plans or strategy for reopening national parks as we're thinking about are we reopening California? No although you know I sort of shudder to think about where they might take us and messages that are probably inherent in whatever they would try to do with Donald Trump looking on. I'm grateful that at least here in California and in my district our local park superintendents have been deferential to the state public health standards and to our local public health directors so you know I've got I'm national park rich in my district and they are shoulder to shoulder with our local public health directors in terms of you know how they're going to restrict access and then eventually how they're going to gradually reopen and do it in a way that's safe so we're in good hands at least here in California. Great. All right let's let me turn back to you here. Great so moving on to our oceans does your subcommittee also deal with plastics and micro-micro-pastics in the environment? Why can't we plan plastics and replace them by a better alternative? Gosh I would love to do that. That that sounds great. My subcommittee does have that jurisdiction and we are going to when we can get back on the field we are going to do some ocean plastics hearings. Senator Allen, sorry Congressman Allen Lowenthal has really been leading on this on the House Natural Resources Committee and he has a bill to address this but I think we've got to do a lot more you know maybe one of the ways in which this break from the fossil fuel industry that we know we have to have to do for climate purposes maybe one of the the co-benefits can be that plastics are you know sort of another arm of the fossil fuel economy and the less fossil fuels we use the less push for plastics everywhere you know I hope but we we should tackle plastics head on as well. Yeah so we were involved in an effort to qualify an initiative out here to reduce plastics waste across all categories by at least 25% by 2030 and additionally to put processes in place to drive toward renewable plastic products and overall waste production and I'm disappointed to report to you that when the COVID crisis hit our ability to get any signatures on the street for initiatives also went out the door and so we're hoping that if things open up a bit in the month of June that the plastics waste reduction initiative we're just a hundred thousand or so signatures short that we can get that qualified for the November 2022 ballot and I think Californians are really ready to embrace this challenge of moving toward a more renewable more waste conscious and approach to packaging materials so I think there is good news out there but it's maybe on hold for a bit. Liz? Great so keeping on the theme of oceans what are the biggest issues facing management of our ocean and fisheries resources? Well I think making sure that the pillars of the Magnusen Act which has been so successful in rebuilding you know badly depleted fisheries here in the United States and putting us on a path of science-based management and increasingly ecosystem-based management we're going to make sure that the the rigor of the Magnusen Act isn't undermined by folks who they want to err on the side of fishing when there's uncertainty and I think the science would have us err on the side of caution when there's uncertainty you're never going to have perfect science on exactly how many fish you have and exactly what's going on out there but you know those strict rebuilding timeframes those strict catch limits and encodas and the the rigor that has been part of the success the really key to the success in Magnusen they're under fire from a lot of folks who want to go back to the battle days of just fishing stuff to total depletion and then moving on to the next fishery so that's really our challenge I think climate change brings some opportunities because we've got fish stocks shifting all over the place and it has forced a lot of people to understand that we really need to address shifting stocks and other aspects of climate change and that's going to require a lot of science and research and you know that that science is also critical to these other management pieces so I think I think we can do it I really do and these these listening sessions have given me a lot of confidence that there's tremendous support for holding the rigor in the Magnusen act but we will be invited to create you know broad off ramps to science base management at every turn and and Don Young unfortunately has has kind of gone over to the dark side on some of these things so we're going to need to pull him back he used to be you know really good at supporting those key pillars of the Magnusen act and we've got some work to do there yeah we're really hopeful that we can get to your earlier point about getting to science base management and getting some matching federal investment out there to to really help capitalize fishermen to have online technology to really share data on daily catch basis more open lace and and transparently because as we've discussed before these records just sort of sit around in wildlife agencies in paper and metal file boxes and don't really add value and we can really use technology to do so much better here yeah technology really help us in the way you just mentioned Jay but also on the recreational side I mean in a number of places that there's been just a lot more recreational pressure on fisheries and you know growing popularity of recreational fishing greater ability of recreational fishers to just catch an awful lot of fish using the boats and the technology that they now have access to and and so we've got to figure out given that this is an increasing part of of what we're doing out there how do you manage that how do you even get data from recreational fishers it's a totally different situation than all of these commercial operators that you know have to follow all these strict reporting requirements and you know it's kind of easier to regulate them than it is that this this diffused and and unruly situation with with recreational folks but technology can be part of it smart phone apps and other types of reporting and figure out a way to get them into the mix they can help us keep better fish counts as well yeah that's great that's great let's uh what let me let me get you have a rally here all right next question what do you think of carbon offsets is the money currently being raised from offsets being used well or could it be used better well carbon offsets I think are definitely part of the toolbox and I I would never categorically disparage them at the same time if you rely entirely on offsets you're just going to have businesses usual continuing and a lot of places and people buying their way into never really changing anything this is one of the reasons why I think you know just setting a carbon price and counting on it to deliver us from the climate crisis doesn't work because what you'll simply see is you know a lot of fossil fuel entities just pass along a higher price and keep doing exactly what they're doing if you allow offsets in the form of carbon capture and sequestration which I think is a total myth I don't think it it even exists in a in a climate friendly way out there you're going to see similarly business as usual just continue and it's going to be harder to make that that break from fossil fuel that to me I have concluded the key to getting this done is a really hard break from fossil fuel and I think all of these elaborate mechanisms that sort of pretend that we can still have an economy built on fossil fuel we've just really got to confront that and reject it otherwise we're not going to get this done great so moving on to water water some of the biggest challenges in water management in California how can we help develop more resilient water infrastructure and finally do you think there is a prospect for an agreement on federal water legislation this year yeah good question we're going to we're going to try I've got a California water bill that will be introducing here in the days ahead it's a forward-looking bill that instead of inviting us to always fight the last water war over the delta or over a couple of big controversial dams that are unlikely to ever happen it looks at the kinds of things California water managers are doing on the ground and the kind that a whole bunch of them want to do water recycling and and dealing with some of these contaminated aquifers that can be remediated and brought back online through advanced treatment obviously cutting edge water use efficiency you know across all sectors there's so much more that we can be doing desalination I believe is part of the portfolio that has to be in our future because it's going to take pressure off hammered estuaries like the delta and like some of our northern California rivers so I fundamentally believe that our estuaries and our rivers have to stop being the backstop to water demand in the future in California and these other tools can do the job now the nice thing about them is they'll also be more reliable when you think about climate change going forward you don't want to be you know 2030 million southern Californians relying on this far flung water import scheme that is very vulnerable to disruption and to volatility with climate change far better to have your own resources you can manage locally through storm water capture and building up your aquifers and doing some smart desalination in places where it makes sense the kind of water recycling we're seeing in orange county and other places pushing the envelope of reuse that's the future and it makes sense for reliability it makes sense for climate resiliency and it makes sense for those of us that care about rivers and fisheries and natural systems that just have to stop being the backstop for the next increment of water in a growing state like California. I would be pretty remiss if I didn't talk about a potter valley here too I think I don't know that I should call it a depth for nature element of PG&E's bankruptcy but it's certainly and it's been operated as a hydro asset by PG&E I think that the nature conservancy and then north coast salmon partnership if identified this is a real opportunity to decommission that facility and really move forward and get around the corner you've been a champion of this effort can you talk a little bit about your vision of and maybe a timeline on how we actually make progress on potter valley here and keep other stakeholders on board. Yeah this is an exciting opportunity here Jane I'm really glad that TNC has gotten more and more engaged and is working as part of this coalition with CalTRAOD and Trout Unlimited and the Civic Coast Federation of Fishermen and several Native American tribes that see this opportunity to do something big for the eel river you know this was one of California's great salmon rivers and there've been all kinds of things that have hurt the eel river over the last 50 years or so but taking out this dam on the main stem will open up hundreds of miles of really prime spawning habitat and you know we'll work on those other impacts we've made a lot of progress on mitigating the impacts of forest management on restoring some impacts from legacy forest practices obviously the marijuana industry has hammered the eel river watershed but we're making progress addressing that as well so this one the fish passage piece on the main stem eel is big and the great thing about it is this dam has outlived its usefulness put in place a hundred years ago not for water supply but for hydropower to help regulate the flow to a downstream diversion at Van Arsdale you know it has provided that hydropower but came to be a major water supply project in the Russian river basin because that diversion over into the Russian basin kind of helps places like Potter Valley and the Ukaia Valley and the Alexander Valley thrive and become you know major agricultural hubs so a hundred years later we don't need that upstream dam anymore for hydro because PG&E wants out of this project but you've got a lot of folks in the Russian river basin that have come to depend on the water from that diversion now the good news is we've figured out that we can maintain a run of the river diversion to meet those needs in the Russian river basin and we can take out that major dam one of the tallest dams in California as a matter of fact and we can open up all that habitat but it's going to be expensive it's going to require building trust between these interest groups and between these two basins and probably doing things together you know we'll need to make investments for the water supply reliability on the Russian river side as we take steps to to to take that dam down but that coalition's holding together I've got water users in the Russian tribes and fishermen and environmentalists in the eel river basin and they are working together saying we want to go take out that dam and do this project and take over the the furclicens so so far so good it's exciting yeah yeah I think that's very exciting and appreciate your leadership in this a couple of your colleagues I guess this is this project actually borders four congressional districts is it's we've had a lot of interest in this and it's it's just it is I think one of those things that as you point out it's a it's a relic that has outlived its usefulness and we can do something inspiring and restoring the eel river salmon run to and so thank you for your continued shouldering into this and keeping the work moving forward on it so let me why don't we get a couple more questions in if we can and go forward yeah I think we have time for two more questions so here's a big question on what issues would you like TNC to lean in more on hmm well that's fun to think about um let's start with the one we just left off on with the the Pottery Valley project in the eel river restoration opportunity you're already there you know helping with the technical work and other things um we really need to develop the constituency for dam removal in Lake County that's where this dam uh the Scott dam and Lake Pillsbury are and it's one of the main points of opposition and resistance to this two basin solution because there are some folks who have leases on on property these these rentals basically on Forest Service land and they like their Lake Pillsbury recreation they're not a large group but they're really vocal and they've gotten the Lake County Board of Supervisors and Chamber Commerce and others in Lake County to believe that this is really a terrible thing for Lake County it's not it's actually a really good thing for Lake County um there's going to be a lot of jobs that go along with the dam removal and with the restoration work there's going to be a live free flowing river uh that continues to course through that area so anyone who's lucky enough to have a cabin lease or anything else is still going to be in a beautiful place with lots of recreation it's just going to be a little different but we need to um address the potential political backlash within Lake County and I think the naturopon servency it has the relationships and the credibility to really help with that uh that is uh one example and then help me stop oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge uh that is a here and now threat you it's just amazing with $20 a barrel barrel oil and uh with every major lender in the United States saying we won't finance drilling in the Arctic that the Trump administration is pressing ahead with a lease sale that will get pennies on the dollar it'll be some bottom feeder that comes along and uh you know snatches up property rights that will complicate our efforts to protect that place that that really amazing place uh going forward we'll have to buy them out in some future date and we need to just stop this we need to figure out a way to get the Trump administration to stand down and I would appreciate uh your efforts in that regard right right if you have one more you do so crisis is like COVID-19 can be catalyst for change how can we increase the odds that some positive change occurs as we rebuild our economy um thank you for that question I I need to spend more time thinking about positive change because frankly all of the carnage that I see from the Trump administration can be a little overwhelming and all of us uh you know are invited into the pit of despair uh these days whether it's the the malaise from the COVID-19 crisis or just the endless environmental assault that we see from the Trump administration so um the the best I can do is uh look to the way most of us have responded to this imperative of a public health crisis and saving lives and changing our behavior it's really been remarkable uh you know I I go out to when I need to go out to a store or to take a walk on the trail and I just see people stepping up and protecting themselves and others and honoring uh what the public health experts are telling them they need to do and um that's happening all over the country you know blue state red state for the most part vast majorities in the american people have stepped up and accepted the facts and are being part of this collective response um we've got to figure out a way to tap into that same thing because it's really quite hopeful I think and can be part of how we succeed uh in the face of the climate challenge Congressman Hoffman thank you so much for taking this time with uh the California trustees our leadership council uh our strategy teams are uh our folks doing the work on the ground and making things happen and uh you are in inspiration to us your your work and from the top of the upper watersheds to uh getting to science based flows and our rivers and all the way out to a more effective more

        "transcript": " It is absolutely an honor to be with you here tonight for your annual gathering. I want to start by observing what a difference a year can make. Last year at about this time, my constituent, a Washington Post correspondent that was just reference named Jason Resion, was actually imprisoned and being held hostage at Evan prison in Iran. Now we fast forward to this year. And right now, Jason is free to say and write whatever he pleases. He is enjoying a nimen journalism fellowship at Harvard, living there with his wonderful wife, Yegi. Now, Jason went to high school just a few blocks. Yes. Jason went to high school just a few blocks from my district office in Marin County, California. And he had originally gone to Iran in order to connect with his own family heritage, and also as a journalist to write very humanizing stories about a country that frankly is not very well understood by most Americans. For that, for the crime of being a journalist, he was imprisoned and spent 539 days in one of the world's most notorious prisons. Now when we learned in January that Jason was finally going to be released as part of a painstakingly negotiated prisoner exchange, I had the privilege of joining Jason's family and his Washington Post employers in Germany to welcome him back to the free world. I did not know Jason before this ordeal brought us together, but we have actually become good friends now. And I want to tell you, the American Iranian community should be very proud of this young man. He exhibited poise and character before, during, and after his ordeal at Evan Prison, and his remarkable combination of intelligence, thoughtfulness, gentle wit, and modesty make him a uniquely compelling and likable person. Jason and his wife, Yegi, should never have been detained in Iran. He should never have lost 18 months of his life in a prison where he was regularly subjected to physical and psychological abuse. This young couple should not have had their lives turned upside down, but the fact that they are free today is a blessing. And I want to extend a very heartfelt thank you to NIAC for your work to help secure their freedom. Now, I ask advocacy on Jason's behalf was absolutely exemplary. And it's one of the reasons I was delighted to get the invitation to join you tonight so that I could personally thank you for being part of an incredible collaborative effort to get Jason's freedom. And that effort included Jason's family, the Washington Post, it included journalists and human rights advocates all over the world. It included obviously our own White House and our State Department, and also other governments, especially the Swiss. Now, those of you who follow Jason Resion on Twitter, and I highly recommend it if you don't, but if you do, you'll know that he regularly speaks out on issues relating to Iran, including the regime's continuing practice of detaining dual nationals. Jason was in New York City last week for the United Nations General Assembly, and I was able to arrange for him to actually be in the chamber for President Obama's final speech to world leaders. And I thought that was fitting, because in many ways, Jason is a living exhibit to the points that President Obama was making in his speech. Points that included the importance of democracy and human rights, the rule of law, the imperative of embracing tolerance and pursuing a world without nuclear weapons, and the opportunity for Iran to engage constructively with other nations. There were a lot of pieces that had to fall into place to secure Jason's freedom in January, but there's one factor that I believe really made all the difference. And that is the diplomatic channel opened by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Nuclear Deal, with Iran. That is what enabled Secretary Kerry and his colleagues to keep pressing our demands, and ultimately to negotiate a prisoner exchange. And it enabled that agreement to actually hold up even as a patrol boat full of American sailors straight into Iranian waters, and in the final – this is right in the final days before the prisoner exchange was going to go forward. That mishap, I'm sure all of you recall it, could easily have escalated into a major conflict. It could have scuttled the prisoner exchange for sure. Instead, it was quickly diffused by a phone call between Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Zareef. Our sailors were back on their ship a day later, and the prisoner exchange went forward without a hitch – almost without a hitch. I say almost, because, as you know, the revolutionary guard couldn't resist broadcasting inflammatory pictures of our sailors in Iranian custody. And the Iranian media portrayed this as a sort of a military victory. Inside Evan Prison, at that time, this episode was replayed over and over on State TV. For Jason Rezion and the other American prisoners, one of whom I've gotten to know pretty well, he is a remarkable and unbreakable American Iranian Marine by the name of Amir Hekmadi. And Amir told me that in his final days of captivity, his interrogators, in one last unsuccessful attempt to break his spirit, pointed to that State TV coverage and said, do you see that? How does it feel to have your fellow American soldiers captured by Iran? To which Amir replied, what, you kept them overnight and made them meet your terrible Gammé bottom-john? I hope I pronounced that right, by the way. He told me it was this really awful eggplant dish. So anyway, then Amir up the anni and asked his interrogator, by the way, how did it feel to pour concrete into your nuclear reactor? That, of course, brings us to the JCPOA. And one of its central challenges from the Iranian perspective, a point which Amir Hekmadi knew very well when he made that comment. While moderates in Iran shared the opportunity for improved economic relations and diplomacy with the United States, hardliners like the Revolutionary Guard were threatened, if not embarrassed, by a deal that made major concessions to the United States. Now, here in the United States, there are also supporters and critics as well. I'll confess that when the JCPOA was first presented to me and my colleagues in Congress, I was skeptical and I spent many hours deliberating how I would vote. Keep in mind that this is probably the most consequential vote that I have faced as a member of Congress. There was a lot to consider. And my congressional district strongly supports peace and always prefers diplomacy over war. My predecessor in Congress was Lynn Wolsey, who made her mark by giving more than 400 speeches on the floor of the House of Representatives against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I share the view that we have to always do everything we can to avoid wars. But even from an anti-war perspective, the vote on the JCPOA was not simple as I saw it. If the deal was not strong enough, if it allowed Iran to somehow secure a nuclear weapon, that too could draw us into war. If the Sunni Arab states in the region felt the deal did not adequately contain Iran's nuclear program, then they too would want nuclear weapons. And we would have a nuclear arms race and quite possibly a major war, even a nuclear war. Excuse me. Now I would have preferred a deal that simply prohibited enrichment. Instead we have a deal that allows low-level enrichment to continue. I would have preferred a deal that lasted, that was permanent actually, instead of one that lasted 15 years. And frankly, I was hesitant to make concessions to a country that was not only illegally detaining my constituent at the time, but was also stoking conflict in the region. But in the end, after a lot of consideration, I was convinced that the inspection and monitoring provisions were so strong and intrusive that Iran could not successfully cheat. And 15 years would at least give us a foundation for ultimately securing a permanent deal. And hopefully, I know all of us share this hope in time, having a new Iranian regime that is no longer interested in nuclear weapons. The support, I will add, the support of Saudi Arabia Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, and Oman. The country's most likely to pursue nuclear weapons if the deal did not work was critical. In my view and in the view of many members of Congress, it showed that we really were preventing a nuclear arms race. And it undermined Israel's criticisms because it showed that other countries who would be directly threatened by a nuclear arm to Iran trusted this deal to work. Now critics of the JCPOA have been quick to point out that Iran has not stopped engaging in aggressive provocative behavior in the region. Human rights violations have continued unabated. And I take all these issues seriously, but I really never expected a nuclear agreement to solve every challenge we face with the current Iranian regime. Now, just last month, I know that the State Department had to issue travel warnings to Iranian Americans who were thinking about going to Iran because the regime does continue to unjustly detain an imprisoned U.S. citizens. I hope that Iran will come to see that this conduct undermines their ability to have normal business and economic relations with the rest of the world, including Boeing, an important company that they're hoping to do business with, but it's going to be very hard for Boeing to set up technical field offices and other representatives in Iran if they feel unsafe, if this problem of detention continues. So I hope, in the meantime, that any of you who are dual nationals in this room that are thinking of visiting Iran are very, very careful. I am truly worried about the risks right now that Iranian Americans face when they decide to make that kind of travel. When I have no illusions about the Iranian regime, despite the nuclear agreement, I expect that we'll continue to have tensions and challenges for some time to come. But with this agreement in place, we can address those problems without the threat of a nuclear conflict hanging over us, at least for the next 15 years. And hopefully we can continue to utilize the diplomatic channels that we have established, the channels that have already helped us avoid conflict and have already helped secure an important prisoner exchange. And not everyone in Congress shares my cautious optimism and support for the JCPOA, as you well know. Opponents of this agreement are going to continue doing everything they can to undermine it. Congress just voted last week on a set of partisan bills that attempt to undermine the agreement and sabotage diplomacy with Iran. The legislation purports to be necessary to prohibit the U.S. from ever paying cash, ransom to Iran, something that Republicans have recently claimed was done in the prisoner exchange with Jason Resign. It is not true that was not ransom, but that was the pretext for this legislation. Now, if I just want to be clear, if this bill were to become law, and it's not going to become law, thankfully, but if it were, it could prevent any payment from the U.S. government to Iran, even payments that are required by law, thus putting the United States in violation of international law and international accords. That's the same kind of stubborn, arrogant approach that, frankly, has worsened our problems in the world, and it carries real consequence for people, whether they're journalists like Jason Resign or families fleeing violence in Syria or aid workers serving refugees. So I'm very glad that this partisan piece of legislation is not going to become law. They're going to be critics. Yeah. Thank you. There will be critics and frustrations regarding the JCPOA in Iran as well. Now, I'm sure many of you know people and businesses impacted by the sanctions regime, and there's a growing sense of disappointment in Iran that the lifting of sanctions has not translated to the anticipating economic benefits as of yet. Now, I personally never believed the arguments by Prime Minister Netanyahu and other critics of the nuclear deal that this would be a huge immediate economic windfall to Iran. I believe the administration, when they told us that economic relief would be gradual, that it would be modest, but it's possible that some supporters of the deal, even within Iran, may have oversold the economic benefits on this point, and that's going to create some political challenges going forward. I do believe, though, that over time, Iran will see significant benefits from sanctioned relief as they should, and just this week, the Treasury Department finally removed a hurdle for Western aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing, as I mentioned earlier, in order to sell planes to Iran. Hopefully, this kind of practical commercial development will help improve our nation's relationship with Iran. I think our progress will surely continue to be tested, and we'll have to keep up the engagement and dialogue between our countries just as we have done with other countries that eventually ceased to be adversaries of the United States. And in that regard, I think we should look at where U.S.-Cuban relations are today, after decades of a stubborn policy of embargo and isolation. Our ability to make that kind of progress with Iran will depend on significant part on politics inside of Iran. As long as the revolutionary guard and other hardliners are in power, the regime may continue to stoke conflict, to flout human rights, to jail journalists, and to test our resolve. They'll try to maintain an adversarial relationship with the United States as long as possible, because that is how they have justified their own political existence for so long. An normalized relationship with the U.S. could, in their view, undermine the rationale for their own continuing political power. In the meantime, we're going to have to speak out strongly on human rights and other issues, and keep the pressure on Iran to do the right thing. And NIAC is an absolutely essential voice in that regard. Despite our success in securing Jason Resign's freedom and the freedom of the other American prisoners, other Westerners with dual Iranian citizenship continue to be harassed and detained, including Bacar and Siam McNamazi and others. So I want to thank you for strongly and consistently standing up for human rights in Iran, and I want you to know that you can count on my continued support. I have a lot of wonderful things in my Northern California district. I have a third of the state's coastline, the rugged coastline of Northern California. I have giant, ancient, redwood trees. I have beautiful wine countries. So many great things for you to see, and I hope you'll come and visit. One of the other great things I have in my district is a very robust, talented, and engaged community of Iranian Americans. I go to them for feedback on all of these issues that we're discussing tonight, and I'm grateful when they come to me with concerns and feedback. And that's how I came to understand that last year tucked into a much bigger piece of legislation, and without the kind of deliberation and scrutiny that you would expect of the United States Congress, my colleagues and I passed a visa waiver reform that inappropriately impacts Iranian Americans. One constituent who wrote to me had lived his entire life in the U.S., but because of his Iranian-born father who arrived in this country more than 60 years ago, the new law intended to close loop holes in the visa waiver program could impact him in a very, very negative way. And I heard similar stories from people throughout my district, including some Iranian Americans who had never even been to Iran or had never claimed or exercised their dual citizenship. They too could be very adversely affected. So many of us in Congress are working to undo this unfortunate and unacceptable change in the law. I'm sorry, frankly, that we allowed it to happen. Earlier this year, Secretary John Kerry and Secretary J. Johnson took action to clarify travel restrictions for journalists, humanitarian aid workers, and business travelers, but it still doesn't go far enough. That's why, in February, I joined a letter with 25 other members of Congress to Secretary Kerry and Secretary John's and urging them to protect dual national Americans and Americans traveling to Iran from visa restrictions and to ensure that they're not unjustly targeted. The U.S. passport should provide its holder with full benefits and rights of American citizenship, period. So we'll keep working on that, hopefully working closely with all of you, and you'll do your part because this is an election year. And we need to make sure we're getting out the vote, and you need to make sure that candidates who seek your support understand the importance of fixing this problem. The theme tonight is a more perfect union, so I'll just leave you with one final thought. The next president and the next Congress may continue President Obama's policy of cautious and intentional engagement with Iran so that the nuclear deal is implemented to keep the long-term benefits to both Americans and Iranians moving forward. The next president, whoever she may be, the next president might understand the importance of a fair and non-discriminatory visa waiver program, or we could elect a president whose knee jerk instinct is to tear up existing deals and treaties, whose business record suggests a willingness to walk away from binding commitments and obligations, someone who traffics in scapegoating in xenophobia and who's proposed new religious and ideological tests for people seeking to enter the United States. There's obviously a lot at stake for Iranian Americans and for everyone in this country, and we need to make sure we all do our part in the next 43 days to ensure that we continue on a forward path to becoming a more perfect union. Thank you again for all you do. Now, I think we can tell we're all big fans. I just wanted to share a little anecdote that sort of shows how grateful we are for Congressman Huffman's leadership. There are a lot of members of Congress who are great leaders, but they don't necessarily have great leaders around them. Congressman Huffman's staff has been unrivaled in how much they listen, how attentive they are to our community's needs both in district, back in Marin County, and on the Hill. And as Congressman Huffman said, what we're trying to do is build relationships with each of our lawmakers on the Hill, and Congressman Huffman's office is a model of what good listening and good relationship building can be. And so for that, we wanted to give you a small token of our appreciation. As you go to Marin County, Iranian American homes, you will recognize these little Persian boxes that many of us have. And so we just wanted to make sure you had one as well. So, anyway. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Good evening and welcome to Law Talk. The show that brings you the Constitution and the legal issues of the day, one evening a month. I'm Mark Mollikowski and with me I have Kevin Kylie and James Barrett's on vacation this month so I'm going to be hosting. So Kevin, you've been on our show before and last time you were here you talked a little bit about Prop 47 but for people who missed that show can you give me a little idea about your educational background, your work background and what you're up to these days and kind of what we rehash of what we covered on Prop 47. Sure, sure, no problem and thank you very much for having me on again. I enjoyed the opportunity to be here some months back to discuss Prop 47 and really appreciate the invitation. So I'm Kevin Kylie. I worked as Deputy Attorney General for the state. I'm currently the Republican nominee for the California State Assembly in the sixth district and last time we were on we discussed an initiative that was passed in 2014 known as Prop 47 and right now in California we're in the midst of the biggest increase in crime we've had in some time and that is directly attributable to the fallout from Prop 47 and a number of other misguided measures. So Prop 47 from my recollection had to do with a lot of crimes that used to be felonies were downgraded to misdemeanors and that took some power away from prosecutors and now I've even noticed going into Walgreens or CVS a lot of people just walking they take stuff and that people are going to excuse me sir but people are just walking out with stuff now there's not much to store keepers can do if it's under a thousand dollars. Exactly if it's under nine hundred and fifty dollars then I'm sorry. The punishment could be no more than a misdemeanor no matter how many times you do it it's not worth prosecutors even going after them usually it's just a citation and you're like go and this is given birth to what's known as the frequent flyer phenomenon where you have guys who are caught stealing you know a dozen times and still nothing can happen to them. Okay so and lately what why don't we talk a little bit about your background what's your educational background. So I have a a bachelor's from Harvard I have a law degree from Yale and I have a master's in secondary education from Loyal and Mariam. So you were a school teacher for a while right. I was yep I taught 10th grade English. Okay and where was that. That was down in LA. Down in Los Angeles okay and the district you're running for is district. It's district six and that's near Roseville. Yep Roseville is the largest city in the district it's a bit east of Sacramento and so didn't you have some you didn't you have some competition in the primary. We had a pretty competitive race actually yeah we the most candidates of any state legislative race in all California there are 11 of us and of course we have the open primary now in California so there are eight Republicans two Democrats and an independent and so now it's myself and one of the Democrats that it's advanced and you know I was a really spirited race there were some great candidates in there so I feel quite lucky to still be on my feet. So a big day is coming November 8th right that's how it's the general yep okay and so you're getting prepared for that great okay so you're going to be right an assembly person or assemblyman if you're if you if you prevail and how many assembly people are are in the state legislature. So the assembly is one of two houses of the legislature it's just like Congress for the federal government you have the the Senate and the House of Representatives there in California it's the same thing you got the Senate we just call the lower house the state assembly so there are 80 state assembly members the each one represents just under half million people and their their term is for how many years two years so you have a two year term and the Senate how many senators are there in the state of California and and what's their term one so 40 senators each one represents around a million people and they serve four year terms okay four year terms and is there any term limit of how many terms you can serve what's that so you can serve up to 12 years overall and that can be allocated any which way between the House and the Senate. Even if you're a governor is that count two or is it just for the Senate. That's separate the deal okay okay so you've got a big election coming up and tonight we want to talk a little bit about prop 57 because that's going to be on the November 8th ballot as well right exactly and so that's the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016 and I think that governor Brown has invested a lot of money in this and I think he's got a lot of money left in his work chest. He has I don't remember the exact amounts of money he's putting it but I know he's he's put in maybe about a quarter of money he has which is several millions so he's got multiple millions that he wants to put into this so. So governor Brown has is putting a lot of prestige and money behind this so what do you think is his if his his impetus for wanting to get this pass. Well that's a great question and you know I don't know exactly what his motivations might be. He was governor at the time that what's known as determinant sentencing went into effect. So three strikes would not exactly the determinant sentencing just sort of means that there are fixed terms you know a given number of years for particular crimes. But isn't there sometimes like from two to four to the six. Yeah so there's still some room for a minute. Okay all right instead of but a judge you can't say you you know one guy gets six years the other guy gets one day. It's got to be right right. Two to six or whatever exactly. Somewhere in that range. Okay so this prop is just with 50 cents. The proponents say that that it authorizes pro-conservation for people with nonviolent convictions who complete their full sentence for their primary offense. Now some of the wording in the in the bills a little complex and so can you kind of explain to us what's a primary offense what's a secondary offense what's an enhancement. Sure sure sure. And you give me some examples run us through some examples so folks reading this bill have some idea of what it's about. Right well here's the first thing to know that if this proposition is passed it'll make up to 30,000 inmates eligible for early release. 16,000 of those would be eligible for early release the day that the proposition takes effect. Now it says there in the little summary that will appear on the ballot and was prepared by our attorney general that this only applies to nonviolent offenders. But I think you'd be surprised to learn some of the crimes that qualify as nonviolent. Here are a few examples. Rate by intoxication is considered a nonviolent offense. Rate of an unconscious person is considered a nonviolent offense. Sex trafficking drive by shooting assault with a deadly weapon taking a hostage false imprisonment of an elder just to name a few. These are considered so unviolent offense. So you're telling me that a drive by shooting is considered nonviolent. Correct if you actually you know hit your target then it might graduate to a violent crime. Okay so if you're a bad shot then it's nonviolent but if you hit him then you'd be in trouble. Correct correct. So you know that's kind of strange because usually an attempt is just as serious as completing the crime. Yeah well this is sort of a separate offense but if you look at arson arson causing great bodily injury you can actually succeed there. Still considered a nonviolent crime under the law that prop 57 will apply to. So that's the first thing to know about this initiative is that it will lead to the early release of thousands and thousands of dangerous offenders and voters are being misled as to who these offenders are. Okay well proponents say that this is going to save taxpayer dollars by reducing wasteful spending within our correctional system. So what kind of you know as things stand now what is the wasteful spending that the proponents are talking about here? I mean keeping too many people in prison for too long? That's a that's a good question. The same claims were made about prop 47 past two years ago which has led thousands of folks out early and an analysis by the nonpartisan legislative analyst office have showed there have been minimal savings and in fact as the prison population has decreased the costs of the corrections budget has increased. So you know the fiscal impact of the initiative is anything but clear and of course there's a vast social cost associated with increased criminal activity but I want to get back to the question that you asked a minute ago which is what exactly does this mean? What is a primary offense and and all of that? Okay well let's let's kind of move on here and talk a little bit we'll come back to that but let's talk a little bit about some of the due process issues and some of the issues here that that seems to me that there's going to be some some big changes in the way that that that defendants are viewed okay because my understanding in the past a prosecutor had the discretion of whether they were going to charge a juvenile as a you know as an 18-year-old you know as an adult in certain cases you know if the crime was heinous or they showed there were certain maturity or the level of violence was so high that you know it or maybe in certain gang things that looked like they're acting as an adult so so what do you think about a situation like that? Is that going to be a big is that going to stymie prosecutors somehow? Well so Mark's referring to another provision of prop 57 this is a relatively less significant one than the other provisions but it's still as you know to potentially you know a potential change to the system this is different than what we were just talking about this is a provision that specifically relates to juvenile offenders the existing rule gives prosecutors the discretion whether to try them as an adult the proposed change here would put that decision in the hands of judges which is and it would also change some of the rules as far as which kind of offenses automatically qualify for treatment as an adult. Okay so now judges in general are more lenient than prosecutors as far as deciding whether juveniles are tried as adults is that kind of a sense that that the proponents have is that there'd be more juveniles staying in the juvenile system than getting bumped up in the prison system is does that their apparent goal there? You'd have to ask them I mean it is sort of a departure from the adversarial system that really defines our legal system at all levels and you know in all forms which is that it's you know in the context of criminal cases it's the prosecutions duty to try to prove their case and it's the duty of the defense to try to cast out on that case and then the judge is there is sort of a referee charging decisions usually are not put in the hands of judges but here it would give them that decision even when it comes to say a 17-year-old gang member who commits a murder. So it's kind of a little bit like the Napoleonic system the judges involve being prosecuted or in charge right or in the quiz tutorial right. So that's kind of a that's kind of a big change. Okay so one thing I think that the proponents talk about is in the juvenile system people have an opportunity for more rehabilitation than the in the prison system. Do you view that as as is a big difference I mean is it more likely that the citizens are going to be rehabilitated going through the juvenile system or going to the prison system to have any thoughts on that. It seems that their their idea is that you know there's a chance the juvenile could be recovered I guess it going through the juvenile system. Yeah I mean I usually when a juvenile is tried as an adult it's really only the most serious cases you know and where the crime has shown a you know an adult like a faculty for depravity on the part of the juvenile. So you know this again is a provision that I don't think is going to be a good one but you know it's comparatively minor when you know next to the major you know provisions of this initiative which could potentially lease release up to 30,000 dangerous offenders early. Okay so one of the claims of proponents is this the prop 57 keeps the most dangerous offenders locked up and they're saying over the last several decades California's jail and prison system population have exploded and California spends nearly 10% of a general fund on our prison system and we're spending too much money liking up nonviolent offenders. So what they're what the prop is is 50 57 proponents are saying that this is only for nonviolent offenders but let's kind of go back and let's touch back on the on what we're saying the primary offense secondary offense enhancements. Yeah how sentient how sentient are figured out right right right and how is this going to affect that. Yeah so it on its face applies to nonviolent offenders of course we've seen that many of these offenders are committing some of the worst crimes you can you can think of but basically this initiative would be a blow to the heart of what's known as proportionate sense you know the idea that if you commit a more serious crime maybe you should do more time or if you commit multiple crimes maybe you should receive more punishment than someone who commits just one or if you have convictions for serious crimes in your past maybe that merits additional punishment. Prop 57 would sort of in one fell swoop sweep all of that aside and you know these are fairly common sense intuitive ideas that have you know are deeply embedded in our criminal code and have been vital towards public safety in California so when you receive a sentence your primary offense if you're convicted of multiple crimes that's the longest sentence that you're given the most serious crime. Now under existing law you can still be punished for the other convictions and then serve those sentences consecutively. What this initiative would do is it say the regardless of how many other crimes you're convicted of and the other consecutive sentences that are imposed you'll be eligible for parole after you've served the primary term. Okay let's say that you rob a bank okay so you've got an armed robbery let's say that you end up shooting the guard okay and the guard dies so you've got a murder and let's say you're using a gun in the crime. So those would be I guess gun would be an enhancement you've got a murder and you've got an armed robbery. How would this work for those? You're telling me the armed robbery might get thrown out and the murder would be the count. So yeah good question so if you have multiple convictions then you would only have to serve the prison term for the primary offense. With then you'd be eligible for parole you could be released after you've served that regardless of how many other years were tacked on because of the other crimes. So that's one way that this would lead to early releases is by getting rid or at least making people eligible for early release before they've served the consecutive sentences. Now a second way in which it would undermine existing sentencing laws is by making inmates eligible for parole before they've served enhancements and so you know you're familiar with an enhancement. This is if you commit a crime in such a way that it's especially bad above and beyond the the garden variety version. Let's say you're drunk driving but you're going over 80 miles an hour that could be enhancement or let's say you're a drunk driving but you're drunk but you're over a point one five or something like that. So you know so the enhancements usually committing the crime but but doing something a little lecture. Yeah so you brought up a good example in your initial scenario which is that you know if you commit robbery you'll get a certain sentence and then if you happen to use a gun during the commission of the robbery then there'll be extra years tacked on because that's worse that makes the robbery worse or if it's a hate crime or if it's the crime is connected with a gang activity or if there are multiple victims those are all things that lead to extra years being added to your sentence and deservedly so because this causes more suffering. This is a more serious violation of the law yet. Prop 57 would say well it's own after you've served the primary the term for the garden variety offense regardless of how many years you are required to serve for the enhancement you can be released right then and there. Okay well let's so what we're talking about here is this is a pretty serious proposition it changes a lot of things and you know so there's a lot of technicalities and I'm glad you've straightened some of those out right but let's kind of move on and think of what what is what is going to be the outcome of this I mean what will be the eventual result in your prediction and then what are the proponents predict and also looking at prop 47 what what was the outcome of that so let's let's kind of you know kind of look into our crystal ball here and see what we think might happen if this is past what would remain the same if it's not passed so what are your what are your thoughts on that? Well you know this is the last thing that our state needs right now we're in the midst of an uptick in crime that you know the likes of which we haven't seen in a long time in the state we had that several measures the latest being prop 47 that have lowered the penalties for criminal activity that have released thousands of offenders early that have weakened the ability of law enforcement to effectively fight crime and you know in San Francisco for example there's been an increase in property crimes not of 6% not of 66% but of 66% and we've seen big increases in violent crime as well and so the answer in my opinion and a centerpiece of my campaign is let's put public safety first again when it comes to the way we approach fighting crime well the proponents of prop 57 for instance say that this would be a great thing because it gives something something for the prisoners someone who's convicted something to aim for you know they can get some time off if they take classes if they don't get into any altercations with guards are the prisoners so they don't get written up so this gives them some kind of goals and that helps towards their rehabilitation sure what do you what do you say to that to that argument well so this is a third provision now that you're that you're bringing up we've talked about two already one being the basically a limitation to a large degree of proportionate sentencing a second being the shift in basically charging discretion for juvenile from prosecutors to judges now you're alluding to a third provision of this initiative which would give the department of corrections an unlimited ability to award what they call good conduct credits so for the sort of things that you mentioned and under existing law we have these things in fact the usual scenario is someone only serves half their sentence and because of these sort of credits and there are good behavior credits that are in the system now within limits but this would basically give the department of corrections state bureaucrats the ability to let even violent offenders not just nonviolent offenders that the other provisions apply to but to let murderers rapists out of prison early based upon what they deemed to be good behavior okay well one thing that the the bill states that it would require that the secretary of corrections certify that the regulations implementing these policies protect and enhance public safety so that's kind of an interesting clause it's going to require the secretary of corrections to certify that this is going to protect and enhance public safety what are your thoughts on that well we should note that the name of prop 57 is the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act so you know the proponent and prop 47 had a similarly or a well-earned name so I don't think we can take great confidence in this requirement that there's a stipulation that the early releases are the interests of public safety okay so let's look at a couple of other so okay so Governor Brown so far spent about five million dollars and he still has twenty million dollars in that fund so he's arguing that we've got to get these reforms done and I guess he's got a bankroll of or a purchase of twenty million dollars he spent about a quarter of that do you have any idea the the opponents what do they have in their work chance I don't know exactly what their fundraising is looking like now but I do know that there is a coalition of law enforcement officials that have lined up very emphatically behind the no campaign for this initiative district attorneys and sheriffs and judges and victims groups from across the state who don't want to see you know folks who rape an unconscious person for example let out a prison early I'll give you one example of you know someone who will be eligible for early release under this initiative a gentleman named Andrew Stewart Luster was arrested for rape in 2003 he fled to Mexico he was eventually captured from to California he was convicted of twenty counts of drug induced rape and seventeen counts of raping an unconscious victim he was originally sentenced to 124 years in prison in 2013 and judge ordered him to prison for 50 years as an interesting side note when he started a skip bail it was dog the bounty hunter who brought him back but uh... in any case uh Andrew Stewart Luster if prop fifty seven passes will be eligible for immediate release and their countless others like him who are just not the sort of offenders that uh... should be glad out of prison so I am looking at how many years he had fifty and then plus another hundred twenty two so fifty overall right now the zero overall serving yeah for seventeen counts of raping and unconscious okay so he's looking at fifty years and that could be kind of he could have clemency for that under this new prop fifty seven right because uh... you know if you're convicted of multiple counts remember you only have to serve the term for one of them and also for you're doing drive by shootings in your bad shot you get clemency for that as well right i mean uh... i don't know if it's quite fair to call it clemency but uh... you you're eligible to be released for parole okay i'm after serving the primary term okay so um now let's talk a little bit about marcy's law three strikes in your out the uh... uh... so what would this have effects on the three strikes uh... uh... uh... uh... policy yes it would and uh... this is uh... the third way in which um... this uh... initiative would uh... compromise proportionate sentencing again the idea that the more serious the crime the more the more time you should get uh... the first remember was by uh... kind of discounting your other crimes right the second um... was by making the eligible for parole before enhancements the third is that it ignores uh... the uh... convictions that you have in your past so three strikes was passed for example to create this uh... escalating uh... punishments so you'll be punished more severely for your second felony than you were for your first um... again this initiative would make you eligible for parole uh... after you've served the uh... term for your primary offense irrespective of whatever additional punishment would have been imposed by virtue of your earlier offenses okay how about gang related activity does this have much bearing on that yeah this is so gang related activity uh... if a crime is connected to a gang uh... that's an enhancement that can get you uh... additional time and uh... this is a big objection of law enforcement groups actually is that they rely on enhancements uh... like the gang related activity uh... to try to deter and break up gangs so that the proper for fifty send would lessen that enhancement or remove that enhancements you could uh... exactly okay all right so okay so uh... governor brown says that he regrets his support in nineteen seventy seven when he was governor last time um... for establishing a determined of sentencing sentencing laws in California now we um... he says these led to the sabbush of strict sentencing guidelines mandatory minimum sentences and hand sentences for certain crimes and so he's saying he regrets that um... and and so you're saying uh... that maybe this germicence is a good thing can you can you discuss that just real briefly what's your feelings on that yeah sure i mean uh... is our criminal justice system perfect uh... now of course not uh... i think that there is certainly room for thoughtful people to uh... have a serious discussion as to uh... where our sentencing law uh... does and does not make sense i do think that the reforms that we made uh... in the Wilson administration for example to uh... increase the penalties for the most serious crimes has uh... serve the public well it led to a couple decades of decreased crime it uh... it improved public safety and now governor brown is rolling all of that back and uh... he's doing so or the uh... the proponents of prop fifty seven uh... as well as prop forty seven are doing so in a way that is not forthright with the public as to what the risks are when you call something the public safety and rehabilitation actor the safe schools act uh... but what it actually does is let thousands of dangerous offenders at a prison early um... that's not being forthright with the public about the risk if you say it only applies to nonviolent offenders but in fact you're letting out uh... folks committed of raping an unconscious person or assault with a deadly weapon or domestic violence involving trauma uh... that's not being forthright with the public so we can have those discussions and there are discussions that should be had by and uh... you know i will look forward to engaging with folks on the legislature as to how we can best protect public safety but the way to do it isn't by misleading the public in the something that uh... you know that's good really having a detrimental effect on people's lives well i think one of the selling points of this bill and i and i actually would support these particular ones where that you know if they can have more incentives more incentives for it for it inmates to be good behind bars yeah uh... but maybe so that part of this bill i think is what's kind of pushing it through and some of these technicalities aren't aren't as well understood sure sure so i think that uh... you know people should link very carefully at this and do some studying before november eight and then also i wish you the best on november eight and i'm really happy to come here tonight rod the the and the the music",

        "transcript": " Republican Lawmaker Kevin Kylie worked as a teacher, attorney, now assembly member. His next goal is to become the governor of California. He joins us now and Kevin first tell us why you're running, why you'd like to be the next governor of California. Well, I'm running to try to restore integrity to our state governments and return to the idea of government by the people. You know, I got involved. I ran for office five years ago, having, as you said, worked as a high school teacher, being defended the constitution and our courts, having been a prosecutor, keeping our community safe. But I'd seen how our state government was failing us in so many ways, failing to just do the basics. And so I've been fighting to turn things around over the last five years. But I see this recall election as an opportunity for the people of our state to put their mark directly on our government and to set California on a whole new course and having been fighting for that for the last five years in the legislature and seeing how broken our state government is in so many ways. I know how to go about on day one starting to fix it. Well, unlike most of your competitors, you do work in politics. How would you say that could benefit you if elected? Well, I've seen that, you know, what has broken our state government is that we have a state capital that has been corrupted, that is controlled by lobbyists and special interests. Way more so than you usually think about politicians sort of being subservient to interest. Here is just a matter of just total capture. And that's why the quality of life in California has been declining. And so, you know, what I decided to do, I became the first state wide elected official in modern California history to say I'm not going to accept any funding from special interest groups. I'll only take backing from individual citizens. These special interests in their lobbyists give hundreds of thousands of dollars to every legislator. They've given tens of millions, really over 50 million to Gavin Newsom in this recall election alone. And that is what has been, you know, causing our state to decline is that we have a government that doesn't actually serve the people. And we've seen that more than ever over the last year and a half of our lives. Let's talk about some of the issues. A lot of the candidates critical of the governor's handling of the pandemic. How would you grade his response? And of course, how might you handle things differently? Well, I'd give him the worst possible grade on the scale because unfortunately what this governor did is he immediately seized this moment of utmost vulnerability for our state and used it as a political opportunity. That's what he said from the very beginning, actually, that he was using it to advance his ideological agenda or even worse to reward the big special interest groups that put him in power. And you know, the issue that I think is perhaps the worst one of all is that he did a school shutdown that was not guided by science, was not guided by public health, was not guided by the interests of our kids, but was entirely about special interest groups. And California was last in the country, 50th out of 50, and getting our kids back to the classroom. And while also having some of the worst public health outcomes in the country, the governor knew that having kids in school was the right thing to do. He sent his own kids to in person private school, but because of his subservience to special interest groups, he deprived millions of California kids of that same opportunity. Let's talk about the public school system as a former teacher. You've been critical of that system. What do you think are the main issues there and what does need to change? Well, the reality is that for a while we've had a public education system that has been on the decline. We keep spending more and more money and yet achievement gaps keep growing. Our education outcomes are among the worst in the country. As a matter of fact, even prior to COVID-19, we ranked 49th out of 50 in terms of how well our students perform in underserved communities. I taught in one of those communities. I taught 10th grade English in inner city Los Angeles, and the average reading of my kids when I entered was 5th grade. And the reason for this is very simple. That we have a public education system that is controlled by special interest groups whose business model is keeping kids trapped in failing schools. And then during COVID-19, that business model became keeping schools shut altogether. And so I would want to completely reorient that paradigm to have a public education system that actually serves students that is student centered, that allows parents to have choices as to where they spend their child to school. And that has accountability built into it as well. There are very simple reforms that we can make that other states have made, that an advanced student achievement, that have closed achievement gaps. Yet in California, we have been moving in precisely the opposite direction. And every attempt that I've made to bring meaningful reforms to expand educational opportunity and equity in my role as vice chair of the Assembly Special Education Committee, Assembly Education Committee, hasn't gone anywhere because of the political barriers that are in place. Every candidate talks about, even the governor himself talks about the problem of homelessness in California. How would you tackle that issue? Well, I would actually get serious about the homelessness issue because what we've seen in California is it has just gotten worse and worse even though we've spent enormous sums of money. Just this year, Gavin Newsom dedicated $12 billion more towards homelessness spending. And yet this approach has not worked in California. We see that homelessness is actually improving in other parts of the country while it's getting worse here. In fact, our unsheltered homeless population in California, this is a staggering statistic, is nine times larger than the next closest state. And the governor's own top mental health advisor, even admitted in March of this year that homelessness in California is not a money problem, it's a leadership problem. So I would bring new leadership. I would look at what's worked in other states that's actually on the basis of evidence, improved to be successful in helping people transition out of homelessness and turn their lives around. You need to have a facility where people can go. There needs to be a roof over their head. We can't have people living and dying and languishing on our streets. But once there, we need to connect them with the needed services, whether that's mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, job training, family reunification, and the other measures that have proven to be successful. And let me talk about taxes, state taxes. How do you feel? Are there any increases you actually support? Well, no, I mean, our budget has more than doubled over the last 10 years, well more than doubled. It's now $267 billion. That's what Gavin Newsom just signed. And I talked to people who say, well, yeah, they don't like the taxes that are so high here. But at least if they were getting something in return, that would soften the blow a little bit. But do you walk around and see perfectly paved roads and beautiful dams and reservoirs and sterling public schools? No, of course not. Everything has continued to get worse. The quality of life in California has continued to decline. And that is because we have a capital where spending is not directed towards serving the people of the state. So what I would say is let's get back to basics. Let's pave our roads, manage our forests, maintain our grid, keep our community safe, support our police. Do the things that government is supposed to do. That's my basic pitch to voters of all partisan affiliations is that something much more fundamental than sort of the typical partisan political issues is at stake here. It's about having a government that serves the people. And by the way, this recall election has been kind of pushed back away. And so it's only going to be a year until the next election. So if you're someone who is, let's say, reluctant to cross party lines, then my message is take a chance on change. See it. You're not signing on for four years. You're signing on for one year. See how things work out. And then you know, you'll have an opportunity to reassess in 2022. Well, one thing that is affecting our quality of life and we're certainly paying for it are the wildfires. What's your plan to protect Californians from that growing threat? Yeah. As we speak, the calder fire, which is not far from my district, has engulfed South Lake Tahoe. There's been an evacuation there. I was out, you know, observing the fire just a couple days ago. And it's truly just terrifying scenes that we've become all too accustomed to in California. And unfortunately, this is this is largely because of negligence on the part of the state. You know, our forests have become tinder boxes. Most experts would say we need to be doing a million acres of forest management in a given year. And we're going around boasting about how he was doing 90,000 acres, but in fact an investigation by NPR capital public radio revealed that he was exaggerating by 690%. So I would actually prioritize keeping our forances for us healthy and resilient and removing the obstacles that stand in the way of doing that. Well, finally, I want to give you the chance to tell voters why you deserve to be the next governor. Well, I've been fighting for five years to get our state on the right track. I grew up in California. I was born and raised in California, and I want to keep this a state where folks can stay where they can raise their family where you can retire. But you know, we see that more and more people feel like California isn't that place for them. For the first time in California history this last year, we had more people leave the state than came here. Our population declined. And this used to be the state where anyone can get ahead. Now it's the state that so many people can't wait to leave behind. And so I've been fighting at the Capitol for five years. I've been fighting the last year and a half to have a more public-experited approach to the COVID-19 response. And I'd be ready on day one to answer the call for fundamental change that this recall represents with the tangible reforms we needed at our Capitol and the new direction that we need for our state. Well, Kevin Kylie, thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate it.

        "transcript": " Congressional District 3 now. This is a new district with a wide open seat. You can see it spans from Sierra to Inyo County and includes large areas of Placer County. And looking at the numbers right now for District 3, we have Republican Kevin Kylie versus Democrat Kermit Jones. And there you see the Democrat Kermit Jones has 51% of the vote. ABC10's Van 2 is live tonight in Placer County and Van you're talking to Kermit Jones and Kevin Kylie. Definitely and those were earlier results but I want to show you what's live happening right now. Ballots are still coming in today. Ballots cast today are still coming in. Making their way here to the Placer County election office in Auburn. You can see workers unloading these trucks coming from all over Placer County. Some coming even as far as Tahoe City over this year in very dicey condition. So thank you to Pull Workers Sue Daniels to who sent us a photo showing the dedication to pull this off in the winter storm. So election officials tell us that Cald Trans and the Sheriff's Office, even helping escort and plowing the way to ensure these ballots arrive safely to be counted. These remaining ballots, Republican congressional District 3 candidate, Kevin Kylie, is hoping will turn the tides in his favor. You know I'm feeling pretty good. It's still very early. So we got to wait for the votes to come in. But you know I feel like we gave the campaign everything we could. We got a great response for voters. And I think our message resonated. The folks are looking for change early return. Show first time candidate veteran doctor Kermit Jones with a favorable need. This may turn out to be the surprise of the night. His supporters say they don't believe it is a long shot to send a Democrat to the House of Representatives for this region that has historically leaned Republican. A large chunk of Jones's watch party included dozens of interns who campaigned for him. Although they themselves are too young to vote. There are so many things post Trump era who just can't ignore. Especially as the youth were going to be experiencing all these legislative changes in the next few years. And we're going to be the ones reaping the rewards or not the rewards. Still a tight race. Kylie's supporters say they like what he has done as an assemblyman. He's been a consistent critic of Governor Newsom. Basically, there's a lot of people who stand for American values. And I think Kylie does. In the end, no matter who wins, District 3 will have a new representative in the House. I look at this as an opportunity for them to get real representation and get someone who knows what it's like to fight for people just like I did in the military. That's exactly what I want to do in Congress. And that's what I've been so honored to have such a big team to do. And of course, it won't be decided until every single vote is counted in counties in California have until December 8th to certify their votes. So again, we're here in Auburn at the Plaster County Election Office, where ballots custody are still coming in by the truckloads and as far as Tahoe City. So it will be quite the long night. And of course, a long process to count all of these ballots. A busy night ahead. Of course, it's a race van that's getting national attention. After Kevin Kylie was endorsed by former President Donald Trump still very early. But Democrat Kermit Jones is ahead, as we speak, van, reporting live for us tonight in Plaster County. We thank you.",

So if you want to be part of the school choice mission and you want to help volunteer to get the word out, maybe show up to some events and help spread the word. That would be great. So just go out and talk to the person there about that for school choice. Also some upcoming things we've got going on. Let's see next Wednesday September 8th. Charlie Kirk. Yes. We are blessed to finally be able to have Charlie come into the program. And he's going to be joined by Pastor Rob McCoy as well. So that is what next Wednesday September 8th. Make sure you get here early to be able to get a seat. Also want to let you know we went through a real rough round of closures in this last year of things being shut down and locked down. And not knowing what the future holds exactly. We are developing a movement right now called never closing. You probably heard us talk about this a little bit before. And what this is all about is we want to be able to make our resource for churches and businesses that are committed to the community. And are rejecting the concept of closing down their church or their business if this were to happen again in the event of another lockdown. So what you can do now is go to neverclosing.org. And if you have a business and you want to add your business there because you're going to commit to staying open. And the future no matter what, then you can add your business on there. It's free. If you are watching online and you're part of a church, you can ask your church leadership to go on there and add the church there as well. And this is going to be a great resource for people to find out in the event if any kind of lockdown in the future. What churches and local businesses are open. So never closing.org. If you haven't already joined the email list, the our watch email list, you could do that at ourwatchnow.com. Just add your information there and you will make sure that you will be getting the most current and up to date information about events and future guests coming on the program. You can also find out all those details if you are following us on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter. And if you're watching right now online, you're either watching on YouTube or Rumble. So would you please share this out right now, send out a link to all your social media friends, let them know to join in and watch. Make sure that you're liking and subscribing to the channel as well. And that way you get the notifications about what's coming up and what we're doing here. So also want to let you know for those that are local to this area, if you're part of the church. And actually, even if you're not, we're going to be live streaming this. I just realized that we're going to be live streaming Monday morning is Russia. And so here at the church, Pastor Tim is going to be leading a Bible study. This is just going to be a one time special Bible study at 9 a.m. here at 412, Muryeta. So you can watch that on the 412, Muryeta YouTube and Rumble channel Monday morning at 9 o'clock or come on down and show up and take part in that with us. So that's about all I got for you guys now, we're getting started with the program in just a few moments. So sit back, relax and enjoy our watch with Tim Thompson. So here's the radical left with their globalist mindset has burned down our cities, forced businesses to close and tried to silence our churches. They told us to wear a mask and stay home to save lives in many Christians who remain silent. That is no longer an option. The silent majority will be silent no more and the sleeping giant has been awakened. We are going to use our voice to take back the media, stop the censorship and very loudly take back the public square. I'm Tim Thompson and this is our watch. Well, good evening everybody. I'm so grateful to have you all out here, especially on a holiday weekend like this. We got Labor Day coming up this Monday. There's a lot going on out in the world, but you all took time to come into church and hear what Kevin Kylie has to say tonight and just grateful for you for doing that. I also want to say hello to everybody that's tuned in online. Glad you're with us as well. I just want to remind all of you that are here and everybody that is watching online, why we're doing this. Why would a pastor talk about these political issues? I believe this. I believe what Ezekiel chapter 3 says. In fact, I believe what all of the Bible says, front to back. But I believe Ezekiel 3 where God calls Ezekiel a watchman and he tells him when I warn you about something, it's your job to let everybody know. And if they decide to listen to you and they hear the warnings and they repent and they get their life back on track, then great, you've saved them awesome. But if you don't warn them and they end up dying in their sin, then it's on you. And that's the way I view this. There's a lot going on where we've got our eyes open, we're paying attention to what's going on in our culture and around the world. And the pastors should be telling people, hey, these are the things that God said in His Word that we should be looking for. These are the things that are happening and we need to be very well aware. And so I look at it that way, we are watchmen and we all are watchmen in a sense. And so I want to make sure that we get good information to you and that way you can help sound the alarm to your friends, your family and your neighbors. Amen. Amen. So I do want to thank you for coming out tonight. And I have with me tonight a very special guest that's going to invite up our guest tonight. Many of you have seen her. She's been on our watch before. She's been here with her husband, Dr. Jeff Barkey. This is Mary Barkey. She's on the Orange County Board of Education. And so that's a huge thing for especially for us at our watch because you know the heart that we have for children and how open our eyes are to what they're doing to indoctrinate our kids. And that's been just a huge thing for us because we've literally been calling the public school system the indoctrination factory. And so it's just a blessing to know that there are people like you who will bring a voice of reason to the Orange County Board of Education. And the Orange County Board actually has some pretty good people on that. I'm wishing that the actual individual school districts would get people like you on them. But this is a massive fight we're in. You've been definitely helping to lead the charge and that we're grateful for you. And so Mary Barkey, would you please introduce up your friend and our guest this evening? I'd love to do that. Thank you all for being here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to introduce my favorite candidate for Governor. Don't tell anybody but he's definitely my favorite. He's an amazing assemblyman. He is the son of a special needs teacher. He was a teacher himself in Los Angeles. He is an attorney. He was the guy who sued the governor and won. Yes. Gotta love that. And he is out there fighting for us every single day. The reason we had to invite you here on the weekend rather than our normal Wednesday is because during the week he's fighting for us in the assembly. He's one of the few people there that fights for the kids. He fights for school choice. He fights for freedom. And I know on day one he's going to remove the emergency order that will give all of us our freedom back. So I'm very, very excited to introduce to you tonight assemblyman Kevin Kylie. Thank you very much. Thank you for coming out. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I'm very excited to be here on the weekend. I want to ask you another question which to me was probably the single most intriguing thing about you was the fact that you sued our governor in the midst of the pandemic. It was my pleasure. It was our pleasure as well. I want to read just a portion of what was put out by the courts that day. I want to have you because you've got multiple degrees, Harvard, Gale, and I have some education degree because I was a teacher for a while. I want to read this and then we'll have you explain this. Here's what it says executive order and 6720 issued by the governor on June 3, 2020 is void as an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power and shall be no further force or effect. The California Emergency Services Act does not authorize or empower the governor of the state of California to amend statutory law or make new statutory law which is exclusively a legislative function not delegated to the governor under the CESA. Go ahead and unpack that for us. I didn't understand any of that. This was the ruling that came down from a superior court in Northern California. We had and it was James Gallagher and I, who's another member of the legislature who represents the district in Northern California. Great assembly member. We actually represented ourselves. The legislature decided we're not going to work anymore so it adjourned indefinitely. We decided to do something about this because he decided to rule the state by decree. He was issuing executive order after executive order. A lot of things that had nothing to do with COVID. We had to do something about this as legislators. These are our powers actually. Make laws. That's the way it's supposed to work. You learn about it in school. We have an executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch. We decided to sue him and we also said, well, we're lawyers by trade. Why don't we just represent ourselves? We went and got a preliminary injunction initially. The trial ended up being in November and we wrote all the briefs ourselves. Did all the arguments ourselves and whatnot. It was actually one of the most amazing days of my life when we arrived for this trial. We're preparing for all of this in obscurity. We were just writing these briefs. Hundreds of pages of briefs that we did by the time this thing was over. I show up at the courthouse and it's completely packed the parking lot. I have to park some place off that I get there and there's just hundreds and hundreds of people who have showed up to support us at this trial and to support this effort to rain the government. I would later learn that it was mostly led by the building recall movement. We ended up winning the trial and the finding by the judge was that the particular order we had challenged. There was a lot we could have challenged. It was unconstitutional not within the governor's powers and she issued a restraining order saying he can't do things like this going forward. In my view, that would have been applicable to things like the lockdowns as well. If you're going to do something like that which is not even clear you should be able to do it all. If you're going to, then the legislature needs to be involved. The government can't just come up with it and then impose it on everyone else. Long story short, he ended up getting a favorable panel of judges on the third district court of the peels. They all worked, all three of them had worked for governors and they ended up reversing that decision. Then in what is truly shocking to me, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the case. It was four justices pointed by Jerry Brown, one by Gavin Newsom. And that shocked you that they refused to hear the case? Well, that doesn't shock me. Shock is maybe the wrong word. I just think it's so unacceptable that there you go. You'll get other states where there have been challenges to governors overreach of authority which has been known or close to what Gavin Newsom has done. However, they've come out. It's the state's highest court that has always decided the issue. This is the issue of our time. Whether we are going to just surrender the form of government that has worked pretty well in this country for 200 plus years. We decide, well, we're just going to let this opinion from three randomly chosen justices randomly, I can say quote-unquote, on the third district court of the peels to have the binding decision on this. That's why I say now we're seeking justice at the ballot box. That's what the opportunity we have in 10 days. On the side note on this, one of the most important powers of governor has is the power to appoint judges. And I had a point of judges who actually respect the Constitution. Sort of a novel idea. He did, by the way, Gavin Newsom. Just yesterday, he went on like a judge appointing bid. She appointed 23 judges. And so I don't know, maybe he thinks he might not have the power to appoint judges pretty soon. Right. Yeah, that's pretty telling. Yeah, that's crazy. The American dream is something that's important to me. You may know Mike Morel, former senator, and a good friend of mine. And one of the things that he's always said, the first time he said it, just like it resonated in my mind. And I've never let it go. Biblically. So you know him. You know he's a man that God's word flows out of his mouth. He just, it's in his heart, so it comes out of his mouth. The Bible tells us that a good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children. And what Mike Morel told me, it says, you know, Tim, it's more than mine. We need to be able to leave an America to our children's children. The kind of America that we got, the privilege to grow up in. And we're seeing that being stripped away really quick. And there's two amendments that, to me, are the ones that are just flashing right. Now that it's so obvious that they're trying to be stripped from us. And I want to get your take on it. If you were to be governor, we've got the first amendment and the second amendment. You know, gun rights are being stripped from Californians constantly. If you were a governor, what would you do to ensure that our first and our second, well, all our rights? But specifically, because these are the ones we see are very much under attack. What would you do to ensure that we get to maintain our first and second amendment rights? And as someone who's soon to be a grandfather, I understand, you know, that quote probably has some resonance with the erase. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. So, I mean, you're absolutely right that we have a state government that even before COVID would run roughshod over our constitutional rights. Let's, I mean, we could go through them all. But we'll start with the first amendment. You know, obviously there have been attacks on religious liberty that predate even the COVID shutdowns. It's been building for a long time. There has been, they've gone after, for example, the private Christian colleges time and again. I've got one of them in my district, William, just a university. And the United States Supreme Court even had to strike down a couple years ago, a California law on first amendment grounds, which required crisis pregnancy centers. You're familiar with this law. I'm sure to post at their facility where the nearest plant parenthood was or where you could obtain access to an abortion. This is a law passed and signed by the state of California. The United States Supreme Court struck that down on first amendment grounds. Neta Hagerra is the attorney that worked on that. And she's a friend of ours. She actually are attorney here at the church. Oh, is that right? Yes. Okay. Yeah. And it was, then it was Go mobile for life, which was a mobile ultrasound thing that got absorbed by birth choice. I'm on the board for birth choice. So we were very familiar with that case and it was something that we were celebrating. I mean, just what a great win. That's an incredible win. Yes. And it was a very important one. And that was, it was actually on free speech grounds. Because the first amendment, of course, protects your right to freedom of speech against government interference. It also means that the government cannot force you to engage in speech that runs against, you know, your values. And so forcing them to do that, the US Supreme Court said, was a violation of the first amendment. So the first amendment has five freedoms in it. There's speech, there's, you know, for free exercise and the establishment clause. And I think that, you know, one of the, I think, important opportunities we have right now in California is that we have just seen over the course of the last year and a half, kind of everything that was already wrong here, taken to the nth degree, like put on steroids. And so we had attacks on religious liberty for a long time in California. Then we had the very worst, you know, violations of religious liberty in any state in the country during COVID-19. As I'm sure you're well aware, the US Supreme Court had to slap down Gavin Newsom's orders five times, you know, not only related to churches, but to in-home Bible studies and other private gatherings. And so I think that, you know, this is a chance for us as a people to reject what he did during COVID, but to also turn the page on this long standing, these long standing abuses, the long standing disparagement of religious freedom by putting worship and fellowship beyond the reach of any bureaucrat. So we've covered a few of the first amendment freedoms over the second amendment. One last thing on the first one, because you're talking about the compelled speech. Yes. It can't force you to say something that goes against your own convictions. Right. That being said, what we're finding in the state is laws that have been created because there is a super majority in the state legislator against people like me. Laws have been created that really has been bad for conservative teachers, take, for instance, a transgender issue. You know, telling a teacher if you don't use a preferred pronoun, if you could see clearly that the child is a male child, but the child wants to be referred to by female pronouns, and you don't use that, then you can be in big trouble as a teacher in California. What are your thoughts on that type of compelled speech? Because that is not something that's going to go away anytime soon instead of California. Yeah, that's an interesting point. And, you know, it's another example of what is so fundamentally wrong about the way education works in California is that you have that level of minutia regulated at the state level telling every teacher, every school in the state, that this is what you have to do. That's not the way it ought to work, which is why I'm a huge advocate for school choice. And I think that's another way in which, you know, we need to use sort of this last year and a half where we've reached kind of the maximum level of government of use with schools just being closed altogether to turn the page on the abuses that it already been building up. And I think that that's what I already had, you know, among the worst public schools in the country, even before COVID. So I think that at the end of the day, if you have a robust, meaningful system of school choice, then if that sort of thing is going on, then you can take your child or in the funding goes with the mouse running for a teacher, you can go and teach it another venue where those sort of things don't happen. So I think that's actually introduced some very significant legislation on the subject of school choice. Yes. How is that going for you? Well, they refused to even hear it. Can you believe that? They did not give even legislators a choice over school choice legislation. This is the way our legislature works. It's the same thing with, you've probably heard of AB 455, which we've managed to kill for the year. So they just kind of come up with this two weeks before the legislature adjourned and turn a toll road bill into, you know, this thing that runs completely contrary to America's founding value, something that's never happened in this country before. And so our legislature, I mean, I've been there five years. I can tell you, it's a total shame. Like we do not have a true representative process in this state, which is kind of like why it wasn't such a big deal that the legislature moral has disappeared last year. So it's it's robious and special interest who run it anyway. So maybe it's just easier if they tell the governor directly what they want to do. Okay. You know, Gavin Newsom, you shut down the schools. Then we don't have to wrangle with 120 different legislators. So I am supporting an initiative on the ballot next year that is going to actually put funding, you know, have the funding follow the student. And I think that with, you know, the recall, if it is successful, and then that initiative on the horizon, there will actually be an opportunity to try to induce the legislature to pass some form of meaningful school choice. Yeah. School choice is going to be a massive issue for us. Come that come that if we can get that on the ballot. We have to find a way to take back control from the CTA, take back control with these local unions, local associations, because that is the, I call the public school system, the indoctrination factory. That's this works at and we have to be able to find a way to create competition within the schools. That's right. And that's what school choice will do. You mentioned AB 455 is dead till next year. We still have AB 1102 with that. Where's that one at? So not entirely clear. The language still is not in print, which is incredible. The legislature adjourns for the year on Friday, and you're going to try to ram this thing through, which still at this moment, what's today Saturday. The legislature adjourns in less than a week, and you're going to have this bill go through. I mean, there's no opportunity for public input, public deliberation. I mean, even the bare sort of remnants of those things that we have in our ordinary legislative process doesn't exist. And, you know, that is I think another sort of overarching theme of the recall is that this is a chance to bring power back to the people, to reclaim control over our state government. And, you know, a year and a half when we've been told your voice does not matter. The only voice that matters is one person's Gavin Newsom's. He's going to issue order after order after order. And that means you need to shut down your church, pastor. Sorry, it's nothing you could do about it. You need to shut down your small business. Yeah, exactly. I'm going to run them. Okay, so second amendment. We didn't. We have like the craziest gun laws in the country in California. I've got a perfect rating from all the second amendment groups, but it's really not that hard just because what's being proposed is just so clearly bad that it's, you know, there's no question of whether to vote against it. But, and I've also proposed some legislation to try to strengthen second amendment rights. So, and ironically, you know, there is one group who sort of is being treated kind of well when it comes to firearms. That's criminals. When it comes to the use of guns in the commission of crimes, somehow we keep lowering the penalties for that or not really taking it seriously when felons are improperly in possession of firearms. Or with prop 47, stealing a gun was lowered from a felony to a misdemeanor. And so we have been continually making law-abiding citizens into criminals by changing the laws overnight. So what you've got in your safe is suddenly contraband. And then at the same time, we're sort of making non-criminals out of people who are actually committing crimes. Yeah, especially in the county of Los Angeles. Yeah, because that gas going, I mean, just if you haven't looked into what the DA in Los Angeles is doing, just do a quick Google search, you'll find it is totally nefarious what's happening out there in Los Angeles. We've got to thank God that we live in Riverside County for those of us that are here right now, living here with an amazing DA, Mike Hestrin, and an incredible sheriff, Chavionko. What a dynamic duo those guys are. So let's talk about medical freedom, which I know for my audience is a huge issue. And right now we're seeing with the AB 455, the AB 1102. So these are trying to snake this in and force us to get the vaccines. I've got so many people that go to this church that I passed her and just my online audience that I talk with that are fearful. And we actually were the first church in the state of California. We were the first church to come out with a doctrine against the mRNA. That was for us with our belief system. Unfortunate for us, what happened was the Wall Street Journal wrote an article about it, which went across the nation. And then our phone service and our email service was flooded with people who wanted this religious exemption form. And that just shows you, people all over the states are calling this little church in Marietta going, I need that. So to us, this is a huge issue and it's an issue of freedom. And for me, it's an issue of, I want my religious beliefs respected. So if you were elective governor, what would you do to ensure our medical freedoms? Well, number one is I terminate the state of emergency. That has the first thing I do. It's a year and a half and that has a couple of things. First, I think it's just, it's an important symbol saying, you know, we're getting on with our lives. We're not going to live with this pandemic mentality forever. And other states have terminated their states of emergency. It's time. And that, but secondly, and more importantly, that is what is being used as the predicate for all of these emergency orders at the state and local level. And the way that our emergency services law works. And by the way, I wouldn't just choose to terminate the state of emergency. I would feel obligated to terminate the state of emergency. Our law, the emergency services act. That's what the CESA was referring to in that opinion you read earlier. It says that the governor must terminate the state of emergency. And that's what the state of emergency should do. We know how it works. There is no need to have a state of emergency. Everyone knows how to protect themselves. And so once what the law says is that as soon as the emergency ends, then all state and local emergency orders issued on or wiped out automatically. And so in my view, that would include these mandates at every level of government. But what if a private corporation says, you know what, I know that the state's not mandating it, but we're going to mandate it for our employees. If you want to work at our company, you have to have this. I don't care about your religious liberties. I don't care what your church, that crazy 412 church over there. I don't care what that maniac pastor says. This is what people write about me, by the way. So what would you do to ensure that that can't happen because that really truly is a violation of our religious liberty? Yeah, it's a trickier issue. And it does kind of highlight a broader issue, which is that corporate power has in many ways become, you know, maybe not as much of a threat, but a threat that is similar in some ways to sort of a concentrated government power. Social media, a very clear example of that. It's a democracy. Exactly. And you see, you know, this censorship, which I believe on like Facebook and Twitter has actually become a first amendment issue, and it's one of the most important issues of our time, is to try to restore proper freedom of speech through those channels, since that's where so much of public discourse takes place. But to your question, so it is a trickier issue. I think that, you know, for the governor, it's this sort of unilaterally decree that private companies can't do this. I'm not sure that would be within the bounds of what a governor could do on his or her own. I think that, you know, if the legislature were willing to take steps in that direction, it'd be a different story. Yeah, well, we saw, you know, Governor DeSantis in Florida, he came out strong like that for the people saying, no, we're not going to allow that. We're not going to allow people to do that. Yeah, whether he gets the backing of the state legislature or not, I don't know. But it's definitely an issue that I have, I have a church filled with people that are worried about that. Yeah. So a massive concern for them. So just know that, that if you're to get elected, that's something we really care a lot about. We want our religious liberties. We want our beliefs to be respected. One of the things I was talking to you about because I've been involved in political issues prior to COVID and one of those massive things for me, for me was the AB 329. That's the comprehensive sexuality training, which is so it's not sex ed, like like many of us got when we were in school, the birds and the bees and, you know, the biology of it, but it's actual sexual training. Like how to be sexual, how to enjoy sex, things like that. And once that was introduced, all sorts of filth was allowed at a greater level. It was already happening on public school systems or public school campuses, but it just went on steroids. It was the, you know, that was the COVID, that was the pandemic in the schools then was the AB 329. So what would you do? Because I know that you've helped with new laws, you've helped with the freedom of speech, the criminal justice reform protections for sexual assault victims. These are all things that matter to you. And then obviously school choice. So what do you say about the sexual indoctrination that's clearly taking place on our school campuses? Yeah, I mean, some of these materials are just truly shocking. And, you know, I certainly am opposed to SB 329. That was a bill that was passed by the legislature and signed by the governor, but actually a lot of the stuff that you're seeing comes from the Board of Education and the various, you know, committees they've set up to produce the curriculum. So there is power, you know, within the executive branch, which the governor leads to potentially change some of that, which I think needs to happen. But, you know, but this gets it at another issue. I mean, in addition to the broader principle of school choice, you know, there's also the matter of kind of where decision making power resides. And with that, you have an example of this really radical curriculum that's being devised in Sacramento and then forced upon every community throughout the state. So what happens? You know, you as a parent go to your school board member who might be someone that you know, or at least is more accessible than, you know, let's say the governor or someone in Sacramento. And you say, I don't want this to be taught to my kids. And what do they tell you? They say, well, there's not a lot we can do about it. This is a mandate that's coming down to us from Sacramento. And so that's what we need to change. I mean, I think that the most important job of the next governor is to make it less important who the governor is. And then I think that's not turning power to local communities and their citizens, right? Right. Yeah, and that's like the never ending circle I was in. I would go to the school board, they say, hey, well, we have no say you got to go talk to California Board of Education. So I fly up to Sacramento and talk to them, they go, no, this is a local issue. You got to go talk to your school board. And I go back to school board. No, they said that I have to talk to you. Well, they go, no, and our hands are tied. And it's just, it's this. Exactly. And the thing is, it shouldn't be like that. So one of the things I resolved to do is say, I'm not flying up to Sacramento anymore. I'm starting with the school board. I'm not moving from the school board until a, they'll do it what we want as a community or b, we replace them and put somebody in there that will do what we want as a community. And once we get them on board, then we can go start going up the ladder. And so that's the approach we're going to take, but you're absolutely right. We got to put the power back where it should be. And that is local because all politics are local. Another thing within the public school system and obviously it's not just public schools. This is everywhere in every woke corporation, but critical race theory has become a big issue. And I actually brought out a book that, that one of our, what Pastor Simon, our executive pastor here at the church, he found this at a local store and, and it's called our skin. And it's a children's book and you open it up. And it essentially just said that white people came up with the idea of race and white people think that they're better. They're in prettier and deserve more and all those nonsense. And this is the stuff that's being pumped into the minds of our young kids, dividing them up on race when, when we as Christians say, I don't want you to divide us up on race. We believe what Acts chapter 17 says that from one blood, God made all people. And so we're all, we're all people. We're all part of the human race. And we don't want to divide by race, but then they, they go, oh, your racist then. No, you're the one being racist. So where, where do you stand on that and what steps could you take as governor to ensure that critical race theory gets squashed on the state level? Well, I, I adamantly oppose it. And there's a bill right now in the legislature, as you may know, that would not only allow CRT to be taught in schools, but they would require it for every high school student as a graduation requirement or ethnic studies. That's what they're calling it. But so here's an interesting thing that many people are not aware of. I was asked recently in an interview, can you name one thing that Gavin Newsom did right? And that was a really hard question. I just thought about it. By the way, he's my constituent, Gavin Newsom is, he lives in, I'm his assemblyman, lives in my district. For now anyway. And so that I, it occurred to me. One thing he's done right is that he was against CRT two years ago when the original version of this curriculum was released. It wasn't just him. It was everyone. It was universally connected. What is this Newsom said it is offensive in so many ways. And it will never see the light of day. That's what he said. The head of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, which is 12 Democrat legislators, said that the curriculum quote, echoes the propaganda of the Nazi regime. And so you'd think, well, we should scrap this whole thing right now. And maybe we should figure out who came up with it and see whether they should keep their jobs with cancel culture and everything these days. People have lost their careers for things a lot less serious than trying to teach Nazi propaganda to high school students. But now that's not what happened. They said, we'll make a few tweaks, we'll make a few edits, we'll tone down the anti-Semitism a little bit. Then we'll impose it on every high school student in California. That bill is wending its way through the legislature. I think it will come to a final vote this week. And then Gavin Newsom will make a decision on whether to sign or veto that bill. And unfortunately, you probably won't have a new governor before that decision gets made. But you certainly could try to roll it back if he does sign the bill. But I'll just make one final point on this, which is that we need to fight to defeat CRT. That is one of the most important issues right now, I think that we face. But I think that our goal needs to be bigger than that. What we really need to do is to restore civics in our schools, true civic education. That's what CRT and this agenda has exposed. It's exposed to vacuum that we don't teach civics like we used to. We used to think about education in terms of for tearing our kids for citizenship to be participants in the great American experiment of self-government to understand why America is the greatest country in the world what our founding principles and values are. So that they'd be prepared to be active citizens in their communities. And we don't do that anymore. And so CRT has come along. And it's like exploiting that vacuum. It's saying, well, I call it the anti civics. If we're no longer going to teach our kids how to build their communities up, then we'll teach them how to tear their communities down. And so we need to defeat CRT, but we also need to start teachings of X-A-Vix again. I agree. Great. Businesses. I know several people going through the last 18 months, businesses that they work their whole life trying to build up and it seemed like overnight they lost them. So what would you do to try to ensure that that never happens again and also to try to create an environmental environment of capitalism. An environment where people go, hey, look, I can achieve the American dream if I'm willing to work hard and sacrifice and continue to strive to do well. I can make something to myself here in California because a lot of people are leaving California because they think there's just no way. I can't make anything of themselves that got to go to another state. And I keep telling them, don't leave, stay and fight. Stay in the line. We've got to stay and fight. But what would you do to try to ensure that there's that kind of environment where people go, okay, I can achieve that American dream. Right. Right. I like the way you ask that question because California has always been sort of where the full glory of the American dream is realized. Right. It used to be the state where anyone could get ahead and now it's the state that so many people can't wait to leave behind. Last year, our population declined for the first time in California's 170 year history and not just by a little bit, by 182,000 people. And you talk about businesses. This is yet another example of sort of the theme of California kind of already being the worst at something and then being like the worst of the worst during the COVID era. So we already were the worst when it came to how we treat small businesses, but then we had the worst lockdowns of any state in the country. And what's the result over the first half of this year, the number of business departures from California has doubled to what it was before. And it was already a lot before. So, you know, I say Gavin Newsom, you know, has brought what was a long term decline kind of into this total free fall. And, you know, the idea that California is anti business really, you know, needs to be more specific because it really is anti small business. Right. A lot of major corporations, they like regulations. A lot of major corporations, they were exempted from lockdowns. Hollywood was exempted from lockdowns. You see that video from Angela Marson in LA where her restaurant was closed outdoor dining and they got a film set across the street. I mean, that is California government in a nutshell, you know, it's the powerful who benefit. And so big corporations, they can deal with the onslaught of regulations and everything because they have in house compliance departments, they have attorneys on staff who can help them avoid litigation risks, they have big margins and can avoid the cost. They welcome this as barriers to entry for small businesses. But we've seen before COVID and we saw, especially during COVID, is it's the sort of, you know, the mom and pop store that's been on the same street corner for generations that creates the character of the company. It creates the character of the community that brings the community together. That's who is who paid the price. Those are the establishments that died and drove. So how do we turn it around? Well, I think it's the same thing as when it comes to religious liberty and when it comes to economic freedom. Is we need to not only, you know, correct the abuses of the last year and a half but turn the page on the whole reverse the whole trajectory that we've been on. I could give you, you know, some very clear examples of how we do that over turn AB five, which is a ban on the dependent contract and was absolutely devastated. A lot of freelancers. There are things like the private attorney general's act, which is a huge, you know, which puts a lot of, a lot of companies out of business. And then you could sort of go through the code. I mean, and that's one thing a governor can do is a lot of the damage is done at the level of agencies turning out regulations. And as the governor, you're the leader of those agencies, the leader of the executive branch. So you could immediately start to create an environment that is actually supportive of small business rather than continually attacking them. All right. Yeah. I wish I could say that I already know the answer to this question because you're a Christian. But unfortunately, I've had a lot of people who even fly, they do what I call fly the banner of Christianity. I'm a Christian, but then when you get down to where they stand on issues, they might not necessarily stand on what the Bible would say. So would you consider yourself to be pro-life? Yes. Okay. So let me, let me qualify that. I want to make sure that we're both on the same page. What the answer, yes, means in the case of rape. Woman's been raped. Or in the case of a woman's health being in jeopardy. Are you still against abortion with those two? So those are harder issues because there's a federal law relating to that and the high-demand, which is- Well, I'm not talking about with the laws. I'm just talking about you personally, your belief system. Because as Christians, we want to vote for somebody who's closest to the heart of God. So I know what the federal laws are because I said I'm on the board for birth choice. And so knowing that, you've got to know I'm, you know, life is an important issue to me. But we don't have to agree on everything. Right. I just want to know for you and who you are, what's your thoughts? I mean, I think that if you comment sort of the pro-life position from the perspective that the unborn child is a life that is, you know, it's the responsibility of the government to protect, then sort of the manner of conception probably shouldn't factor into the analysis. Okay. I agree, by the way. What about the woman's health, though? What about that? Those are harder questions, I think, because then there's, you know, there's a real balance that needs to be struck. So I don't know what your opinion. Well, what I say is this is when you leave room for abortion on any level, especially when it comes to woman's health, that's such an ambiguous term. Because now you're leaving it up to who to determine what is the woman's health condition, is it just that she's stressed out from being pregnant and, you know, the stress is causing her to lose some hair and, you know, it's just stress is bad for you. So this is bad for her health. You could get a doctor that says, yeah, it's bad for her health. Go ahead and do the abortion. It's so ambiguous that, to me, it's not, you're not drawing the line clear enough. Right. So for me, I look at it exactly what you said previously is if we can determine that it is a human life at all levels, then it's a human life, and it is the government's responsibility to protect it. Especially as we grow further and further down the road of understanding science, you know, we look at, so I'm a bit older than you. So I'm a different generation, but my generation, I'm Gen X, Gen X, so my generation was not very pro-life, but you look at, you know, like my son is a millennial, I have a daughter who's Gen Z. Their generations are actually more pro-life than my generation. The reason they're more pro-life is because of the understanding of science. Because they understand that DNA is a digital code. They understand that everybody's digital code, everybody's DNA is unique to them. And so they understand that once that's for a means that egg, there is a unique digital code that is that person. And that's why you're seeing that advancement and understanding of DNA and how that works, you're seeing that they understand that's an individual person. So once that unique DNA is formed, that's a whole other person. And that person has rights, and those rights need to be protected wherever they're at in their development. Wherever that DNA is, you know, from that point until it ends up dying, it's that person. So that's how I view it. But I appreciate you saying that at those levels, at any level of that development, this is the government's role to defend that person. So I appreciate that. Let me ask you as far as the border. Obviously a border is a huge issue right now. And some people will say, well, that's not a biblical issue. Why do you care? It's absolutely a biblical issue. Again, Acts chapter 17 where I said that from one blood, God made all people. Not only did He make all people, but it says that He defined the boundaries of their inhabitation. Where He defined the borders. God's the one that sets them up. And so if God's the one that sets those up, God's the one that determines it, then to me, that's a God issue. That's a Bible issue. Any attempt to tear it down is just going against God's words. So to me, borders are important. Pastors should be talking about it. But I understand that there's the political side of borders as well. So right now we've got obscene numbers of people violating our laws and coming across the border. And that is, in my opinion, is because of failed presidency, namely Joe Biden. You know, because we look at how it was going. I was not clear to me. I was just making sure that everybody that hears me online. I know you all know what I'm talking about. But, you know, the thing is, this is a problem. It's a problem for our state in particular being a border state. This is a problem. And it's not getting better. It seems to be getting worse. What would you do as governor to ensure that the laws would be followed? Well, I do everything I could because I mean, it's absolutely, you know, a untenable situation. What we have right now with everything associated with it, you know, not only the inflow of people, but the issues related to human trafficking related to drugs, not to mention COVID-19, by the way. And what we've seen is the consequences of this change in policy. So what could a governor at the state level do within the constraints of state power? Well, I do everything I could using state authority to try to staunch the flow of people coming in. There are limits to that. And I take the constitutional limits very seriously because I've been very critical of the other side for intruding upon those. Very clear example of that, sanctuary state. This is what they decided to do in 2017. And I would want to, I fought against that as my first year in the legislature, which is just a terrible law. Terrible law. I mean, what it does, it specifically applies to criminal, you know, in undocumented immigrants. So it doesn't apply to anyone but them, but people who number one are in the country in the state illegally. And number two, have been detained for a criminal offense. It carves out a special protection in law for them to prevent your local law enforcement from alerting federal immigration authorities. It's a terrible, terrible law. And no one, you know, for decades has what would have ever, you know, supported anything like that. We've always agreed that the first on the list for people who need to be deported are those who have committed crimes. This is a basic idea. And then you have all of these benefits as well. Like the governor just signed a bill that provided an unprecedented expansion of medical for undocumented immigrants. None of this is helping the situation. No, it's not. So what do you think the solution is though? Well, apart from, you know, having new policy at the federal level. I mean, I think that the things that I just mentioned need to be undone. So I would want to fight the sanctuary state bill and every way I could. You'd need to get a new law for it to be overturned, but the governor could potentially sort of ease up enforcement or provide ways to get around. In fact, a lot of local law enforcement departments have done just that. They found ways around it. And it certainly stopped any further expansion. Try to rule back some of the benefits that are in place. And then you know, you've seen some governors get creative in terms of what they can do to use their own personnel to assist at the border. And so I would certainly be interested in looking at what I could legally do there. Yeah, so we watch what happened with with governor Abbott and his border issue there. Government trying to say, well, hey, you do the testing, the COVID testing. And we'll just reimburse you to do it. And he's like, no, this is this is your job. This is a federal issue regarding the border. You do your job. We haven't heard much from Gavin Newsom. As far as what's going on on our border, one of the things I know for sure, we actually I did a video with a nurse several months back that ended up going viral. And it actually sparked a Senate hearing on the issue of the border because they were flying patients from from down in callexico. They would just cross over going to our hospital. We put them on a helicopter to fly them here into our county. And it was they would count them as a COVID patient there in that county. Then when they fly them to our county, they count them as a COVID patient in our county. And there was flights going every 15 minutes. And we were tracking it on the on the app where you can track flights. We were seeing the helicopters all throughout the night. And they were doing it at night so that way people wouldn't see it. So we so what happened with the hearing what are they? Well, they brought out all sources statistics and it shed a lot of light on it, but it's nothing's happened. It's still happening as you know, you know, our border is just totally porous at this point. And we were getting numbers. There's over 100,000 people every day that cross our border every single day. That's not all illegal, but I mean, there's over 100,000 people every day that cross our border. That's a massive amount of people. And what we're finding is it is it is a huge problem for the COVID issue because they're not being tested. Here we are. We're being told to be tested every two times a week. If you want to have your job and not have a vaccine, you got to be tested. But then the borders open and they're just flooding across. That is that is very poor mismanagement on our state. I think that fault rests on Gavin Newsom. So should you become governor, then we're going to be looking to you. Okay, what are you going to do to stop that from happening? Right. And I'll tell you this, I'm not, I'm not against immigration. I just want immigration to be done properly. I want people to do it legally. And I know this for a fact because I've been involved in trying to help people get their family here from another country. Because I was involved in doing missions work. When you don't involve in doing missions work, people go over as missionaries and they end up getting married and they have kids in that state or in that in that nation. Then they want to come home to America and they can't, they have trouble getting their kids here. And the system is broken. The system is flawed in many ways. I mean, some of these questions like are ridiculous. There's no question about ISIS, no question about anything. But they're asking about are you a part of the Nazi Communist Party? Like, what? Like that's a long time ago. That shouldn't even be a question on there anymore. But they're asking those because it's been so long since they revamped any of these things. And it's really, really difficult to do it legally. Yeah, extremely difficult. And I think that's wrong. We need to change that. But this would, if you become governor, that's the fact is being at the top is lonely. Well, it's lonely because the buck stops with you and that's true. And I think that, you know, that's inherent to political leadership is that you have to make difficult to solicit choices. And people are not everyone's going to be happy. In fact, I'm pretty sure that, you know, everyone in this room could probably find at least one vote I've made in my thousands of votes that you disagreed with. That's the way it is. But I think that what you can do in leadership is, you know, is the way you reach decisions is often just as important as the decisions you make. And bringing as many people as possible into the process. And I think is vitally important. And kind of like what I was saying before, you could also sort of decentralize the locus of decision making down to the level that is as close to the affected communities as possible. And that's where we think we've gone so haywire over the last year and a half in particular. But even before that is that, you know, decisions that affect people's lives in such direct and intimate ways are being made from afar. And my favorite making decisions at the level as local as possible. And by the way, the most local level of decision making is that of the individual citizen. Right. Amen to that. That's something we can't ever forget here in America. Okay, we're running that time. I want to just give you an opportunity. Look, we know there is a lot of bad stuff going on. So as we close, just leave us with some encouragement. What could you give us to walk away from tonight feeling encouraged? Well, look, that's not hard at all because we have a golden opportunity right now in 10 days to set the state on a whole new course. I mean, I, you know, I've been in the legislature for five years and I've been fighting against the corruption of the supermajority and everything else for five years. And right now we have a chance to just completely change the game. And it's not because of anything that politicians like me have done. It's not because of anything that the state party has done. It's because of what people like you have done folks who are in your communities and have said enough is enough. We're going to fight back stay in fight. I love that you said that pastor because that's exactly what we see happening. And I think that, you know, I've been traveling the state quite a bit turns out it's a big state. In the two months since I started this campaign, I've been to the most conservative communities. I've been to the most liberal communities. I had one day where I was in Bakersfield and Santa Cruz. Unbelievable amounts of energy everywhere. And the thing about the recall is it's not something that's just, I mean, of course it's driven by anger and frustration. And everything else that, you know, we've had to go through over the last year and a half of course it's driven by dislike, shall we say, but forgive and do some. But this is not a movement that's purely about negative emotions. What I see, you know, most of all is a sense of optimism and hope that actually we're going to demonstrate the power of a free people to make tomorrow better than today. And I think that when California does that, it's going to send shock waves across the nation that, you know, we're going to come out of this dark year of government control. We'll light a new spark of liberty. I agree with you 100%. I've been saying this for a long time. We're going to see a great awakening here in America. And when you study the great awakenings that have happened previously, there's always been a high concentration where it, where it begins and then it goes throughout the rest of the country like in the first great awakening. It was New York and they had the burned over district in New York. And burned over because people were on fire spiritually. So that was what that was. And I believe with this great awakening, California is going to be that epicenter. I really truly believe that. So thank you for sharing that. Thank you for spending your time with us tonight. I hope you can hang out. I can't be people to love. I know you guys want to get a chance to talk with them. Thank you for your questions. Thank you so much. And God bless you and God bless you. All right. All right. You guys. Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thank you very much. All right. I want to just remind you don't forget this coming Wednesday. We've got Charlie Kirk coming out.

        "transcript": " Yeah, it's great to be flanked by our local assembly member Jim Cooper, my colleague Gerard Hathman, right? I guess two districts out for it, but represents the coast of Northern California. So Jim let me just get back to you for a second. Hey, I'm a left one, Sacramento. I think you're 52 years. You're an uproar for 26 years. Amibera is an amazing commenter. He's a big job for us in Sacramento. And I really want to say thank you guys so much. The Marine Office is always great to have the re-election for top, but without volunteers in our staff, wouldn't be who we are without you. You make a big difference in that. And like I said, even today working in the building, staff makes you volunteers make you. So thank you so much. There's so many things you can be doing today out watching football, minor is on right now, which is out here. And helping this men be elected. He's in a great job for California. And for out row in the Sacramento region, we want to see him back in Congress. So Dr. Barra, I'm most up in respect for you. You'll have near me. We both are open over at the moment, but really just to thank you guys so much. You guys, the difference is making your hard work. Every door you knock on, it's true what makes the engine go. So thank you, thank you for the new for on me and everybody else. And good job. And we can't wait to get it 48 hours to go. And it's a wrap. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're a pleasure. That's now. Jared and I came into Congress together as freshmen in 2012 and we could get a read there. Class of 2012. I am really proud to serve in your congressman, Ami Barra. And you're obviously one of the most critical battleground districts in America. I hope everybody realizes that and the gravity and the energy that should come from that. But the interesting thing is in every key battleground in America right now, really famous important people are getting the campaign trust. So I think last night Tim Kane was campaigning with Bon Jovi and Hillary Clinton was with JZ and Beyonce last night in Ohio. Today she was with LeBron James and here in Ami Barra's district, he's got all of us. So that's exciting. I think. And another thing that's exciting for all of us that kind of have been riding the roller coaster of this crazy election and you know that roller coaster took a crazy plunge with FBI director James Comey about a week ago. In case you haven't heard about an hour ago, Comey wrote a new letter to Congress said basically never mind. No charges, no new investigation. We're back on track. The distraction is gone and we can now work on doing the work that we have to do door door on the phone to bring home this victory. And the only thing I want to say about you and about Ami and about this district is if there's one place in America where you can almost guarantee a photo finish. It's right there. So you hear about these hypothetical races where it's just a few votes per precinct and you know sometimes down to these crazy small margins, you can almost guarantee that in this race. So as all of this head out and start knocking those doors in this final sprint to the finish, just know that every single one of those contexts could be the difference between re-electing on and bear up or a Republican opponent that would obviously be a shameful loss for all of us. So do that with energy, with enthusiasm, with purpose and when you're done today, do ten more doors. When you feel like you're done, when you feel like you're done, just do ten more. And think about it. If every one of you just has ten more, we're going to win by that much more. So let's do it. Let's get it. Let's get it. Let's get it. How many there? A lot of times you're using a good guy to say it. This is what we live for. And this is how we win races. If you think about how we won in 2012, we have the largest grassroots organization in the United States of America. Well, in 2014, when they threw millions of dollars against us and tried to buy this district, what we did was we put together the biggest GOTV program in those last four days, knocked on more doors, made more front calls, turned out voters, so that the morning after the election, we were down 3,000 votes. And folks were calling saying, you know, I'm sorry, we were pulling for you, President Clinton called. It's like Mr. President, wait a minute. We're going to win this thing because I know how hard folks will work in Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, up until 8 o'clock when the polls close on the next day. We were turning our voters and sure enough, when those ballots got counted, we won by 1,455 votes. Now when Jared says every vote counts, every vote counts in close races like this. Well, let me tell you, I looked at the statistics, GOTV started yesterday. We knocked on more doors, maybe about 20% more doors than we did two years ago. So the program is even bigger this year. And we know this is about getting out there. If our voters vote, we're going to win this race. And this is about what our democracy is all about. If you don't vote, you lose your voice. And what we're fighting for is a fair shot for every American, a fair shot for all of you, the young people in this room. That's why it's so important that you guys are out here because this is about your future. Our obligation or our legacy is not what we're going to do in our lives. Our legacy is going to be about how we make your lives better, how we pay it forward. And at the same time, how we honor the obligations we've made to our parents and grandparents that after a lifetime of work, a lifetime of service, that they can have that dignified retirement with Medicare and Social Security, those are the stakes here. And when we look at the values that are at stake in this election, who we are as Americans, our values are one of the qualities of inclusion. We don't build walls that separate folks. We don't have religious tests that say, well, you're American enough, but you're not American enough. That is not who we are. We're a country in what makes us great as a nation is we're this fabric that's woven together of people of different ethnicities, different backgrounds, different cultures, religions, all woven together in this melting pot that is the United States and it works. And it's worked for 200 years. And that's what we're fighting for. That America that we all believe in. And that's what it's stake. Now this morning, I had the chance to go to the church of unity and read the daily word and deliver some words from the pulpit. And what I talked about is our work isn't over at 8 o'clock Tuesday night. Our work starts Wednesday morning. We start to bring this country together. When we start to address the hate and the things that separate us and we start to come together and start to heal with the violence. That's what the selection is about. That's why what you're doing out there is so critical. And then let's work together. Let's go win this thing. And then 8 o'clock Tuesday night, head up to Carmichael for our election night party and let's celebrate. So on three, let's go win. One, two, three. Let's go win. Let's go win. Let's go win. Let's go win. Let's go win. Let's go win. Let's go win. Let's go win. Let's go win. Anybody who's still here, jump in to work photo and then we'll pick you out of here. We'll go pop. One second. Who? Hold on. Over here. Thank you. Thank you. Over here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks, guys. And if you have a second.",

        "transcript": " Let's do this. This feels like coming home because we moved up here 17 years ago when my wife, Janine, got into UC Davis's med school. She's an Aggie. My office was about 1,000 yards that direction at Tupper Hall. This is home. It feels good back on campus. Now you heard Jose's story. That is the story of the American dream. I believe in this country because I believe in that dream. I'm a product of that dream. My parents came here in the 1950s from India with little more than that dream. You know, they built a life. My mom became a public school teacher. My dad and engineer. I was born and raised in this country. I was born and raised in this state. I went to our public schools, which were the best public schools in the country. I could go to our community colleges and the University of California system for undergrad in med school and get a great education. I paid $393 a quarter to go to med school. Can you believe that? Work part time, get student loans and graduate with less than $10,000 of debt. Now the reason why I say that is I didn't get here by myself. I got here because this country believed in my parents and gave them a chance. I got here because this state and this country made an investment in me. They invested in the next generation. They invested in all of you. And that is what this election is about. That is how we start moving forward by investing in the next generation. But we can't forget the promises that we've made to our parents and grandparents because they built this path for us. And that is the promise to make sure they have the security they need in retirement by protecting Social Security. That is making sure we have the promise of Medicare. So they have the health care that they need when they retire. Now I can't say this better than one of our greatest presidents. He probably put it best and most succinctly. America at its core is an idea. That idea that no matter where you come from or who you are, if you work hard and play by the rules, you'll have the freedom and opportunity to pursue your own dream. And leave your kids a country where they can chase theirs. Anyone want to guess who that president was? Is our 42nd president, William Jefferson Clinton, one of our greatest presidents. Let's think about the legacy of President Clinton. In his administration, he created more American jobs than any other president in history. Over 22 million jobs. Compare that with the Republican Congress that can't pass one job bill that is threatening to take us right back into a recession. President Clinton not only balanced our budget, he left us with a budget surplus. Now compare that with the Republican Congress that is leaving our kids drowning in a mountain of debt. This is a Congress that's taken us into two wars that we didn't pay for. This is a Congress that has given billions of dollars away to Wall Street and health insurance companies. And this is a Congress that wants to raise taxes on middle-class families when they're struggling in order to give tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires. It is exactly the wrong direction that we need to go. We need new leadership. Now I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you who I was running against. My opponent's Dan Lunggren, and he's been responsible for all of that. Some of you guys weren't born in 1978, but Dan Lunggren first went to Congress in 1978. Dan Lunggren was the Tea Party before the Tea Party existed. Let me just tell you a little bit about him. Dan Lunggren has voted repeatedly to take away a woman's right to choose. And he even wants to limit a woman's access to birth control? Wrong. Dan Lunggren has voted to increase interest rates on your student loans, making it harder for you to go to college. And Dan Lunggren has voted repeatedly to take Social Security and Medicare away from our parents and grandparents. He is the wrong prescription for this country. We can't let them take us backwards. We need to move forward. We need leadership that restores the American dream, that Jose benefited from, that I benefited from. We need leadership that is fighting to restore the forgotten middle class, because we all know that America is at its best when our middle class is its strongest. And we need leadership that is willing to fight for our individual liberties and our individual freedoms. And that includes a woman's right to choose. And this is personal. I'm running for Congress because I want my daughter to grow up in a country where she's in charge of her body and she's in charge of her own health care decision. You're welcome. Now this election is a very important election. You've never heard of it. It's the most important election of our lifetimes. But it is. Because it is clearly a path forward. How do we move forward? How do we protect those individual liberties and those rights? How do we rebuild and restore middle class in America? How do we get America working again and start building jobs here in this country? So on November 6, we have to get the President reelected. On November 6, we have to hold on to the Senate. And on November 6, we've got to reelect Congressman John Garimendi and Congressman Jerry McNerney. And we've got to elect future Congressman Jose Hernandez and Ami Barra. Now I have the pleasure of introducing a man that has served our country in Congress since 2007. Congressman Jerry McNerney has been an independent voice in Congress. I look forward to serving with him and fighting for the needs of the residents of the living in the Central Valley. No one in Congress has done a better job in fighting for veterans than Jerry McNerney. And I look forward to serving with him on these issues so that we can serve the men and women of our military with the same respect and devotion that they've served us. It is absolutely. It is my pleasure to introduce Congressman Jerry McNerney.",

        "transcript": " This hearing, it is disturbing to me, you know, kind of this defense of Vladimir Putin and Russia, and it's very worrisome. Look, if we want to call an independent investigation looking beyond 2016, looking into the last administration, great, let's do it. But this is about protecting our democracy. I mean, let's just go through a timeline of, you know, what our current president has said. In October of 2013, he talked about how he does a lot of business with Russia. In November of 2015, he talked about how he got to know Putin very well because we were both on 60 minutes. They were stable mates. December of 2015, you know, Vladimir Putin praises them in response Trump praises him back. February of 2016, he talks about how Putin called him a genius. March 28th, he hires Paul Manafort. You know, August 17th, he gets his president, Trump gets his first intelligence briefing. We're told in that briefing, he's shown direct evidence of Russian government hacking emails. Two days later, Paul Manafort resigns. You know, in July of 2016, he encourages the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's emails. You know, Trump selected President Trump selected November 8th, November 9th, the Russian parliament shares. This is very worrisome. You know, the president talks about this as a political witch hunt. Look, he won the election, but this isn't a political witch hunt. You know, when the tragedy of Benghazi happened, we came together, you know, an independent investigation looked at what happened, what weren't wrong. You know, we lost some heroes that day. They made recommendations. We ought to do the same thing. I think many of us would say the millions of dollars that were spent on Benghazi, the majority, had no issue with doing that. We ought to do the same thing. This is not Democrats or Republicans. This is about protecting the integrity of our elections and pushing back. You know, I would ask the witnesses a couple of yes-no questions. Do you have faith in the intelligence community's assessment that Russian intentionally interfered with our recent elections? Yes, now? Yes, but I'm very troubled to see the commander in chief announcing something that I would have thought was sensitive information. And then reading that people were rolled up in Russia who were probably too close to Putin. So this distresses me. Yes, now, intelligence. Is this citizen? Yes, I have faith in the intelligence community. Ambassador? Yes. And, you know, based on that, do we believe that we ought to consider this interference in our democracy and our elections a national security threat? Ambassador Bloomfield. I use the word challenge. Mr. Dora. Russia's efforts to destabilize the West on all fronts is a threat to us. Ambassador Bear? Yes. Right. And I think we'd all agree that we don't believe Russia or Vladimir Putin has our best interests or democracy's best interests in mind in these attempts. You know, this is about us coming together as Democrats and Republicans and protecting our democracy. If America is not standing up for democracy and pushing back, you know, the rest of the world is watching. It starts to undermine our leadership. Mr. Chairman, you know, what are the reasons why this has been such a great committee is the bipartisan nature of your leadership working with the ranking member? I urge you to let us mark up the Protect Our Democracy Act. Let's have this discussion. Let's set up an independent investigation, look at those independent findings and look at those independent recommendations to protect our elections, to protect the integrity of our elections. Let's not do a political witch hunt. This is about our democracy. Would any of you disagree, you know, let's go to Ambassador Bloomfield, would you support the recommendation of setting up an independent investigation that could come up with findings and make recommendations? I think an investigation is absolutely appropriate, but where you come out, if we are in confusion, if we are in chaos, if we are, if we stop after an investigation and say we're dysfunctional and we can't restore the Western order against the threat, then we have failed. So the idea is to heal the nation, find a way to move forward, see what we can agree on and have our political differences show the world that our democracy not only is democratic but that we can get something done at work. Ambassador Bear, should we do an investigation? Yes, and I said as much in my testimony, but I was written. Great, thanks. I'm out of time. Mr. Ted Yeho, Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chair, thank you for everybody enduring.",

        "transcript": " Thank you. Well this is really overwhelming. Thank you so very much. Who knew that service can really produce an occasion like this? But let me tell you, service is everything. For all of us in this room. And I truly believe this is what makes our country stand out above all others. The fact that we look after each other, the sense that our community is not great unless every single person participates at his own level and potential. I'm so thrilled to be here. I'm so thrilled to be amongst all the advocates and supporters and representatives of the service community. Service has always been something that brought people together, even as a young child. I knew that. Coming to a kindergarten, I realized I didn't have many friends yet because we moved into a new house. So in order to acquaint myself with the other kindergarteners, we decided to have a project. We planted flowers around the schoolhouse, which brought much joy to all of us and brought a sense of community to those little five-year-olds. And in me, instilled forever the sense that you only are able to be a part of a community if you give back. And I'm so thrilled to be here today, in particular, to receive this wonderful award. Senator Kennedy was a true champion for National Service. And I'm deeply honored to receive this award in his name. In 2009, when President Obama signed the Edward M. Kennedy Service America Act into law, he talked about the legislation was about connecting deeds to needs. And as you know, AmeriCorps and Senior Corps members are doing that every single day. They're tutoring and mentoring at RIS students. They're helping local governments to dress climate change. They're providing nutrition and financial literacy education and so much more. Volunteers are answering the most urgent challenges we face as a nation. And that's why elevating the importance of national service has been one of the constants of my career, even before I came to Congress. As many of you know, when I was working in a Clinton White House many years ago, AmeriCorps was created. And his co-chair of the National Service Caucus, which I lead with my colleague, Congressman Price, I'm committed to fighting for the Corporation of a National Service so that it receives the federal support it needs. It needs for amazing volunteers. Because volunteers need the support, we need to support the volunteers so they can go out in a community and spread their wonderful goodness. I've always believed that our shared prosperity as a nation is directly tied to our collective commitment to service. In fact, it was President Teddy Roosevelt who said, this country will not be permanently a good place for any of us to live unless we make it a reasonably good place for all of us to live in. Now, we cannot be satisfied with our own individual gain. We have to look around and see what else we can do. It must continue to be a part of who we are as Americans. And just last month, we celebrated the Martin Luther King Day of Service, Dr. King's words remain enduring. Life's most persistent and urgent question is, what are you doing for others? Are volunteers answering that question and that call to action? And your continued advocacy is essential for them to be able to do so. I want to thank you so very much for being here and for being out in a community, spreading the word about the importance of service for all of us in this country and throughout the world. Thank you so very much for the honor.",

        "transcript": " from California, Ms. Metsu. The lady from California is recognized for this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thank the General Lady from New York for yelling me time, and I yet ask and I must consent revising, stand by. My remarks. Yes, sir. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this close role and the underlying bill. This is a debate about whether we are willing to preserve the fundamental protections our nation has fought for centuries to maintain. It has written the underlying bill rejects these essential protections in favor of vague assurances and provisions open to interpretation. The potential erosion of our legal safeguards is a serious matter. That is why several members of our armed services raise these concerns when they testify to Congress several weeks ago. Mr. Speaker, certain rights are considered so fundamental to our nation and to our Constitution that they cannot be sacrificed. The right of every American to have his or her day in court is one such right. But a number of law experts, including Martin Leederman, who worked in the Department of Justice for both President Clinton and President Bush, believe that this legislation would put that right in jeopardy. As written, this legislation could be used by the President as evidence of congressional agreement of a number of his legal assertions. That includes his assertion that holding American citizen indefinitely without access to a lawyer is legal. From my family's personal experience, I know something about what can happen to the rights of Americans when the executive branch overreaches in a time of war. Restricting the legal rights of our citizens is something which, if done at all, must be done carefully and with a proper balancing of concerns. I know that members of both chambers tried to meet that standard with the administration on this legislation, but this proposal fails to achieve that balance. For that reason alone, we should reject this bill. I'm also concerned because the history of this legislation fits a pattern we've seen before, one of which officials assert expanded powers while ignoring their career professionals in the process. A few weeks ago, Congress heard from a long line of generals and judge advocates general. Their collective testimony outlined a swift, tough approach to these tribunals that protected our troops, and it did so while preserving our moral authority in the world. This bill disregards their testimony and their expertise. They argued forcefully for detainees to see the evidence present against them with some adjustment for classified evidence. They stated that evidence obtained through torture should not be permitted. Not only because it is morally offensive, but also because it is inherently untrustworthy. They clearly reiterated their position that judicial review must be preserved. And above all, they argue strenuously that any legislation must affirm the United States Committee to the Geneva Conventions. They believe this because they know better than anyone that these safeguards protect our troops fighting on battlefields around the globe. Unfortunately, Congress did not listen to these experts in military law. Instead, the bill made an order under this clause rule would permit evidence obtained through torture in some cases. The legislation does include a list of certain gray breaches of the law. Among those, however, it gives the President the authority to determine what is and what isn't torture as long as he publishes it in the Federal Register first. These provisions undermine our nation's moral authority, and once given away, it will be that much harder to earn back. In closing, Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill is vague when it should be specific. It is casual with regard to important legal protections when it should be vigilant, and it is a fundamentally flawed approach to prosecuting terrorists. I urge all members to reject this rule and devote against the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Go, look forward.",

        "transcript": " Thank you very much. Wow, I think they expect everybody to be six, seven, or something like that here. Come on. Honestly, it is so wonderful to be here. And I thought everybody would be jazzed up with the introductions of the presentation early on. And I realized when I was looking at that with all the hooping, that I have a little secret. I'm not going to do anything next year. But I do the hula hoop. I do. My husband kind of chest to that. And I've gotten the weighted hula hoop now. Some kind of an expert on that. Not quite like that. I don't think I could do the Olympic rings. But you know what? Just to jazz it up next year, I may want to bring my hula hoop, too. But anyway, it's wonderful to see all of you here this morning. And I heard a comment outside that maybe you wouldn't have to come to this event. But this is one of the first times you can see each other in person without your masks, as long as you have a drink or you're eating something. But in this wonderful, beautiful, safe, credit union convention center, it is absolutely wonderful. It's just to me, signals and auspicious beginning to what we're going to be doing now. As we come together emerging from the pandemic anxieties of the last two years. First of all, I want to thank Michael Alt and his team and his board. You have held it together. You've done a tremendous job. Perseverance and tenacity through all these challenges. And I also want to have a shout out to our mayor, Mayor Steinberg, who has responsibility for this hub, this downtown, which is really the heart of the city, but also for the rest of the city, too. So thank you, Mayor Steinberg, for everything that you've been doing, too. And we could be honest, the last two years have been tough. We've endured a lot, and no sector of the economy has been untouched. I think back to the earliest days of the pandemic, when we really didn't know what this virus would do. And there was still no vaccine at that time. And my staff and I were on the phone constantly with many of you, the business owners, the community leaders, ordinary people, our neighbors, listening to your concerns and getting your feedback and your personal stories. They were invaluable. Because as we're crafting our federal relief efforts, we needed to understand what was happening on the ground to all of you, to all of us. So we fought to get as many resources as possible to our businesses, many of them small businesses here, downtown restaurants, retail shops, retailers, Osaka, here, downtown, and our region's families. The CARES Act, the 2020, included $89 million for the city. The rescue plan provided over $350 billion across to local governments across the country, which we felt really needed and understood where to put the monies. We received here over $112 million. So that is over $200 million of the last two years. And right now, we all know we're at this inflection point. We can tell it kind of with looking ahead, the broadest smiles we have as we greet each other. And as you will hear from Mayor Steinberg and Michael, we're moving forward on all cylinders, which will be a truly a testament to the resiliency and innovative spirit amongst all of you. We've all worked together to get us to this point. Investments and opportunities are coming from all directions. And at the federal level, I've been fighting really hard to make sure that Sacramento continues to get the resources we need to continue our economic recovery and come back even stronger so we can live our dreams. And as we speak, the bipartisan infrastructure law is delivering federal dollars across the nation. And these historic investments are going to help build Sacramento's future. We've always been an infrastructure town. We know how important it is to ensure that we secure our water resources to make sure we have flood protection, to make sure we think ahead about transportation and our health care. But now we're going to be giving really our new homegrown innovators the tools to continue leading the way in this next stage of our progress, Sacramento. It's never been clear. Sacramento is vibrant. It's an innovative, metropolis with ideas that are ready to go. You know, I think just a couple of weeks ago, I was touring the region, visiting our airport, our wonderful partners at RT and Smud, and our beloved Sacramento Valley Station. And I got the chance to some of the people at the library about broadband access. These are very important infrastructure pieces here. And in each of these stops, I was greeted with the new innovative plans. The optimist that look for the future. Plans are already underway and projects that will really they will absolutely improve the economy and the lives of the community throughout this whole region. The bipartisan infrastructure law truly represents a generational investment that is opening all of these doors. And in Sacramento, our doors are wide open. Because we're prepared. We're prepared to move ahead in a very, very urgent way. But Sacramento is just never wait. We've already seen many projects, managed with the South right before our eyes. Even during this pandemic, we have been working ahead. Look at this convention center complex. We were doing this all the way through the pandemic. And right now, we're currently gathering now is an amazing cutting edge addition to downtown. It's truly the convention and performing arts district. A culturally vibrant corridor where residents and visitors will be able to walk and admire public art and experience our culture of creativity. Just a couple months ago, we opened up the new SMUD Mosaic, a place that will capture the imaginations and inspiration and optimism of our youth in this region. We're continuing to be home to a thriving arts community. And whether it's the world class, exhibits of the crocker, the murals of the wide open walls, or the sounds of the Sacramento Philharmonic, we have captured the power of creative spaces and sounds and music and their ability to enrich our lives. I could go on and on. But that is just scratching the surface of how we're moving the needle in our economic development. Sacramento is one special place. I think you all agree to that. And I'm just talking about all these exciting projects. And how it reminds me why I love representing this community. We work toward common goals. We collaborate. We build community conscious spaces that seek to improve the lives our people, our neighbors. We support our innovators and our businesses because we know that these economic drivers don't just support jobs and community growth today. But they will sustain us for generation. So as we move forward, we have a lot to be proud of and also a lot to look forward to. I'm so excited about the next steps. I know we're getting there. We can see the future now. It might have been cloudy before, but the clouds are drifting away. It's time now. It's time now to really get out there. And we can begin to build and build and soar. So thank you again for all of you here. This morning, this bright morning, to come together. First of all, to welcome each other and be happy that we can be together. But to know that we're going to be worked together and we're going to have a fabulous time starting from now. So thank you very much for letting me speak a little bit. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " The gentleman from New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield three minutes to the general lady from California, Ms. Matsui. The gentleman has to act now for three minutes. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me the time and for an outstanding leadership on our committee. Mr. Speaker, this debate is long overdue. There is no issue more serious or more urgent. The American people said loud and clear in the last election that they consider bringing this war to a close to be a singular imperative of their leaders. Yet rather than beginning to bring the troops home, the president has proposed escalating this conflict. The American people deserve to know or the elected representative stand on this, the most critical issue at this moment in history. This week the people will get their answer. Mr. Speaker, here's where I stand. I oppose this war from the beginning and I support several responsible proposals to bring this war to a close. I believe the president's proposal escalation would be a tragic mistake. It will most likely result in an increase in violence while only postponing the hard political choices the Iraqi people must make. It will also increase the strain on a military that is already stretched to the breaking point. Mr. Speaker, it is critically important to make clear that Iraq has spiraled into civil war because of the failure of this country's political leadership. Not our troops. Our brave men and women in uniform have done everything that has been asked of them. The real tragedy is how ill served they have been by their political leadership. I have heard firsthand from many families in Sacramento the impact this has had on their lives. Linda, a concerned mother, told me that her son Nicholas, who serves as an army sergeant in the 82nd Airborne in Germany, shortly he will be returning to Iraq for his third tour. And there are some 30 soldiers in the Sacramento area who have died in this war. I've met several times with members of the National Guard and reserve and their families. Every member knows what I am talking about. We've all done it. We all know the pain. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, this administration has failed to meet the most basic requirements of responsible leadership. As a result, it has abdicated any claim to deference from this chamber on this war. And has certainly relinquished the moral authority to send additional men and women into this catastrophe. And doubly, this chamber will need to take more forceful action if we are to bring this war to a conclusion. But today is an important first step. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to oppose this gravely mistaken proposal to escalate the war. I yield back the balance of my time.",

        "transcript": " to now live their life in college. We want them to know as well that these programs will be there just as strongly for them in the future. That's why I think we're here, and that's why I'm proud now to recognize the two great champions in the Democratic caucus on this issue. I'll start first with Congresswoman Doris Matsui from the great state of California. Doris. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Javier. And thank you for your leadership in the caucus and also on the ways and means committee. We understand how important this is. We try to celebrate this every year because it is so important. And I'm really happy today that I see some young people amongst this group here, too, because these four programs, ultimately, are for all of us as families. So it is something that we, as Democrats, really do cherish and want to ensure that they're there for the generations as we move forward. I want to thank my co-chair here, Jan Shikowsky, and on senior task force. We've really had a good time together doing this and got to know each other, and got to understand truly what it means to have these programs really insurance in place for all Americans. And we want to make sure that not only do we preserve it, but we make it stronger and sustainable for everyone in the continuing generations. That means not only for our grandparents, our parents, ourselves, our children, our grandchildren, and forevermore into the future. We are celebrating anniversary today because I always believe, and I think you do too, we've got to celebrate and remember and cherish them and understand that we can't take anything for granted. So we have a cake here today, but we'll all share with you later on, but it is a time to celebration and a time to move forward and look ahead to what we must do. The other Americans act so important, as meals on wheels and caregiver support, Medicaid and Medicare, so, so very important for our essential health coverage. And then obviously, so security, our insurance, retirement security, which has become more and more important as we see what's happening to pensions. This is going to be absolutely critical as we move forward. And when you think about the fact that, you know, Jan and I are women too, as you noticed. We are very active with women's caucus also, and we also know that women in particular lose out a great deal because many times they're not paid as much as men, and also because they step out of the workforce being caregivers, and so, their so security is not as robust as it could be. So we hope to be helping in that regard also. We truly believe that these programs, our lifelines and life supports, and life for all of us as Americans, which makes us really unique in this country, is that we look upon each other, and we want to help each other, and it's a compact amongst generations. We cannot lose that. That's what makes us strong for the future. So I would like to just say that the Democrats on the Senior Task Force are ready to serve. We're out there, and we want to help, and we want to be there with you, and we are there with you. We want to include everyone in this process, as we really look forward to what is going to be happening in the coming years. I do appreciate very much being here with my colleagues, and I know, hi, Marcy. Marcy Capters also joined us, and others will be joining us as we continue with this program. But I want to present my really wonderful co-chair, Jan Shikowski. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Steve Lopesack, thank you for being here. Oh, where's Dave? Come on Dave. Come on. Pull up a chair. Come up front. Dave Lopesack from Iowa. I do. Yeah. Come on Dave. Oh. Thank you. So if you look around at these decorations, you'll see that this is reminiscent of the celebrations on Monday of the 4th of July, our day of independence. And we celebrated our nation's 240th birthday. And we, the fundamental idea of independence. And so today, we're really celebrating the idea of senior independence that comes about because of these incredible programs that have been in place for a long time. It's, most of us can't imagine a time before social security when a person could no longer work had to rely on his children. Or in fact, enter a poor house. There were such things. Some of us here, probably most of us, well, no, there's young people too, that don't remember. The days before Medicaid and Medicare, when half Americans had no healthcare coverage, half of older Americans. And when getting sick or injured or needing long-term care, probably meant bankruptcy for many, many people. President Franklin Roosevelt knew that was wrong when he made the passage of social security a priority. And today, it keeps 22 million Americans, including 15 million seniors out of poverty. Welcome to Norma Toys. We're happy to see you from California. Thank you. Thank you. President Roosevelt called Social Security a foundation. And President Johnson and Congress built on that foundation by enacting Medicare and Medicaid and the older Americans Act. And together, these four national treasures allow seniors to retire with a basic degree of dignity and independence. Social securities and Medicare's earned benefits, provide financial and health security. Medicare helps pay for long-term care services and supports. And the older Americans Act provides the assistance many need to stay in one's home and in communities, from meals on wheels to transportation to help with caregiving. So today, we're celebrating because these achievements are helping millions and millions of Americans. And we are not going to let anyone weaken their protections by turning Medicare into a voucher program. Am I right? We're not going to let anybody cut social security benefits, right? Or block grant Medicaid. Not going to happen, right? Or raising the age of eligibility for any of these programs, right? Keep your hands off. Where's your shirt? Hands off. No cut, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. And we're going to add the older Americans Act too. And you can just count on all of us here to be fierce warriors against any of the dangerous proposals that are brought up. And they have been. I saw that Speaker Ryan now has put out a proposal that would raise the age of Medicare to 67. No. So today, we're also celebrating the growing recognition that it is our time to build upon the solid foundation that we've been giving. If FDR could create Social Security during the Great Depression, we can protect and expand its earned benefits today at a time when the United States, not for everybody, but all together, has been, is richer than it ever has been before. Fortunately, most of those increases have gone to people at the top. So we're the richest country at the richest period in our history. And personal wealth in the United States is that a record $88.1 trillion. So we can increase earned benefits and improve the cola at the same time. We can also improve Medicare and Medicaid. How about it? Do you think we can add dental and vision and hearing care to Medicare? Yes. Can we provide more support for home-based care? Yes. Can we lower prescription drug costs? Yes. You bet we can, and we better do it. This is our time to act. It's our job to strengthen and expand seniors' independence. And together, we're going to get that job done for this. And as everyone has mentioned, for future generations as well. Now it is my pleasure to introduce Rich Viesta from the Alliance for Retired Americans. He's Executive Director of the ARA, and a real fighter for the interests of seniors and families. The Alliance has a strong presence here in Washington, DC. But even more important, it has members and state organizations around the country, including in my home state of Illinois. In fact, I used to be the Executive Director of the organization that is now called the Alliance for Retired Americans. It was the Illinois State Council of Senior Citizens. That's where I got my start. And under Rich's leadership, we have activists that are building strong campaigns and coalitions to strengthen and expand programs that work for seniors. So welcome, Rich. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I'll grab it. Yes. When the music stops, grab a chair, isn't it? The old game. Thank you, Congresswoman Shikowski, other members. And indeed, we do have strong chapters. In fact, in all of the states of the members who were here today and our Virginia president, Mr. Scott, is here. Ron Thompson, who drove all the way from Ivoire, Virginia, which is down there in the southeast part of the state. Right, right, right. It's not next door anymore. We drove the land. We get you some more friends and help here. Well, this is a great month for senior independence, because it was 50 years ago, 51 years ago now, that all of these acts were signed. When Congress could actually pull up its sleeves, pull out the pens, compromise, and get some good bills, 51 years. A year ago, we were in this exact same room to celebrate the Medicare signing, the 50th anniversary when President Johnson signed it at the Truman Library. But just last week on July 1, 2016, was the 50th anniversary of when Medicare was implemented, when seniors could get health care. When health care was available without regard to their previous existing condition or their race or whatever they may need. So we are in our 50 years and five days now of seniors having Medicare and having a Medicare card in their wallet. And it'll soon be 81 years that social security, again, providing that independence from poverty, the independence on relying on friends or the rest of your family. And I know it's been very important to all of our members. And even to members of Congress, Mr. Lobsack has talked in the past about how important social security was to his family, growing up, for example. So I'd like to introduce one of our members from right here in Washington, D.C. Diane Fleming, who can tell us about the importance that these programs have made to her life and in her retirement. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Rich, and our Honourable Diet here. It's just wonderful to everyone, all young, and it's just a great thing to see so many of our young people that will carry this on. I'm Diane Fleming, and I am from the Anacostia neighborhood, which literally is about five minutes away across the bridge. I'm a retired member of the International Association of Machines, and I'm here today on behalf of the Alliance for Retired Americans. Today we're celebrating social security and Medicare, two of the most successful programs. And we've gotten statistics on how many and how many people benefit from these programs. We were surrounded by others who are also fighting to expand, protect, and preserve social security and Medicare. Thank you all so much. It is appropriate that this event is around 4th of July, our Independence Day, and the celebration of birthdays of the programs. As an adult, I worked for United Airlines for 39 years. The company, well, the company quit paying into our pension. So as a result, my pension was lost. So I had to go with the government guaranteed pension to get my somewhat of a payment. I had to take social security at 62 in order to supplement my income. Millions of Americans and future retirees, the current benefits, they don't, there's no guaranteed pension fan a plan anymore. So you really have to be careful with how you invest and what you do. Wages and having kept up with the cost of living. So that's why many of us, I have to take a part-time job to help supplement. In the meantime, I'm still paying into social security. They take out money, you know, as you still work. I thought that was going to end. I called and said, well, I'm on social security. Do I still have to pay? They said, yes, you have to keep the bank going. So that's what that's about. But we've paid into this benefit. And it, oh, I'm sorry. OK. All right. All right. The time. Medicare is also so, so important. I just read, had a reoccurring bout with thyroid cancer. So I had to go and have mini test and mini scans done. And they are so, so expensive. So I would not have been able to do this without Medicare because I would either have lost my place to live, become homeless. Or you have another choice is not to be able to get these things, which, you know, you can then not live in equality of life. My story actually started, I'm getting a little bit off track, at the age of three. My father died when I was three. My sister had just been born. So as a result, my mother was able to receive so security benefits to sustain us until we reached age of 18. So that's one of the things that many Americans, many families that have lost loved ones and able to keep their family going. They receive so security benefits. So it's not just for us old people. It benefits many, many people in our country. If speaker Ryan's proposal were to become a law, seniors would be deeply hurt. And we seniors know that. We cannot afford to wait until we're 67 to go on Medicare. And private citation is another word for benefit cuts. The Affordable Health Care Act, we feel confident about the future of the Medicare's, as it turns 51 and 2016. We intend to make sure it's still strong, thanks to all of our health here. And all of our help, we have to get out and make sure that we vote the right way, not just for the top office, but those other offices like here. Those are the most important things. Because there are three forms of government, which one of the candidates doesn't realize. So anyway, we have to make sure that we select the right people for our benefits. And one of the young men I was talking to, and we said, you know, the why. So the why is that we want to make the quality of life better for everyone. And it's about caring and love for our fellow Americans. And it's, you know, the why is very simple. So if we did that, we would not have to go through all these exercises. So thank you very much. I really want to thank you, Diane. I'm glad you pointed out the family aspect of social security. I have two grandchildren who received social security checks because their their mother died. And it's a really big help to my son and as a single parent raising the family. So it's an insurance policy really for all Americans. Now it is my pleasure to introduce a friend and the president and CEO of the National Committee to serve social security and Medicare, Max Richmond. And Max is a consistent and persistent champion of seniors and the need to protect and expand social security and Medicare to ensure that all seniors are able to live with independence and dignity. He travels the country to get out the facts and the priorities that are important to seniors and their families. Let's give it up for Max Richmond. And let me just acknowledge that we've been joined by Louis Franco from California and Lucille Florida and Lucille Roybal, where are you from California. Sorry. Franco is Florida. Good afternoon, everybody. Let me thank Congresswoman Chikowski and Congresswoman Matsui for inviting me and our we call them cats, C-A-T-S. Thank you for being here. My job is to introduce John Glazer and he's going to make a statement in a few minutes. But before I do that, I just wanted to mention that some of this has been referred to. There are two questions that I hear more often than anything else at town hall meetings around the country and persistent. Some people call me obnoxious, but persistent is okay. But the two questions are, why is Washington taking away our cola? That's the way people see it. Why is Washington taking away our cola? No cola in 2010, no cola in 2011, no cola this year, and based on what the trustees told us a few weeks ago, there may be no cola next year in 2017. It is unimaginable to believe that seniors have not had inflation affecting them in all these years. That does not make sense. And the other thing I hear so often is why are so many politicians calling Social Security an entitlement? As Congressman Bissarim mentioned, it's an earned benefit. It's paid for during a lifetime of work with a fight attacks on wages. So I just mentioned these because I think Congress needs to respond. And I've done town hall meetings with many of the members here, or Telletown Hall meetings with Congressman Frankel and Congressman Bissarim. I did one with you a number of years ago where we had an interpreter who translated everything I said into Spanish. It took him about ten times as long to say it in Spanish. I think he was giving his own speech. But it's been an honor for me to work with all of the members of Congress here over the years. John Glazer recently retired. He worked at the Committee to preserve Social Security and we missed you, John. But he came to us from a long career as an organizer working with low income communities across the United States and across the world. And he has had a firsthand experience in over 20 countries with the importance of social insurance, with the social safety net, and the kind of medical services that are required for a decent quality of life. So John was with us for 16 years as a grassroots manager at the National Committee. He's retired. But we didn't want him to get off that easy. So he asked him to come back and speak this afternoon, John. Well, thank you, Max. And thank you, Representative Shankowski Matsui and the Sarah. And from fighting media, thank you very much for inviting me to speak today about Social Security and what it means to the independence of seniors, which to me is very important because I spent so much of part of my life working with seniors. And part of my life as a social worker and a community activist and an aging advocate and now as a beneficiary, I've seen really, basically, firsthand, not only here in the U.S., but other countries, countries that I have lived in for a period of time, Haiti and Poland. And I've seen how important a social safety net is to people, to people with retirees, have this country be with disabilities and spouses and their children. It's really something that other countries that we take for granted here. Other countries just don't have that. So without Social Security, over half, as you know, older Americans would fall into poverty. While essential to so many Social Security benefits are basically modest. The average monthly benefit is only $1344, which means that a lot of people fall under that amount, which to me seems pretty inconceivable because I don't know how people can live much less than that. Unfortunately, an independent and dignified retirement as Max has said is being threatened. Stagnet wages are grinding away at the middle class's ability to save for retirement, to save anything for retirement. And only 20% of the workforce have traditional pensions. And that's something that we've seen drop off and people connected with labor and all that very well. That was a traditional pensions, was a staple for retirement, retirement security, very, very important for decent standard living. That's why millions of Americans reach retirement age without enough private savings at all to live on. That's why 40%, that's why 40% of Social Security beneficiaries depend on the program for 90% of their income. And when you think about that, 40% of people, that's a very large amount of people that spend almost all their money before they get any kind of help. And that's very difficult because it's 90% of the people in the country had, they rely on that amount of money for to live on. And that's almost impossible. Here's our also suffering from a zero coal as we've mentioned before. And according to the latest Social Security Trustees report, next year's coal is estimated to be, so I told them, another source point, two tenths of 1%, two tenths of 1%, which is incredible. Now, what does it mean for us to face years of no or low coal? It means a widow cutting her pills in half to make her prescription last longer. It means an elderly couple giving up a meal once a week. It means a grandmother giving $10 instead of $20 to her granddaughter for her birthday. The combination of the retirement crisis and no cola means that many seniors are living increasingly difficult lives. Lives they did not wish for and lives we should not wish on them. So creating a decent cost of living adjustment by fully developing the consumer price index for elderly is just one common sense benefit improvement. There would ease the economic burden facing millions of our seniors. And the occasion of Social Security's anniversaries that we celebrate today, Congress should make this another benefit expansion, a priority to ensure that current and future retirees are able to celebrate their independence through a better quality of life for everyone. Thank you. Well, we've been joined. We've blessed with all these wonderful members that have come. I'm going to just call people on the order that they came. I hope I got that right. And anybody who wants to come up, I know that Eddie Bernouce Johnson is planning a summit on Social Security. Why don't you, if you want to stay where you're at, you can put on the mic right there. Well, thank you very much. I did mention that I'm planning a summit on Social Security, which won't be my first one, but it'll probably be my largest one because there are more concerns than I've ever heard before about Social Security and coal and so on. I want to share a story of why I chose the party that I'm in. Years ago when I was a little girl, before domestic workers were covered by Social Security, my grandmother came home one day and said that her friend, who lived about five doors from us and owned her own home, was having to give up her home and moved to Austin. I'm from Texas because they had an old folks home because she had stopped working and had no other income. I really didn't know what that meant until after I had finished college and gotten married and still not old enough to vote because she had to be 21 then. I was talking to my mother-in-law about trying to decide whether I was going to vote for Kennedy or Nixon. And that seems crazy today, but just out of college, I have returned to Texas from Indiana and had been in contact with a lot of Republicans. I could not make up my mind. And my mother-in-law said, well, just think of this. Social Security was started back in 1935. My role's a belt. Then he was followed by a Truman who wanted Medicare and Medicaid. And he worked really hard. But when LBJ got elected as president and he took in a big majority of Democrats, it was passed. And that is why LBJ went to Truman to get the bill signed. And that same lady I've heard you talk about would not have to leave her home because she would have Social Security come again. And I started researching and found that Social Security had done more for minority women of Texas than any other place because they finally had a way to have income after they retired. And that also determined that I was going to be a Democrat. You just can't read that history and live as a person who's experienced a lot of things, especially with neighbors. I was fortunate to have a two-parent home and educated parents, but it was not really that usual during the time. And so now there's no question about where I stand with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid because it has lifted so many people. And just today as I left the floor to come here, I was, did a statement on a bill that I was corresponding, that I introduced my version of it 10 years ago, trying to get Medicaid to cover mental health care. We finally got a skeleton of a bill out today because most of us live every day seeing people that have some type of mental illness but no way to get care for because the facility is not available and the money certainly is not available. So we're putting in jail's and prisons. And somehow we're going to get there when we pass a skeleton of a bill to get Medicaid to have cover some of mental health care. So it's about that we continue to fight, but we must fight it. Thank you. Thank you, Eddie Grunese. Marcy Captor, great state of Ohio. Want to come up? Thank you, Dean. Thank you, Jan and Doris, for pulling us all together and all of our members who are here. And each reflecting on personal experiences that they and their families have had related to social security and then Medicare without question in the last century, those programs were transformational for every person in this room, every family that's represented certainly my own family that came to our country 100 years ago. And a book's been written by Alexander Allred called White Trash. It's just come out. And I guess I fit in the White Trash part of America. And when you really read the history of the struggle of working people who are, who hang in the balance in this election, I think that social security and Medicare become very, very important poignant issues for us to recall how a foundation stone was placed under every family in this country. And which party did it? And what's at stake for us? We live at a time when a lot of the jobs that had provided a middle class way of life have been moved elsewhere, certainly in the part of the country that I come from, Northern Ohio. It's actually staggering to see what has happened. We've seen benefit cuts. We've seen retirement programs that we thought were guaranteed, just pulled out from under people. So social security and Medicare and Medicaid are lifelines to every American family. And I can guarantee you when our parents passed, I went into putting away their items after their deaths. And our mother's billfold had two things. One was her library card and the other one was her social security card. And it just reminds me how important it is to every person in this room, every family in this room. And it is a net built under, almost like a trampoline net, built under the families of our country. I'll just end with one of our members on the other side of the aisle this morning, paid tribute to his grandmother, who just turned 105 years old. And as I listened to him talk, I thought social security and Medicare are working. They're working the way they were designed. We wish the same for everyone. Thank you so much for doing this, Janet and George. Glad to be here today. I just wanted to note that Marcy Capter, younger she looked, is the longest serving woman in this house of representatives. We're so proud of her. I wanted to give the mic to Dave Lobsack from Iowa. Thanks, Jan. She almost said Ohio, didn't she? How that goes? Could have been Idaho. Anyway, just very briefly. And Jan was with me a year ago when I had an event in Iowa. I talk about my story a lot. My story was already mentioned, thank you. But I have to repeat it. I always say that social security Medicare are the two greatest anti-poverty programs we've ever had in the history of this country. We can never, ever forget that, folks. I grew up, I had a mom who had an 11th grade education and struggled with mental illness, and she was a single parent. And on the 4th grade, we landed on the front steps of my maternal grandmother's house. Two bedroom house, one bathroom, all that. We had four kids, we were cramped the whole time growing up, as you might imagine. But my grandma was on social security at that time. My mom was on what was then a FDC from time to time, food stamps, and they really were stamps. We remember going to the grocery store and giving those stamps and seeing how some people would look at us. It's a little easier with an EBT card now, but it's still not easy. But when I was a senior in high school, it didn't matter that I didn't know my dad very well, he died. And I was able to get to Iowa State University at that time, since then those benefits have been reduced dramatically. But I was able to go to Iowa State University because I got a monthly check from social security because my dad had died and he had paid enough in. I wouldn't be here today myself two years from Medicare, by the way. I wouldn't be here myself today if it weren't for all of these tremendous programs that we're talking about. Quite literally I wouldn't be here, folks. I have an obligation to protect these programs as a congressman. I have an obligation to make sure that they survive for succeeding generations. And one last point, I'm glad that Jan talked about other programs too. It's rumored to brag a bit. If you go online and you look at the Meals on Wheels cookbook on page 64, you will see my recipe for sloppy Joes because I'm a huge fan of Meals on Wheels. Thank you for putting this together, Jan and Doris. Thanks everybody for being here. We're going to protect these programs. Thank you. Okay Dave, what page was that? 64. 64, sloppy Joes. Okay, thank you for that. And from the great state of Florida, our great number lowest, Frankl. Thank you, Jan. Thank you. We go. Thanks. Thank you. As long as Lotus for keeping these issues alive, you know you, when I'm hearing that much in the campaigns, but I could tell you in Florida. Florida. Florida, Florida. This is always the number one issue for me. We've heard a lot about how爆out social security and Medicare keeps are elders out of poverty, but the fact of the matter is it keeps a lot of people out of poverty. And I just, I'm going to use my state as an example. state as an example, which is the economic power of seniors. And we have a population of 19 million people in Florida approaching nearly people over 60 make up almost 23% of the population. And we're still growing there. Watch out Texas. We're coming for you. But listen to this, the spending power of Florida's elders is $135 billion annually, almost $15 billion more than residents age 49 and under. And seniors account for 50% of all new home construction. Florida seniors contribute $3.5 billion to charities and pay $1 billion in local school taxes. I could go on and on. The fact of the matter is that seniors are more than carrying their weight. Not only in Florida, but all over the country. And just think what a loss in such a career would mean not only to our older citizens who deserve who have earned this, but to everybody else. So with that, I say thank you all for being here to the retirees and the when they retirees and I yield back. Thank you, Lord. That's really true. We keep the economy not only of Florida, but much of our country going as seniors. And now from another great Californian, Normatories. Good afternoon. Thank you so much, Jan and Doris for bringing us together. It's always a good day for birthday cake. There are two things that while I am in Congress, I will continue to work to bring about a fix. One of them is the issue with the COLA. Let me tell you how I learned about this issue. As a member of the State Assembly, I served with my colleagues here from California. I started to find out about seniors living together. And I thought, what a wonderful thing, you know, finding love in your senior years. And as I began to tour senior apartments, senior buildings, I learned more and more that people were not in love necessarily living together. People were making ends meet, you know, by bringing their budgets together, by scraping, you know, dollars for dollars. And this was not their choice. This is what they had to do in order for them to not become homeless. That is not the American dream. I mean, that is not why, you know, you work so hard in your younger years and pay into this account. The other issue that is very close to me is the issue of folks like myself. I started working with a special work permit in California. I can't work under the age of 16. But as a 15 year old, I started working at my high school. And I've been working. I paid for 12 years into Social Security with a private job. And then I got a city job working as a 911 dispatcher and paid into that pension. But because of that pension that I have for 17 years that I worked at LAPD, I will not be able to collect on social security. And though now in my position as a member of Congress, I'm paying back into that account. And that's the same story for teachers. You know, they have a pension, but although they might have, like myself, have had another job in the private industry, it might have left, you know, their teaching position for a while. For a while in California, we pink slip our teachers because we had a $30 billion deficit. And now that they're back working, they will not be able to draw social security that they paid into. And that is just not right. Because our teachers are some of the poorest elder Americans because they are retiring with $20 or $30,000 pension, not enough, not enough to pay, you know, for housing and for all of the things that they need in their senior years. So those are the two issues that I am committed to work on while I am here in Congress. Thank you so much for the opportunity to address you today. And someone who's been a really great member of our senior citizens task force again from California, Lucille Wuyble-Eller. Well, let me start with saying why, and at what age social security became important to me and where I gained my first understanding of it. I was just a little girl. And my father was a public health worker. And they went into the Los Angeles City Council and then became a member of Congress. But back when I was very young, I overheard a conversation between him and my mother talking about social security and asked him what that was and why was it important. And the way he explained it to me, not only in terms of the benefits, but he gave me a picture of what it was like before social security. My father would be over 100 years old right now. And he told me about the seniors that were homeless living on the street. The seniors that were dying because they couldn't afford not only medication, they couldn't even afford food or heat. And that it wasn't until social security was passed that that started to change. So that was my first introduction to social security. And one of the reasons that I am such a strong and avid supporter of it. And I want to compliment my colleagues, Doris, that Sui and Jan Jekowski, for keeping this issue in the forefront. But I particularly want to say thank you to all of you. No matter how hard we work in Congress to try and protect social security, to fight for the coal as in all the things that you know are important. We cannot succeed without your help and your support and your stories of what it means to you in your everyday life. So I want to thank you for being here, for your advocacy and for partnering with my fabulous colleagues who are here and they are fabulous. You have no idea how hard they work on your behalf to protect social security. But as I said, we cannot do it. We cannot win this without you and your support. And so thank you for being here. Thank you for your advocacy. And I am convinced that because of you, we will be successful. Thank you. So that was rang. But I do mark to Sui and Role Ruiz, Dr. Role Ruiz from California, both of you. Come up. Say a few words. I'm still hope is the leader still planning to come. I don't know. We're hoping for Nancy Pelosi to come. But in any case, then we're going to quickly cut the cake. Go ahead. Thank you. I want to thank Jan and Doris for organizing this event and all of you who participated. I'm Dr. Role Ruiz. I'm an emergency medicine physician from the desert down in Southern California in the Coachella Valley, very high senior population. But one thing that really strikes us in the desert is that you have seniors who can afford their third home in Palm Springs. And then you have the rest of seniors who are barely making ends meet on social security, living in a trailer. I have taken care of many, many seniors in the emergency department. I can tell you firsthand that if it wasn't for Medicare, their life expectancy and their recovery from whatever illness would be completely diminished. And I can tell you through my own family experience and also visiting seniors in trailer parks and whatnot as a physician and as a person doing community volunteer service that if it wasn't for their social security, they wouldn't need, they would be homeless and they wouldn't have any means of transportation to be independent. So the whole purpose of Medicare and Social Security is to have health security and to live a life with independence and to make sure that you have a quality of life.",

        "transcript": " We'd like to welcome Congressman, Congressman Woman, excuse me, Doris Matsui, a member of the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee. She is a leader on the Bipartisan Connect for Health Act, which addresses a number of telehealth policies. Congresswoman, thank you for joining us, Bob. Thanks, Katie. Thanks, Congressman, for joining us this morning. Thank you. You've introduced bipartisan legislation on healthcare, which is hard to do. Well. And it's with Bill Johnson of Ohio. Can you tell us a little bit about what that legislation would do and where it is in the Congress right now? OK. Bill Johnson, I have been doing a lot of things together. And actually, in technology, we seem to be able to work together really well with the other side on telehealth of Bill Johnson. And also, we're at the Dothry when I work with Spectrum. But what we're trying to do, Bill Nye, is essentially to actually move forward with ensuring that we can have more access to telehealth. And the way we're doing it is that we already passed Medicare Advantage as far as being able to use telehealth there. What we're trying to do is really kind of attack the big one in which is Medicare fee for service, which is difficult because CMS, HHS believes that, or CBO, believes that it's going to be cost more, essentially. It used more services. But in fact, what we like to do is give the Secretary sort of to waive certain restrictions so that he can decide what type of services can be paid for fee for service, reimbursement, rather. And then let them decide and let the actual decide at that point. So we feel, in essence, because that is really the big one to attack. And if we do that and move that forward, it really breaks open a lot of reimbursement issues. What do you see in your district? What are you hearing from your constituents? And we talk about acronyms of CBO and HHS. And what do you see at the ground level of telehealth and telemedicine that's actually helping patients where technology is an asset? Well, you know, nowadays, technology's all around us. I mean, our personal lives, we use it all the time. And so I believe that, in essence, people want to see this more in health care and make it more efficient. And certainly, that's one of the aspects of lowering the cost, too. And I believe it can be safe and secure and cost-saving, too. If, in fact, we allow patients to monitor themselves, in essence, especially chronic diseases like diabetes. And also, when you think about the fact that there are deficiencies in really reaching out to specialists or primary care doctors, and their barriers of geography and also transportation. So why not allow individuals to really do maybe video conferences, be able to do things electronically, so that the patients themselves feel like they have the opportunity to access health care efficiently. And during the time that they can actually do it, too, a lot of people cannot have in-person care. I mean, that's just the way it is, particularly rural areas, even urban areas where particular older folks can't get around as much. So I think from Medicare in particular. And also, we're looking at it in behavior health. I think that is so important, because there are some behavior health provider shortages. And in this way, a person can contact their psychologists and be able to have a conversation or be able to be assisted in a way that is timely. And with particular behavior in mental health, sometimes you need that right away. And it's difficult to get to your health care provider, your mental health provider. And in this way, you can assist a person with their health care, mental health care, in a timely manner. What is the effect of access to broadband? I mean, everybody come in Washington and New York and the Northeast thinks, well, everyone has access to the internet, but it's really not the case. How big a problem is that? I think it's a big problem. It really is, because we can't have even an urban area. I mean, most people think an urban area has broadband. Not all the time is that true, because they're underserved areas in the urban areas. But particularly rural areas, it's difficult to have broadband out there. Careers don't want to be there. It doesn't costly. So that's where we have to incentivize the carriers to be out there, in essence. And so that's where we look at wireless and things like that. And so the rural areas are really areas where we really believe broadband is going to be necessary for them to not only have the health care that need and deserve, but for economic development also. You remember the energy and commerce telehealth working group? Yes. What are the priorities of that group and how often do you meet, et cetera, et cetera? It's a group that was put together by Chairman of the Washington, when he was chairman. And it's a group of us who really look at these issues of health and technology and try to move bills forward. And we've been very successful to do that, and opening up the discussion, in many cases, too. Because there are privacy aspects here that people are concerned about. And we do have to deal with that with cybersecurity, because we have to look at what we do as far as making sure the platform in health care works for this, and especially when we're talking about electronic health records, which are necessary. And that's one of the things we're incentivizing, too, to a great degree. We have a piece of it in the opioids bill, which should be coming up this week, in which we're incentivizing behavior health providers to use and adopt by using some of the center payments, just as we did with hospitals and doctors, and left them out as far as behavior health. This was some time ago, though, with the high-tech act. So it's really concerning to all of us, particularly now, that we have really addressed more thoroughly, and hopefully more carefully, mental health care. It's being on parity with physical health. In 2017, according to a recent study, 71% of health care providers use some type of telemedicine pool, which is pretty good. But how can that number get higher? I need to get higher. I think the problem is a lot of, there are problems, I think, in communicating, too. We have different systems. And they're working through that. But also, I think people are sort of concerned about privacy aspects. And I think that has to be resolved. We like to see something take place in HHS, and have definitely some security aspect. And have a regulation? No, I think really having, I used to, I had to build this, I'm going to do this again, where we really have somebody at the level of the Assistant Secretary being in charge of this. Because I believe that there are certain areas that people feel like they're siloed. And I really feel that we need to have an expert there who understands what is going on to assist the health care providers. How can CMS and stakeholders help the situation and provide more access and work together in a way? Well, CMS has to be much more flexible. And I think they have been put to a certain degree, too. And that's why we want to really incentivize, have them incentivize, for instance, the behavioral health providers, to really use and adopt a lot of the electronic health records, which they aren't right now. So we like them to do that and to really open it up so that it'd be easier to do it. Now, you can do this at a level where you can have demonstration projects. And I think those kinds of things are really efficient and they really do prove something. And both Democrats and Republicans like that. Because you're looking at it to see if it proves that. And then you can expand it. Is there a lot of news this week? But actually, the government is not going to have a shutdown by partisan bill, a funding bill that passed. And there's actually been a lot of bipartisanship on appropriations this year. On the Energy and Commerce Committee, what's the level of bipartisanship? Well, I think recently, particularly in opioids, because that affects every district in this country. There's been a lot of bipartisanship. I believe where we were able to focus on the opioid crisis. What some of us would like to do is expand it even further, particularly because a lot of the payment for opioids, at least in the sense of behavior health, is to mitigate. And we need to look at Medicaid and know that that is a vehicle which a lot of these things are paid for. And so even though we are an agreement with the fact that we have to address opioid crisis and we're doing things, it's still at the edges yet. We need to look at the whole situation and move forward. But it is good that we're addressing it. And as I said, technology, the technology subcommittee, we really do work very well together. It could just more regional differences than partisan differences. And many times I represent urban suburban area. So I work with my rural area colleagues because I've got the population. And they have got all this surface area and land. And I like the system because I've got underserved areas. They have underserved areas. And many times we can help each other when we work through some of these things. Because if we can get help for each, then we're both winning. And a few minutes we'll open up to questions. So think of your questions. One of the big questions heading into the crucial stretch here about 40 days away in midterms is the house going to flip to the government director. To your party, do you think the house is going to flip this fall? Well, I'm not going to be a prognosticator. I would just say that I'm quietly confident. But listen, it's a long time. 40 days is a long time in politics. And so we're just going to work every single day. Each of us. And I'll leave it there. Health care, though, Democrats have been talking a lot this election year about health care. Two part question. Number one, is it the biggest issue that you hear in your district? And number two, should Democrats win? Would that be a number one, number two, number three, top three priorities? All of us are hearing about health care in different ways. Where there was about pre-existing conditions, it's about premiums. It's about the fact that they finally feel like they have some health care. And they don't want to lose it. And so it's a big issue. That and jobs, which we're addressing also. But yes, health care is something that we start out with if we're over-care act. And I was on the committee at the time when we wrote that. And we knew that there were first-get access, and we had to lower the costs. And we couldn't get all of that ton. So therefore, we're looking at the access part. I think we need to stabilize a marketplace. We knew how to do that. And we'll move forward on that if we take the house back, obviously. But the thing is, is that I believe the Republicans also understand, too, that health care is still very important. So we have to move forward on that and addressing the costs of health care. And I think all of us understand is too costly. So we are moving in a way of value over quantity, particularly in areas in that Medicare. And so people understand that it's much easier and better to look at the whole continuum care. And we started moving in that direction with kind of a care of conversations and medical homes. And looking forward to, as we address, all of the ultimate aspects of the costs over time and using technology, which we haven't used as well as we probably could, to use that to address some of the costs also, and the convenience. And also, I think we get better health care that way, too. A little bit up for questions in the last few minutes of this segment. So if you have a question, please raise your hand. And identify yourself. And just wait for the microphone to get to you. Hi, Congresswoman. Hope all is well. Good morning. My name is Calvin Robinson from Williams and Jensen. My question for you is, do you guys have any views on removing the restrictions of 1834M? Which one is that one? That one is for telehealth regulations, basically focusing on different things from originating sites, health plans, where we're doing this. Oh, yes, right. We're addressing that. Particularly a piece of it has been addressed in the opioids bill, as it is part of the opioids bill, as we move forward. And it really is right now, just for the opioids, we'd like to expand it out further. And that's part of what we intend to do. This is part of having some of this lifted by the Secretary of HHS, and the wave some of these conditions. And so we believe in making progress in that area, and the originating sites, and things like that at the first step. Other questions? How has it been working with the Trump administration on health care? Well, I haven't necessarily been working with the Trump administration on health care. I have been working with my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee. And it's been an interesting, because there's been a lot previously, all that repealing replace, that never happened really. They did the repeal, but they never did replace, and that didn't pass anyway. So I think it's been quieter. So we have been focusing on the aspects that we can work together. And I mean, that's really very important. And understanding that there are aspects of it, where, in fact, I mentioned Medicare and Medicaid. And when the opioid crisis came about, which is interesting, because we, in my district, were the crisis maybe a couple of years ago, addressing it. But it didn't come that way in the rest of the country. So it's particularly on Northeast and the East. It started really taking hold. So when your district didn't really hit the South, the South, the South, the South. It did hit, but it hit earlier. OK. And a lot of us coming down from trying to Mexico, but we were addressing as quickly as we could. Not that we don't have a crisis, or it's all gone. It's never gone. I mean, I think those are the kinds of things. We really have to continue the address. I mean, we know with health care, nothing's ever completely done. And one of the things is that you never know what's going to come up next, whether it's that, Ebola, whatever. So therefore, I think, particularly in energy and commerce, we get involved in many, many things. And the aspects of what we're doing are really relevant to what's happening today, whatever it is. And because of that, we seem to be able. We had some problems with health. But because everybody had the same situation, we're able to work together. And also, make some reforms to start to make some reforms, in particular areas like Medicaid and Medicare, as you brought up. And hopefully, we can use that to move forward. Because there's somewhat like to certain degrees on the demonstration projects on their own. Yeah. You mentioned affordability in working with Republicans and Republicans see that there are problems as the Senator and Congresswoman Carter mentioned in our last panel. Do you think, whatever happens in the election, that there could be, let's say, outside of opioids, let's say outside of Obamacare, because that's going to be difficult, that there could be some work on prescription drug prices. Oh, yeah. Anything like that? You think there could be bipartisanship on that? I hope so, because that's what comes up in off a lot, the cost of prescription drugs. And that's where a lot of costs are really, particularly, a problem. And so we're looking at prescription drug costs, particularly in Medicare. And we like to see Medicare use its leverage. Since it's got 40 million people in beneficiaries. And they all use medications. So if we can use that as a bargaining power, I think it'd be great, because I think everybody knows if Medicare moves, the rest of it moves, too. So that's an issue that President Trump has mentioned, at least on the campaign trail. But critics say he hasn't done much. Well, I haven't seen too much in that. So we're really looking at it and trying to figure out. A lot of it is layered, too. You can't tell sometimes when one adjusts one way, like go down one way, and then they pick up, it's costly, another place. So it's a complicated issue, but it's one of the top issues for all of us. What about single payer? Would that be a top priority for House Democratic control, Chamber? I think that's more through some of the states. I mean, the way I look at it, I believe in universal health care. So how we get there is going to be maybe, we'll look at it with it. We only have buy into Medicare, Medicare for all. We're not there yet. I'm just trying to recall, even though we're talking, we're not talking about a quarter of a carer. At the very beginning, we had a public option. So we understand what steps we might want to take in order to get to universal care. It is something that we're talking about, but we're not taking the action right now. Just on the overall issue of funding, is that something that health care needs more funding? And would it be taxes? I mean, some people say the tax cuts need to be repealed. Some Democrats are saying that. Well, I think if you look at the whole system, there are places that we can reduce costs. And I think we have to look at that. I think we need to look at the marketplace and make some adjustments there. And I also believe that we need to ensure that Medicare and Medicaid are stable. I think that's really very important, because that provides so much of the health care of our nation. But I'm not going to say right away, we have to add money to the system. I mean, I think we need to balance this thing out, because there are things in the system right now, like we're talking about prescription drugs, that we need to squeeze some efficiencies out of right now. Well, thank you for joining us this morning. Thank the Congresswoman. I hand it back to Katie. Thank you so much.",

        "transcript": " Oh Oh quite o I'm a Knight. I stood in front of my supporters and talked about the opportunity for me to win my race. 11 years ago, after being in Conor's Rally in short run, I had a handsome young man. He come to my office in the middle of the turf. He was at the University of Maryland and soccer players. He was working two jobs because we draw him. His high office loved him. Mr. Jones came in and he gave tours to love him. At the time, he told me that he really had found his time. He wanted to be in public service and he wanted to work for the people of California. He went on to law school, he went home to California. Ran in Dublin to become a member of the town council. Went to the Alameda County Crossfit Youth Office and decided to run for Conor's. We are at the crossbow of the star. We're waiting for a lot of returns to come in, but I will tell you right now, I feel like I did 16 years ago. I feel like I did 16 years ago. But the people of California are waiting for me to go out and get their car. And when I look at this young man now, living years later, I think tonight's bell. Aren't we lucky that people still want to be in public service? Yeah. There's nothing like working for the people in California, there's nothing like working for the people in the East Bay, and many of my former constituents are now in California 15, and they are going to have a phenomenal representative when the vote is finally finally counted. I want to introduce you to the member of the, first and I think we'll be the member of Congress, when the 90s over. And that is the person you've worked for, the person that you have put into Congress, Eric Swallow. Thank you. Thank you, Ellen. It was 11 years ago where I worked as an intern and had the honor and pleasure of serving in Washington DC for you, and Congresswoman Towscher took a chance on me when I had just lost a soccer scholarship, and my folks told me, son, they're going to go to Washington DC as an unpaid intern. You're going to have to make it work. And what I did was as Congresswoman Towscher referred to you in the morning, I worked at a restaurant just down, I worked at a gym just down the hill from Capitol Hill, and I served Jim Tows to members of Congress in the morning, and would check them in, and then I would put on my suit and run up the Capitol Hill. And then the evening after I served as an intern, I worked at a restaurant in Capitol Hill, and I would oftentimes serve dinner to members of Congress. And here we are, 11 years later, after serving in Jim Tows in the morning, and serving in meals in the evening, very close to an opportunity to serve with them in the halls of Congress. Thank you. I have to thank my family who are here tonight. My mom, Vicki, my dad, Eric, my little brother's Jacob and Chase, and public service is something I saw as a little kid growing up. My father was a police officer, and served locally on the Dublin School Board, and the model to me had really admired his service to our community, and inspired me to reach toward public service once I finished law school. And you came back home to my community here, but I also wanted to acknowledge some folks here that many of you have known tonight, and a reporter asked me earlier, so there's a lot of people here, and I said, yeah, these aren't people who just showed up for a party. These are the best and in this campaign for over a year. I want to thank our campaign team, Jordan, for serving as our scheduler, and Dean Wallace, who served as our campaign team. I want to thank Josh Schubert, and our poor O'Fellow. I want to thank someone who has become like a big sister to me, you all know Shannon Boer. I want to thank our consultant, Lisa Tucker, who did that stage of song. And finally, 11 years ago, when I served with Congresswoman Coucher's office, I worked with another intern named Melinda Daley, who was the part right here. And Melinda married C.J. Daley. You were going to be making this decision, and I called C.J. with the crazy idea of running for Congress, C.J. said absolutely not and run up the phone on me. You can't. You can't call back. He said, I think we can make this work. He's been on board for the very beginning. I want to thank you. But more than anything, I want to thank you, because when we had this idea that this district deserves new representation, that it deserves new energy, and a member of Congress, who's going to show up to work hard every day in these tough changing times, many people disfounded us and told us we were crazy. We didn't have a chance. And they told us, how are you going to find a million dollars to run for Congress? How are you going to find the endorsements from everyone in your party that you're going to need? And guess what? We never found a million dollars. We never found all of the endorsements from the party. But what I found was you. And you believed in me. And together we found voters who wanted to change in Congress. We found voters who wanted to go back to the days when Ellen Towsher served in Congress, and it wasn't a bad word for reach across the aisle and work with the other party. voters here. voters are sick and hired at Congressional agreement. And they want a member to go back there and work with anyone who is ready to work with them. That's what I hope to do. The results again. It's still early. They look very good for us, but they are a testament to the hard work that we put in day in, day out for the last year. If you look at the fun facts up here, there's no secret to how we got to this point. 65,000 doors we knocked on. 25,000 people at home. That's how we did it. We picked up the phone. We went doorstep to doorstep, main street to main street. We told them we wanted the job. We thought we could do it better. And so far right now it looks like they're rewarding us, the rewarding you for putting your faith in me. So I want to thank you all again. Thank you for being here and never, ever doubt that they grew up people. United by a common goal to work together to bring change to make all the difference in the world. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise today on behalf of the future form to provide an update on our past years work and activity and to discuss the work we must still do to move America's Millennials forward. Yesterday April 12th marked the one-year anniversary of future form and what a year it's been. I encourage everyone at home to follow along as we talk about these issues this afternoon at hashtag future form on Twitter or Instagram and Facebook. Send us your questions I'll look at them live here on the floor and talk about them and continue the dialogue beyond today's conversation. Our membership has grown from 14 members a year ago when we started to 18 of the house's youngest members. We've traveled to 14 cities now across this great nation from San Diego, California to Manchester, New Hampshire and to most recently last week hosted by representatives to get, pull us and pearl mutter and Denver. We're even joined there in Denver by our house minority whip, Steny Hoyer. On each visit we talked to young people at universities, community colleges, co-working spaces, and startup companies to learn about the issues most important to them. The issues that they are finding as their own personal barriers to success. Overwhelmingly we've heard Millennials across the nation share that they're most concerned about issues relating to student loan debt, college affordability, climate change, and campaign finance reform. I want to talk about a few of these issues and first start with student loan debt. At many of these sites we ask people with a polling app, what issue is most important to you? And across the country the issue that we've seen most often, regardless of what part of the country we are in, what crowd we are in front of has been student loan debt. Now this is an issue that is very personal to me. I just brought my own student loan debt just under $100,000 within the last few months. And I have seen in my own life in my constituents' lives in California's East Bay, and what the people we've talked to with these future form discussions, that student loan debt has put an entire generation into financial quicksand. And it affects almost every life decision that young people are making. The biggest decisions you'll make in your life. The decision to start a family. We are delaying that decision by about five years later than the generation before us. The ability to buy a house. We are perhaps the least home-owning generation America has ever known. The decision and the ability to go out on your own and start your own business. Well actually, Millennial Entrepreneurship is on the decline. From 2014 to 2015, 5% fewer Millennials started a business. How is that? You look at Silicon Valley, you look at Silicon Alley, you look at Silicon Beach, you look up in the Northwest, it's Silicon Forest. You see all of these startups across our country and you think, well, this is the startup generation. In fact, we're more risk averse than you would think. It's because of the student loan debt that we carry and makes it so hard to go out on your own, to find that capital you need, to take that risk, to start a business, to create jobs that will help grow our economy. These are the four issues we're seeing that student loan debt is affecting. Starting the family, buying a home, starting a business, and then finally being able to save. We are also the generation that has saved the least of any generation that has ever come before us. And it makes sense, right? Every month you have approximately 40 million young people with 1.3 trillion dollars in student loan debt, hundreds of dollars each month going out the window, going to pay off this debt, making it very hard for you to rent near where you work, let alone even realize that American dream of home ownership. Now while higher education also remains a worthwhile investment, we have found on our tour that by 2018, 63% of new jobs will require a college education. But here's the problem. The cost of college continues to go up. And one of our biggest challenges, perhaps, is making and having generations that have come before us understand that what they experienced 30, 40 years ago is just not what young people are going through today. It's apples and oranges in terms of experiences. In fact, the cost of college tuition has gone up higher and faster than any other good or service that Americans consume. In California, for example, in the 60s and 70s, if you were qualified and you were able, you could go to a UC University of California school and walk away with essentially a debt-free education. The return on that investment, when Californians and the federal government valued public education as a public good, was a workforce that built the greatest tech and biotech economy that the world has ever seen. The tech economy that drives Northern California, the biotech economy that is striving down in San Diego, the minds that are powering the inventive forces in the entertainment industry down in Los Angeles. That's the return on investment that we received when we treat the education as a public good in California. And you could have a UC degree and walk away with a debt-free education. Now, an issue that is also important to millennials and new to future form and affecting young Americans is the issue of diversity in the tech industry. We love the tech industry in California that has created so many new jobs and a lot of traffic to go with it, but people who are driving to good-paying jobs. Silicon Valley in the Bay Area is at the helm of America's burgeoning tech industry, which is constantly developing innovative ways to interact with in a global environment and compete in the 21st century. These cutting-edge companies are creating new ways to communicate, travel, buy, sell, and listen. But the tech industry is led by some of the best and the brightest our nation has to offer. But there are some statistics about the tech industry I want to share with you that are quite disturbing. The tech industry is not as diverse as California or our country is. Millennials are at the center of this industry. They are the largest generation in the US workforce. By 2020, millennials will make up 50 percent of the global workforce. However, over the past two to three years, major concerns have been raised that tech lacks one major component. Where the largest workforce America has ever known, where the largest and most diverse generation America has ever known, but the tech industry is missing a diverse workforce. Despite making up significant portions of the US population, women and minorities are drastically underrepresented in this industry. Let me give you an example. In the United States, women can pose 50.8 percent of our population. However, women only make up about one third of the tech workforce. Ethnic diversity in tech tells a similar story. 8 percent of the tech workforce is Hispanic. 7 percent is African American. 23 percent is Asian and 60 percent white. How can we resolve this? How many tech firms have made great strides toward improving workforce gender in ethnic diversity by releasing workforce data and creating internal programs to address this disparity? However, action must continue to be taken every single day to address the root of the problem, like improving access to STEM education. The tech industry also needs to seriously examine recruitment measures in order to encourage a more diverse workforce. I recently introduced the STEM K2 Career Act. This bill would provide federal loan forgiveness for STEM teachers and low-income schools. Create a tax credit for paid STEM internships and apprenticeships and ensure that 7 percent of federal work study funds are used for STEM jobs. This would help make sure that every corner in America, every classroom across our country is treated equally and receives the same amount of funding for STEM and makes sure that every child has that freedom to dream. I'm also a co-sponsor of Representative Rick Larson of Washington's Youth Access to American Jobs Act, which will connect students to training and STEM skill positions to prepare them for well-paying jobs. And just last month, I signed a letter urging for an increase in federal support of Hispanic-serving institutions. Someone in the house who has worked on this issue, who is my neighbor in the East Bay and someone I've been proud to serve with, is Congresswoman Barbara Lee. And I'd like to welcome my distinguished colleague to add to this discussion and start Congresswoman by asking, this is an industry that has expanded beyond just San Francisco and Silicon Valley. We're seeing major investments put into Oakland and also out in the Tri-Valley. And so what are you hearing back in the bay at home outside of that warriors fever? Because tonight they're going to set the NBA single season winds record. But outside of that fever, what are we hearing at home about the tech industry and what we can do better? Thank you very much. First of all, let me thank you so much for your tremendous leadership in future form. I want to thank you also for, you know, really stepping up since you have been here in Congress not only in showing dedication and phenomenal representation for your constituents, but also you've shown such a tremendous ability to organize your peers and to really focus on the issues that really give our young people, Millenials, hope that they can actually achieve the American dream. So thank you very much. I'm really proud to share our region with you, Congresswoman Smallwell. And I want to first congratulate you also because I think today is the anniversary of future form one year. That's right one year. And you're doing such critical work to make college affordable and debt free and to really provide opportunities for our young people and our middle-innies. So thank you. You know, we represent the East Bay as I said and you said, and for years now this is nothing new to us. I mean, I have my office full of cases that go back actually 10 years of qualified people of color who wanted to work in the tech sector and never could get in the door. And let me also say that 40, 50 percent of the jobs in the tech sector are non-tech related. They're human resources attorneys, lawyers, jobs that many people qualify for, many people of color and still they have been shut out from these opportunities. So this is an important issue to talk about. Tech is making a home for itself in my district and your district and creating new jobs. And unfortunately too many of my African-American and Latino constituents have been locked out of these opportunities for years which have been created by the region's booming sector. And believe you me, it's not unique to your district or my district. It's a systemic problem that we need to address across the country. When major tech firms have released workforce data and mind you many have not. We have seen that as some firms employees that our African-American can make up as much as 7 percent of the workforce. At other firms this can be low, can be as below 0 percent. I don't know how you get below 0 percent but some don't even think about it. Despite the fact that African-Americans for example make up 14 percent of the American population. And so that's why I'm really honored to serve with our Congressional Black Caucus chair chairman Butterfield as his co-chair of the CBC's diversity task force. In May of last year a task force launched the tech 2020 initiative to increase diversity and inclusion of the tech sector by 2020 specifically as it relates to African-American diversity. And let me just take a moment to thank Reverend Jesse Jackson and Rainbow Push because they have been for several years now really making sure these companies commit to releasing their data and coming up with a plan to address inclusion and diversity. The core principles of tech 2020 initiative let me lay out very quickly. Tee, transparency, education and training, corporate responsibility, investment, hiring and retention. Now transparency means ensuring the company's set and achieve inclusion goals, release their data annually and put this information in the central location for the public to access. Education and training, STEM education commitment to long-term STEM investments working with minority serving institutions, Hispanic serving institutions, HBCUs, advancing public and private investment in education. Corporate responsibility and investment. That means working to increase board of directed diversity. When you look at the boards you don't see much inclusion at all in diversity. We have to target philanthropic investments, expand and venture capital to diverse ideas, to new young ideas, seek out and seek out excuse me diversity in the supplier area and help small businesses, young, millennial, small businesses grow. The last principle hiring and retention and means encouraging companies to provide specific programs and goals and timetables focused on inclusion and recruit from minority serving institutions and invest in African American and Latino employees. The tech 2020 initiative we've taken these principles on the road to the boardrooms of some of the biggest names in the tech sector. We're continuing this conversation with the head of future forum because this really is about the future. In our district we have many, many young people, many young African American men, excuse me, men and women who are working on coding, black girls code. When you look at some of the investments that the K-Poor Institute mentioned free to K-Poor have made in terms of investments and firms that require inclusion and STEM education, it's really phenomenal. We've seen companies add highly qualified people of color business leaders to their board of directors not enough, only a couple, but we're going to continue to work to develop and implement and most importantly disclose their diversity and their inclusion plans. We've also made progress in gaining commitments to investments in science, technology, engineering and math and of course the STEM pipeline to help educate and create the next generation of coders, inventors and tech leaders. So last year I was proud to lead a letter and it was co-signed by 67 of our colleagues to support the president's computer science for all initiative which will ensure that every student from preschool to grade 12 will be able to learn how to code. This initiative specifically focuses on girls and students of color and will help us close the achievement gap in STEM education. These are all steps in the right direction but we can and we must do more. America has become more and more diverse, increasing diversity and inclusion and the tech sector. It really is not only a moral imperative, it is an economic imperative. As a former business owner myself I can tell you that diversity is really good for business, it's good for the bottom line. When you have a diverse and dynamic employee base, new doors of opportunity open and so I'm very pleased to be helping to lead this effort with our chair of the Black Hawks and Mr. Butterfield and other colleagues in yourself to achieve parity in the tech sector. I also look forward to working with future forum in addressing these critical issues as we move forward with future forum in terms of the next generation of leaders. Young people are concerned about student loan debt, college affordability, climate change, all the issues that really create a planet worthy of the future of our young people. So as future members of the modern workforce, they are also concerned about equity and so I have to commend you once again in future forum for your vision and your efforts to engage and empower our future leaders. I know that together we can and we will achieve a future where people of color, African-Americans and Latinos are fully represented within every level of the tech sector. From entry level coders and HR representatives, legal professionals, C-suite officers and corporate directors. And finally, let me just say one effort that some of the companies are mounting, which I think you know about, but which we need to talk a little bit more about in the future and future forums should look at it. The unconscious bias studies that these companies are undertaking, because oftentimes it's the culture of the organization and unconscious biases that translate into policies and programs that create discriminatory effect, which in fact need to be addressed in debt with. And they're so unconscious that people don't even realize that this is the ultimate outcome of those unconscious bias. Do you think that shining a light on workforce data is probably one of the best ways to kind of reverse an unconscious bias that if, you know, unless you're forced to look at the numbers and the behaviors of your company, you're not going to make a change that results in having a diverse workforce. Yeah, absolutely. If you don't have the facts, if you don't have the data, how do you know that first of all that there is an issue and a problem of exclusion? And secondly, oftentimes, you know, people, you know, higher people work with people who they are familiar with. There's some systemic issues that unless you have the data, you don't know what these systemic issues are. And so that is absolutely essential. And that's why we continue to ask tech companies to release their data and to really be transparent. And so you have to know what the issues are and what the problem is before you can look at how to rectify it and how to move forward. So I think that many employees and many corporate officials want to do the right thing. They just have not done the right thing. And they're trying to begin to understand what to do next. And so future forum, the congressional black caucus, our track caucus, all of us here, our democratic caucus have really been working hard to try to get this moving forward. And in your district, you have one of the best universities in the world, UC Berkeley. And we have heard on our future forum tour from young students who are either right out of college or about to be out of college, that the amount of debt they have is driving the decision about where to work that a lot of times, their choices are limited to where their parents live because they know they can't afford to live in the Bay Area. So they're going to have to boom or hang back home with their parents who have just gotten used to them being out of the house. And so what have you heard from the students or the recent graduates in your area about how student loan debt is affecting major life decisions? Student loan debt really is hampering our young people from moving forward. They're concerned mainly about how to get a job that's going to pay enough money to pay down their debt. When really they should be looking at how to move forward to get the type of job they want, buy home if they want, have a family or do some of the things that their dreams have been in their minds and in their vision and in their heart for years. I mean now their dreams are deferred because they have to just hang on with their families and pay student loan debt. And secondly, in our area, the cost of the housing is outrageous. We met with the Secretary of HUD last week to try to determine what the federal government could do to help with first displacement and secondly to help develop more affordable housing, which of course will help young people because they can't afford to live now in the East Bay or in the Bay Area. Really, our region is just excessively expensive and we've got to figure out how young people can stay where they want to stay and how they can have the type of life they deserve. They've gotten a degree. I went to UC Berkeley. That's my alma mater, Go Bears. And I know what a phenomenal education it is. But I also know when you get out, you think that that degree, that piece of paper is going to give you is a ticket to something better. And here you end up having to go back home, live with your parents and pay down your student debt. That's outrageous. It doesn't make any sense. Our young people deserve more. That's right. And a lot of times I've told young people, our generation is the least homony generation America's ever known. In the Bay Area, or the LA area, they say forget homony. We just want to be able to rent near where we live. And right now, the rents are so expensive. Oakland now ranks in the top five most expensive rents in the country. It's outrageous. Home ownership is not even a dream anymore that young people have. And how do you acquire wealth in this country? When you look at what happened with African Americans, for example, in Latinos during the subprime meltdown in crisis, our net worth is gone. Most of that was an equity in our home. Young people deserve to be able to buy house so they can begin to acquire some wealth so they can do what they want to do with their lives. And until we get this house in peace, we're not going to get anything else right in terms of any quality and equity for our young people or for people of color. That's right. And you know, as we talk to young people, and we listen to these stories across the country, it is heartening though to offer solutions. And I know you are a part of many of the solutions that the future forum has been promoting. One of them is the bank on students emergency loan refinancing bill. And this is Joe Courtney's bill, our colleague, who says that if the banks can refinance at the lowest rate, if a homeowner can refinance at the lowest rate, an auto loan can be refinance at the lowest rate. Why can our students refinance at the lowest rate? Why should they have to pay so much money and interest and not get more competitive rates? And there's no reason why. Because here you have young people starting out, making a life for themselves, they should be able to do the same thing. The banking institution should allow young people the same opportunities as they do other people who own mortgages and who own cars. And this to me is it's discriminatory. I'm really pleased to be a co-sponsor of the bill. And I hope we can pass this on a bipartisan basis. I would give people a little bit of hope, young people just a bit of hope that it can be done and that they can be made hold and that their college education, their sacrifices that they made, it was worth it because now they're going to the next step. That's right. In the Bay Area, young people are so collaborative and inventive that they have powered this innovative innovation economy. And then they look at Washington and they wonder, well, why isn't the majority party in the house collaborating on these student loan bills? If you look at every student loan bill that's out there right now, I think nine out of ten of them have been offered by our side. And this is an issue that should not be owned by a political party. People are hurting out there. Republican young people are hurting also. So I would think that the majority party would want to help their young people also find a path to the American dream and certainly refinancing their student loan debt is a major step. This should be bipartisan, it should be non-partisan, and we should be working together to get this pass. I don't know if you have any constituents who are in bankruptcy because of student loan debt, but we have found that three things in this country will follow you to your grave and have no statute of limitations. Murder, treason, and student loan debt. So we have constituents who have had their social security garnished because of outstanding student loan debt, and people who cannot discharge as they get that second chance in life that Jubilee, that bankruptcy is, they can't discharge their student loan debt. It hangs over them until they go to the grave. Yeah, many constituents are in this very similar circumstances, Congressman Swahwell, and on top of that, their credit score goes down. And so then they can't even buy a car even if they wanted to. They're not able to do anything else because they're delayed on their payments. They're behind because they can't afford it. Then they get dinged on their credit score. Then they can't buy anything else on credit. And so it's a vicious cycle. They end up in debt and out there not being able to participate in the mainstream economic fabric of our society because of that. That's right. And another bill we have to support that is the private student loan bankruptcy fairness act offered by Congressman Cohen of Tennessee who seeks to address this issue and relieve young people from having to have this follow them for a lifetime. Well, Congressman, I'm glad you came and joined us to talk about diversity and tech and about larger future form goals. And I look forward to continuing to work with you in the East Bay and across our country to take as many young people as we can out of financial quicksand. Thank you. And thank you for your leadership. And I'm confident we can with your leadership and with all of us working together. I know that both Democrats and Republicans want the same thing. I'm confident of that, but we're just not matching our rhetoric with with reality. So hopefully they will begin to understand the majority will that this is good for America, not just for Democrats and not just for our young people. That's right. Thank you, Congressman. I'll be now I also see in the house with us this afternoon is another California colleague, someone who I was hoping maybe could talk a little bit about what students and her part of California are going through. One of the youngest members of the house as well. That's Congresswoman Norma Torres. So Congressman, we're just talking about student loan debt. And we've got in California the greatest education system in the world. But because of the amount of student loan debt young people are facing, it is just putting them as I said in financial quicksand. And we've got a lot of solutions here in the house. But anything you're hearing in your congressional district from young people and what they want to see from their leaders. Absolutely. And thank you so much for bringing this topic to the board. And we're celebrating a year of the future forum tonight. One year that is wonderful. Not this issue is not limited to the students. I at a Congress in your corner last November, I heard from parents of a constituent who were nearly in bankruptcy. Student loan debt and the parents are taking on costly assisted living. So you're right. So thank you for sharing what's going on in your area. And maybe my other colleague, another one of California's millennial-minded members down in the LA area, Tony Cardinus. Tony, what are you hearing as we celebrate a year of being on the road with future forum and talking to thousands of young people? What are you hearing about student loan debt or any issues that are important to millennials? What I'm hearing, unfortunately. And once again, thank you so much for bringing this issue to the floor. It's incredibly important not just for millennials, but as our colleague Norma Torres pointed out for people who are in the retirement age, people who want to retire, but can't because they have these generational issues that are costly and they can't move on and then follow through with their version of the American dream in different phases of their life. What I'm hearing is that this is not just an issue of young people who are in college. This is an issue of entire families wondering whether or not their children can afford to do that and whether the family can come together for that bright individual who wants to succeed and wants to get that education and yet they're doubting themselves as to whether or not that's the path for them. And that's unfortunate because the fact of the matter is the United States of America for many, many generations has been the place for hope and expectation of a brighter future for generations yet at the same time because in my opinion, Congress is not doing enough to make sure that we can write this situation. We can make sure that you can write size the environment of making sure that when a young bright person in America wants to get an education that there are ways in which they can afford to do that regardless of where they come from, regardless of whether their parents were farm workers like my parents or whether their parents live on the other side of town where they can afford to do that. Our environments and the universities shouldn't be left only to the individuals who have the affluency to be able to be in that environment. One of the reasons why we've created these wonderful universities that have five and ten and twenty-thirty thousand people there is so they can be in a clectic environment. So people can learn to become friends with people that otherwise they might not have rubbed elbows with. So what I'm hearing is that people are afraid, too many Americans are afraid, I'm hearing that too many young bright individuals are doubting whether or not they can afford to get that degree, not that they can't do it, not that they're not bright enough. The problem is that what I'm hearing from my constituents and people around America is that it is tough to make that decision because too many young people now have examples that they're in debt, 100,000, 200,000, 300,000 dollars and then on top of that they can't find a right-sized job to fit their skill set and then on top of that they've got this mounting debt and that's something that too many people are afraid to enter into. That's unfortunate. Shouldn't happen in our country. I'm glad that you're bringing this issue up. Let's continue to try to do many, many things about writing this ship that we have about our young people being too afraid to incur the kind of debt that they're forced to do in order to get an education. Amen. Well said. And I think young Californians in my experience, they want us to be as collaborative and solving this problem as they are and charting the innovation economy because you're right. And out of those environments in our UC and Cal State systems and our community colleges, we're creating minds and experiences that are building this new economy. And so they look to us and say, why aren't Democrats and Republicans working together? And right now I see our caucus is the only one that's offering solutions. And I think we're putting our hands out. They're saying, work with us. We're ready to talk about this, but you got to come to the table because Republican and Democratic kids across this country are in financial quicksand and our county on that. So thank you, Tony, thank you, Norma. And so that will conclude our one-year celebration of future form. We're certainly not looking backwards. We're looking to the future. We have more visits ahead across the country, across California, of course, with my colleagues who have participated already. And thank you and continue this conversation with us at hashtag future forum or, of course, follow along at atrepswabel at Twitter, Snapchat and Facebook. But this generation is aspirational and optimistic. It just needs its leaders here in this house. And the majority party, I think, to join with the Democrats to put forward solutions that can move our generation forward. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back. The gentleman yields back.",

        "transcript": " That, let me introduce, again, my classmate and colleague, a man who has been doing an enormous amount of work for our caucus and for the people of this country, Eric Swannwell. Eric. Thank you, Representative Kildin and to my colleagues and Leader Pelosi for holding this conference. What we have heard here is that people across our country are asking House Republicans on the issues that matter most to them to simply do your job. When it comes to addressing corporate inversions, people are saying, if you want to help me protect my job, you need to do your job. When it comes to stopping the spread of the Zika virus, people across the country are telling House Republicans it's time to honor the administration's requests and do your job. When it comes to collaborating with Democrats and passing a budget on time, the American people expect House Republicans to do their job. When it comes to standing for the 9,000 children in Flint and providing the same relief that we always provide to communities in need in this country, people expect House Republicans to do their job. Over the past year, the future form has taken 18 of the youngest House Democrats to 14 cities across America. We've talked to young people, thousands of them, community colleges, colleges, and workforce places. And what we have heard from Republicans and Democrats that like is that access to college and student loan debt is the number one issue facing young people. 40 million young people have $1.3 trillion in student loan debt and are stuck in financial quicksand. And so they ask to House Republicans, what are you doing to be just as collaborative as we are as a generation? House Democrats have introduced legislation to address this. Congressman Joe Courtney has a bill that has 181 co-sponsors that would allow young people to refinance their student loan debt just as you can for a home loan and an auto loan. But it's been 392 days since that bill has been introduced and not a single Republican has stepped up to do their job and join Democrats to put more money and more pockets to help students out of this financial quicksand. It's no wonder that young people are so disillusioned and so disenchanted with the way that Washington is working today under House Republican leadership. Further in action will only engender further distrust in their government. And so today collectively we are saying on these issues from our budget to corporate inversions to the Zika virus to the Flint water crisis and this financial aid student loan debt crisis in our country, House Republicans, it's time to do your job. And with that, I'll turn to leader Pelosi for questions. Thank you very much. Congressman Swalwell has the director of the future forum as the leader of the future forum. I thank you for your important statement for your leadership across the country and for your strong statement asking Congress to do its job. I thank our distinguished chairman. These statements come from a very deep place with our colleagues. I thank Congressman Viserah for his strong statement on the budget and asking Congress to do its job. Congressman Kildi from a very deep place asking Congress to do its job on Flint, Michigan. And of course, Congresswoman Deloro on the Appropriations Committee has many concerns. That's who wants Congress to do its job. And I thank her for her strong statement regarding Zika. Just as we were coming in here, I was handed this statement. New map finds two billion people at risk of Zika virus. The good news for the United States is that the Kerry Zika can be found as that even though it can be found as far north. Anyway, it talks about half or north. It's coming even though the numbers are not as great in the U.S. yet. So there's reason to be hopeful if we get our job done. You know, a state budget, we say this all the time here, it's supposed to be a statement of our national values. Why have the Republicans not brought a budget to the floor? We have a saying in the world that we live in a public policy. If we want to know your value, if you want to tell us your values, show us your budget. Show us your budget. And I think that one reason that I haven't brought a budget to the floor is that they don't want the public to see their lack of values in their budget. That they would make Medicare, remove the guarantee of Medicare. The list goes on and on. But even that is not cruel enough to some of their members. So maybe they don't want us to see their values. Maybe their values are not cruel enough to get the majority vote of the Republicans. In any case, they should bring it to the floor, do your job. With that, we'll be pleased to take any questions you may have.",

        "transcript": " It's happening to our girls, it's happening to our women, and I'm here to let everyone know that this is happening. Open your mouth. I'm so happy. Whoa! The Democrat crowd is cheering her on. Bare enough, fair enough. Never in a million years that I think I'd see that. Ladies and gentlemen, our friendly neighborhood Feng Feng Banger is running for governor of California. Eric Swalwell, my best friend. Look at us together, man. I'm so happy to be there. So Congressman Swallow is now on the campaign trail, and he had a rally. And we're going to have more people like this video in the first five minutes of me uploading it than he had at his rally. It's a ghost town, and the crowd is very predictable. It's like 90% old liberal women. Nothing wrong with being old, but liberal? Ugh. Anyways, the Chinese by-lover gave the crowd the mic. And when I say fireworks, I mean fireworks commenced. First man, you guys think the most emotionally- when you question him, I'm going to start with you. I was a prosecutor. I was a prosecutor for seven years. And where justice was warranted, and where it was warranted, I showed it. No, he means to say he let the criminals go free and locked up innocent people. And where a stiff punishment was warranted, because somebody I heard, I saw. And I will not be a governor that tolerates violence against women in our state. Period. That's right, man. That's right. Now, as it relates to the issue of trans kids, particularly sports. In women's faces, harassing, and you said it wasn't a thing. 14 times you said it wasn't a thing. So I need you to show all the women of California that you're going to protect us. Women. Are there going to be men allowed in the women's room anymore? No, no, no, woman should be harassed in a locker room. And the strength. Are there going to be women? Are you against men in women's locker rooms and sports? That's all you need to answer. Please. I know. That's not happening. It's happening all around America. There are 25 men in the women's prisons right now. They're picking them out like chicken. Yeah, the trans. A lot of women. And they're raping women. So I don't care if you're on the Democrat side, the Republican side. Oh, Tish Hyman. She's going in on this guy. God bless her soul. If you're on the women's side, people, it's happening to our girls. It's happening to our run. And I'm here to let everyone know that this is happening. Open your mouth. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's happening. Whoa. The Democrat crowd is cheering her on. Baron Af. Fair enough. Never in a million years that I think I'd see that. There are things that people behind black people who they use in our civil rights to push this. If you want to be the governor, you need to do something about it. Because I promise you this, I will not be the last to see of Tish Hyman. Thank you so much. All right. I want to hear that. You're right. Somebody. Oh, he capitulated. He said, all right, find the melanin. Power is getting to me. There are no trans kids. There are no trans kids. There are just children. Stop transforming children. No one can make a decision that young. But I would try, I would transform. It's wrong. It's wrong. It's abuse. Don't trans children. It's abuse. Chance kids. It's no such thing. There's only men and women. Use your brain. Stop with this. Malakis. I also want to know, as governor, I am not going to be the striker of the most important issue. Wow. Give her a presidential medal of freedom. Look at that standoff, ladies and gentlemen. Tish Hyman, you are a hero putting this man in his place like Fengfang did. He looks absolutely clueless. He's never had to deal with this before. The media has shielded these Democrats from accountability. But Tish Hyman has hold them to that fire. This isn't the first time we've heard of Tish Hyman. If you recall, she was the woman who made the video at Gold's Gym where she got kicked out after reporting a man in the woman's bathroom to the staff. And instead of kicking him out, they kicked her out. So that whole thing went viral. Then she confronted Democrat State Senator Scott Weiner. Sorry. I'm so mature. Scott Weiner about the same thing she just confronted Swahla Long. You guys are not protecting one of these things with a chance. It's not right. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Thank you. Am I in the fish? I'm in the fish. You heard me, sister? All right. Don't let them use our blackness and our civil rights as a reason of past weird laws for children to transform. Tish Hyman is quickly becoming the Democrats' worst nightmare in the state of California. The way she approaches them is so good. Because she showers them with compliments like, hey, I know you're trying. And then she rips them apart on national TV. Last time I did the video about her, which I had to remove from YouTube because of a copyright thing. I said that I wanted her to wake up from thinking Democrats were at all in this for the right reason. She was very complimentary of Scott Weiner. Again, I do respect a lot of the things you've done. But I do see a lot of these bills that you've passed that are dangerous for women and young children. And I understand that you're trying to be on a level playing a field. And I'm here representing my community because I hear a lot of things about my community and these bills. And I'm telling you as a woman, first and foremost, that this is dangerous. And we need your help. Because you're in the office, you're going to go into the community spot. I want to support you. I have millions of people behind me. And she had that same kind of energy towards Swallow. I said she should look carefully into these Democrats and she'll realize they don't care about her at all. And they don't do any good. But now I'm realizing there's something genius about it. She comes across as likable and open-minded. And there's no real rebuttal to that. She's able to be loud but still get the crowd on her side while stating brutal truth. And for a lot of these Democrats, they haven't ever heard these words before, especially from a black woman. Men aren't women. They've never heard that. This knowledge is a shock to them. Fangfang's banger is already having a hard time in the gubernatorial race in California. Katie Porter already has tremendous momentum. And California's voting system is so messed up. They do these jungle primaries. So there's like 10 people on the initial primary and the top two go to the runoff. And I can imagine a Republican will get through. And Katie Porter. And there's like 10 other Democrats that are going to be sharring their votes. There's even a chance that Republicans take the top two spots in California. Would have a red governor. Swallow is so low on those polls right now. It's crazy. These interactions certainly don't help them. And we all look forward to him losing. He's really doing us all a favor and taking himself out of Congress and politics altogether. Because if he's not able to become governor of California, he certainly won't be able to win a Senate race against the incumbent. And it would look embarrassing for him to run for Congress again. Oh, Tish, if you want to lesbian and you were 18 years and one day old, I would get on my knees and give you that ring. This is amazing energy. If every mom in this country acted like Tish, Hyman, and protecting their children from the objectionable material Democrats want to shove down their eyeballs, wouldn't we just have a blessed country? Wouldn't there be like no perversion? Wouldn't kids grow up like I did watching Sophia I, instead of trans drag shows? Huge credit to Tish Hyman. She's a complete hero. Thank you all for watching. I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did. God bless and goodbye.",

        "transcript": " Yes, I'm 50. Do you think they knew the freedom writers at Selma, the suffragists at Seneca Falls, the soldiers at Shiloh? Do you think they knew they were at the hinge of history? Sensing whether they succeeded would determine the fate and survival of the country. Raise your right hand if you believe our countries in trouble. And keep it up. Raise your left hand if this is the most trouble you've ever seen our country in. That's why we're here tonight. And we're going to do something about it. We have seen cruel presidents before. We have seen incompetent presidents before, but we've never seen such cruelty and such incompetence in one person. Donald Trump calls you stupid, weak, failing. But you know what we've learned, Mr. President? And those words don't describe us. They describe you. They describe you. And tonight on the eve of passing prop 50, and you have all made a decision to pass prop 50, I want to tell you what you're doing. You, me, we are writing America's come back story. And it starts tomorrow in California. So I want to thank Julian and Cheryl, the Folsom Area Democratic Club for again convening us and inviting me back. I also want to thank the Folsom Police Department, who stand guard in our community every day and are doing that here tonight. Shout out to some of our canvassers and and Phil Duffield. They knocked on 671 doors. So a lot of doors. Katherine Omorda knocked on 528 doors. Also, the Folsom Area Dems, they personalize 6,500 door hangers. I also just want to ask, is there anyone here who is volunteered in some way to help pass prop 50? Give yourself a round of applause. I have a day job. I represent the 14 Congressional District in the beautiful East Bay. However, for the last year, I've been doing Kevin Kylie's job. But let me tell you about Kevin come lately. Because this guy, this guy is the greatest champion now for independent redistricting commissions. It's really amazing. It's like he's expert in the field. It's as if he wrote the proposition that passed it in 2010 himself. But what's so rich is that Kevin come lately voted every single time against the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would have independent redistricting in every state, not just in California. It would get rid of dirty maps and dirty money. He voted against it every single time. And Kevin come lately. When the president told Governor Abbott in Texas he needed 5 seats, didn't make a peep or a squeak. Didn't say anything. When the president went to Indiana, Missouri, Florida, Ohio, Kevin didn't say anything until his own seat was threatened. Well, guess what, Kevin? Two little, two late, your seat is gone. It's gone. The people of Folsom are going to get a member of Congress who shows up, who cares, and is representative to the needs of this community. And I'm not going to have to do your job anymore, Kevin. And Prop 50, by the way, I want to tell you why it's so important. Yes, we match what was taken in Texas. And for too long, Democrats have stood on virtue and modesty and upon Mount Olympus. And we fight all of these battles with one hand tied behind our back. And as one constituent told me, for you guys, it's usually the upper hand. For too long, we've done that. Prop 50 is not just drawing lines on a map. It's drawing a line in the sand. And we are saying, don't poke the bear. And they poke. And I can't help you now, Kevin Kylie. I can't help the other four Republicans now. They poke the bear. And the bear, you, is roaring back. So what are the stakes? The stakes are everything. The stakes are everything. You see, Donald Trump and the Republicans are not going to the midterm voters to make a case about the big brutal bill. They don't want to defend disappearing people in our community who go to the grocery store with their kids and don't come home. They don't want to defend the conflicts that they've added to the map that were supposed to end on day one. We're going to war with Nigeria now? No, seriously. He saw a story on Fox News, a couple nights ago. And this week, we're going to war with Nigeria. But he should still get the Nobel Peace Prize. He doesn't want to defend any of that. Instead, his plan for the midterms is simple. Just make the map harder for Democrats. That's it. That's it. And so that's the stakes is to cheat to rig district, rig district. That's what we're doing. Prop 50 goes to you to the voters. You'll decide whether you want to match what Texas does or whether we want to wake up the day after the midterms, still in the minority, but at least able to say we preserve the Independent Redistricting Commission. I don't think any of us want to say that. No, do you want to say that? So what are the stakes? Everything. I want to tell you the president said on day one he was going to go after the most violent immigrants in our community. I was okay with that. I was willing to cosplay with Kristi Nome and maybe put on a border patrol vest and go out and hunt for violent criminals. I would do that. That's not what they're doing. They're getting and going after American citizens, a six-year-old American citizen fighting cancer was deported. They're going through home depot parking lots, through vineyards, chasing people through car washes. I want to tell you in a democratic majority we are unmasking ice. In a democratic majority the mass come off. It's un-American and I'll tell you is the son of a cop, is the son of a cop and a brother to two cops and a prosecutor who worked with some of the bravest cops. I've put a lot of bad guys away. I don't see any agency in law enforcement routinely running around through our communities on identified and wearing masks. They're scaring the hell out of women, they're scaring the hell out of their kids and they're not even getting the most violent that we were promised they'd picked up. So accountability is coming. Accountability is coming. That's the stakes. I'm going to lower the costs on day one. Remember that one? That doozy? It's day 300. He's 0 for 300. We're paying more for almost everything because of his idiotic tariff policy. We're paying more for everything. In a democratic majority we can reverse and stop the tariff. Something Republicans are unwilling to do. Those are the stakes. What's the absentee file? We are in an Epstein shutdown to your point. I'm not kidding. We are in an Epstein shutdown right now. The speaker of the house is acting as a pedophile protector. The most notorious sex trafficking individual ever to walk this earth is being protected. Because if the speaker convened Congress we'd swear in the 218th vote to release the Epstein files. The Epstein files by the way to the Maga movement and they weren't wrong to want to know who was in it. They're just a little surprised I guess to find out how close the guy they voted for is to it. It is like flower to cake. It's a main ingredient for them and he's fully himself if he thinks and is the speaker mentioned that introduced me. I'm related to a lot of these folks. It's my family. I was raised by Republicans. Married a who's your from Southern Indiana. When we're around Republicans all the time you promise that you were going to tell them every person who's in the Epstein files and now you're bearing it a mile beneath the earth and you think they're going to go for that? They're not going to go for that. You're not going to go for that. But the speaker of the House has Congress shut down. The country shut down because he doesn't want anyone to know how close the president was to Jeffrey Epstein. So yes in a democratic majority we will do with the president actually promised we will release the Epstein files. So those are some of the stakes but I also want to tell you about one of the greatest stakes. That's our health. That's our health. If you're fighting an illness or disease nothing else in your life or community matters. It's the most important thing you have to do is take care of yourself or loved one. This president failed to put in place subsidies that would help hard working Americans and we are all seeing today the sticker shock of health insurance that costs 300 to 400 percent more and all he has concepts of a plan. We're back to that again. 40 billion dollars that went to Argentina. 230 million dollars that he's paying himself in the first lawsuit he actually won because he's the plaintiff and the judge and 300 million dollars paid for by God knows who for a ballroom that we don't need but will come down the first day of a democratic administration. But the worst thing that he's doing a 40 percent cut to the National Institute of Health. Before I came out here I spoke with an ALS patient and I asked if there's anything I could do to help her. I'm privileged to know the best doctors and researchers in the world and I told her if I know the person you know the person tell me what I can do to help and she didn't say get me into this trial get me this drug lower this cost she said just stop the cuts to the National Institutes of Health so people like me can have a fighting chance. It's time that we kill cancer and diseases like it not kill cancer and disease research and that's what he's doing. The last time I was with you I told you my own mother was in a cancer battle and she fought like hell for six years and she passed away two months ago and she's no longer on this earth but her spirit is in this fight it's in this fight and it doesn't matter whether you're a Republican or a Democrat and she was a Republican we all agree that the most basic thing we can do with the resources we have is the greatest country in the world the greatest state in the world is to take those resources and seek cures not just cures for the billionaires kills for cures for every single person who is sick in our community and that's what this president is taking away from us the hope for a cure and that's what we are going to put back when we win the house it's a California comeback story we delivered seven seats in 2018 when we won the midterms the most seats any state delivered so we're going to pass prop 50 and we're going to add five more seats next November and when we lead again yes there will be accountability so if you made a dirty drug deal as a university president or a law firm managing partner or an entertainment company if you made some deal that you thought you'd get away with with the president i have news for you your ass is going to be in a witness chair the judiciary committee and i hope it's plain and i hope you can answer for it and i hope the american people know everything that you did because accountability is coming it's coming you will be in that chair you will answer our questions and if you think democrats are weak or we don't have to spine we will not forget and folks it will all come out it will all come out so there will be accountability there will be a subpoena power but we will advance our values with the power of the purse and we won't be so weak as we have been in the past when we lead the agenda that Nancy Pelosi passed in the house in 2021 was a bold agenda that was defeated in the senate not by republicans but by weak democrats who let the filibuster get in the way we cannot be so weak when we have power again can't be so weak so here's my message when people say what is the democratic message i know how hard you work i'm the son of a cop the son of a mom who worked multiple jobs to raise four boys and all they believe was that if you work hard you do better for yourself and dream bigger for their kids i saw my parents and people like you bet on yourself every single day and so if you bet on yourself your country should bet on your job and it's wages going up your country should bet on your health care and cures for everyone who's sick your country should bet on your kids and for them to have the best education not just in our state not just in the country but in the world and if you bet on yourself our country should bet on your safety to send your kid to school and know they'll come home at the end of the day because we've taken the most dangerous weapons away from the most dangerous people and if you bet on yourself you should be able to know your country bets on your democracy there'll be tournaments on the supreme court no more dirty maps no more dirty money and if you bet on yourself your country will bet on your rights and if you're a woman you can make your own decisions about your own body so if you bet on yourself also your country should bet on your future and your dreams that's what passing prof 50 means are you all in the past prof 50 if you're all in i'm all in are you all in the past prof 50 if you're all in i'm all in are you all in the past prof 50 if you're all in i'm all in let's go past prof 50 thank you for some thank you for some",

        "transcript": " Welcome to Capital Connection. I'm Assembly Speaker, Pro Tem, Kevin Mullin, and I'm excited to update you on the 2016 legislative year. Newly elected Assembly Speaker, Anthony Rendon, has appointed his leadership team, and I am honored to be reappointed as Speaker Pro Tem. I plan to continue presiding over floor sessions in the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship. I am carrying a total of 20 bills this session that address clean tech and biotech, elections and voter access, and two of the most pressing issues in San Mateo County, housing and transportation. Workforce housing is a top policy priority for me this year. San Mateo County and the Bay Area overall is experiencing a perfect storm of circumstances that contribute to rising housing costs. The Bay Area is a great place to live, has a large and growing population, is home to a successful innovation economy, and has high demand for service sector jobs, and yet has a dearth of developable land. The elimination of redevelopment agencies in 2011 hit affordable housing production hard since they were the number one producer of low and moderate income housing. In an effort to address the lack of a coherent statewide housing policy, I have introduced AB-2502, which would reinstate a law allowing local governments to pass inclusionary ordinances to require developers to include a certain percentage of newly constructed housing units for low and moderate income renters. I have also been appointed by the speaker to serve on a housing working group, and I support allocating a portion of the 2016-17 General Fund budget to affordable housing programs. On the transportation side, I will continue to work with leaders in the assembly to provide a comprehensive solution to the funding shortfall for street and highway repair, as well as public transit. I have introduced AB-230, which will allow CalTrain and Bart to process low to mid-cost procurements in a more efficient manner. I have also introduced AB-2126, which will increase the number of projects CalTrain can build using the construction manager general contractor method from 6 to 12, which will increase opportunities to reduce costs and expedite congestion relief projects in the state. I am also exploring avenues to provide a dedicated revenue source of funding for CalTrain. While these and other bills are now on their way through the committee process, the budget is a significant topic of discussion since June 15th is the deadline to pass a balance budget. In my role as speaker pro-Tam and as a member of the budget committee, I am committed to working with our leadership team and my Bay Area colleagues to craft a bipartisan approach that balances spending on vital priorities, pays down debt, and addresses our long-term fiscal liabilities. The governor's proposed budget takes a prudent approach, setting aside dollars for critical healthcare funding, increases education funding, and allows for a $2 billion allocation to the rainy day fund and pays down debt. And while there is no question we need to ensure a strong reserve in the event of an economic downturn, we cannot stand by while our middle class is continually priced out of housing and forced to move further and further away from where they work. I remain committed to crafting a state budget that balances the pressing need for infrastructure and transportation improvements while also making sure we address the massive gap in funding for workforce housing left by the dissolution of redevelopment agencies. In spite of these challenges, I have every confidence that working together we will be on track for a sixth consecutive on-time balance budget. I look forward to sharing more in the next edition of Capital Connection. Until then, you can learn more about my bill package by following me on Facebook or by visiting my website. Thanks for watching.",

        "transcript": " Democrat Kevin Mullin is the new representative for California's 15th Congressional District, one of nearly 80 new House members in the 118th Congress. He told C-SPAN about the advice his predecessor former representative Jackie Spear gave him coming into the job and about what he was doing in state and local government before being elected to Congress. So I was a California State Assembly member. I was the Speaker of Pro-Tam of our California State Assembly, the number two officer in the Assembly for 10 years. And prior to that, I was a City Council Member and Mayor in the city of South San Francisco, which we like to remind people of the birthplace of biotechnology. If you fly out of SFO, you'll see South San Francisco, the industrial city, big white letters on our sign hill. That is my hometown and I was a small business owner before that. I had a small communications business and I was a legislative aide to Jackie Spear. My predecessor in Congress, when she was a state legislator, I worked for her as an aide. Did she give you any advice when you decided to run for this seat? Oh absolutely. There was no shortage of advice, thankfully, from Congresswoman Jackie Spear. She is an icon on the San Francisco Peninsula, given her 40 years of public life. She's got an incredible personal story. She is a household name to say the least. And frankly, it was surprising to everybody, frankly, when she announced her retirement. She suggested that I run. She had been watching me not only for my days as an aide to her, but as a state assembly member, state legislator in my own right, and she thought I was a worthy successor. So I decided to run and really what motivated me was democracy issues, elections, issues. I've been a lot of work on those issues in the California legislature and our democracy is hanging in the balance here in Washington DC and that's why I decided to run. But I have sought her counsel and will continue to do so as I get my footing here as a freshman in this big institution. Have you always been interested in politics and holding public office? Not always, although I am the product of some kitchen table conversations. My mother when I was growing up was a Republican. My father, a government teacher, is a civil rights era liberal. Government teacher believed in civic participation. So undoubtedly that rubbed off on me. And continue to be interested in civic matters, obviously, as I find myself here at the capital. But way back when I was a mobile DJ, I actually had the DJ nickname Cutmaster Keevy Keev if you can believe that wanted to be a club DJ, wanted to mix records and be a radio DJ. That didn't pan out. I found myself starting a small business and eventually finding my way into politics. But clearly, being the son of a government teacher who had the C-SPAN school bus, by the way, come to his classroom way back when certainly that rubbed off. It is part of my DNA. Mom, still a Republican? Always a Republican? My mom is no longer with us. She did, however, convert to become a Democrat during the Clinton era. She loved Bill Clinton and became a Democrat. So there was some unified democratic discussion from that point forward. Where do you trace your democratic roots to? Why are you a Democrat? Well, I believe in the role of government in helping people. Basically, public investment, I think, is crucial to building a better America. I think growing up in my father's household where civic engagement and the role of participating in one's government was so central. I think that really made me a Democrat. I think over time, I saw just the role that government can play in a positive way in people's lives. As we deal with these economic challenges, working people and lowering income individuals who need assistance from the government, I think that the civic participation piece is really at the core of why I'm a Democrat. Inclusive government, participation in government, participation in voting, lowering the barriers to participation in our democracy. That is all why I became a Democrat at 18 and I'm still a Democrat. Favorite artist? Music. Favorite music artist? Challenging question. To the former DJ. I'm so old school. I'm going to go back to my early DJ days and run DMC, which the younger staff here may not even know that reference. But I was when I began my DJ work as a mobile DJ, inspired by run DMC and some of the early hip hop that dates back to the 80s now. So that's before their generation. But we'll go with that one for right now. I would say more broadly, YouTube is my favorite band of all time and hope to see them. I think they're back out on the road pretty soon. So how look forward to seeing them.",

        "transcript": " This is Peninsula TV's coverage of the 47th annual Progress Seminar. The yearly event happened from April 8th through the 10th. The Redwood City, San Mateo County, Chamber of Commerce invited people from the county government, local business, and community leaders for a weekend retreat in Monterey to meet on community issues during keynote events and breakout sessions. The breakout sessions included Highway 101 corridor, ensuring our economic engine keeps moving, middle-class in transition from pickup trucks to Tesla's, connecting our communities, housing options for all, reflecting the community we serve. Our next generation steps up. But now on to coverage from the 2016 Progress Seminar. Well, good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everybody. Thank you. All right.

At this time, I'd like to thank our large alumni co-chair Rosanne Faust, Carol Grume, and Kevin Mullen for their hard work and fantastic job that they did and their committee did in putting together this year's program. Now I'd like to invite... Thank you. Now I would like to invite Rosanne up to the podium to start our program. Good morning, everyone. How are you feeling today? Are you ready to go through a fabulous day? Great breakouts? Good keynotes? Could we have kind of a San Mateo County? Woohoo! Come on. Woohoo! Okay. Well, we'll work on that for lunchtime because it was similar to when Kevin said, okay, thank the co-chairs. We did a lot of heavy lifting, but we couldn't have done it without the committee. So would the progress seminar committee members please stand up? Mom progress seminar committee members. I'm going to be perfectly frank. Without them, we couldn't put today's program on. So the three of us really thank them very much. And we thank Amy Buckmaster, Carolina Webster, and Nina Gann with the Chamber. Here... It was the Chamber's vision many years ago to begin this progress seminar. And it has continued for many, many years. What I'm going to do right now is I'm going to go through a rapid list of names.

So these are the folks that all the people who have come here many times before, please take a moment to engage them, to talk to them. I remember my first progress seminar 16 plus years ago. I didn't know a whole lot of people. And so when people came up and said hello, is this your first time, it made an impression. So really, I encourage you, please make them feel welcome, because we would like to see them come back. I'd also like to announce that 16, 16 of 20, San Mateo County cities are represented at this progress seminar. And I'm going to call out the leadership, so if the leadership of these cities can stand when your name is called, I'd really appreciate it.

We want to thank all of you for being here today for representing your city and being a part of the Progress Seminar. And our group of Chamber executives, events like this don't happen without partnerships. And my hack goes off to Amy Buckmaster and how her team has reached out to all the individual chambers in San Mateo County to make sure that they're here today and have the ability to come and really be a part of it. So I'm going to announce the Chamber executives if we could give them a rousing welcome as well. Cheryl Angeles, San Mateo Chamber, Dave Bouchard, San Carlos Chamber, Amy Buckmaster, Redwood City Chamber, Mitch Bull, Brisbane Chamber, Frandine Menlo Park Chamber, Maria Martin, Nuchy, South San Francisco Chamber, Jamie Monazan, San Bruno Chamber, George Etnailer, Burlingame Chamber, Cherice McQ, Half Moon Bay Chamber, and Lorianne Richardson, Millbury Chamber. Let's give them all a hand. We laugh when we as co-chairs break up who does what? I grew up in New York and I talk fast, which is why I got that assignment to read everyone's names. So it works. Now I'm going to bring up our beloved supervisor of San Mateo County, Carol Groom, who will introduce our first speaker this morning. Come on folks, let's welcome Carol. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Okay, I got a little bit better than Rosanne there. It's my real honor this morning to introduce to you. Really needs no introduction. Supervisor Warren's lokom. He was elected to the Board of Supervisors in November of 2012. He represents the fourth district, which includes East Palo Alto, East Menlo Park, Redwood City, and the unincorporated community of North Fair Oaks. He has a deep passion for public service and for over 20 years he has worked hard to improve the quality of life for the people on the peninsula. You all remember when he was the chief election officer? Went to Bosnia? Went to Bosnia to show them how to vote. Show them about democracy. So he is focused on the issues of housing, youth, and veterans. In fact, one of his most recent accomplishments was the creation of the San Mateo County Veterans Task Force. He's committed to the, committed and focused to the issues of housing. He and Don Horsley are chairing our countywide housing task force. He is a Vietnam vet, earned his degree from San Diego State University on the GI Bill. He's proud to have served as an election officer in Albania. He and his wife Maria Diaz Slocum, a Redwood City school district trustee and family call Redwood City Home. He's a technology enthusiast, got every piece of equipment there is. An amateur photographer. He calls himself a hack golfer, but he's pretty good. He loves the outdoors, he loves dogs, he's always looking for a great cup of coffee. And I just want to add one personal comment. He is a great, great colleague, deeply committed to the people of this county. Great supervisor, please welcome Warren Slocum. Carol thank you for that great introduction. I want to ask your indulgence for just a moment because I'm going to go off script a little bit here already. You know how elect is Don Horsley here, I thought I saw him walk in. He's over here. You know how elected officials have these catchy little tag lines for their community meetings. You all know about those right? It's like donuts with Don. Java with Jerry. Coffee with Kevin. What is that? We've all. So stay with me now. So not to be outdone, my very able staff came up with an idea. It's called selfies with Slocum. And if you went to the district for office, you would see a little thread with all these little like member Polaroid cameras. Well they have a little attachment now for the iPhone where you can take a picture in print like a small Polaroid picture. Did you know that? And so what we do is when we go to community events and North Ferro's community festival, whatever it is, we do selfies with Slocum. And then we have little close pins and we put them up on the line outside the office. And as people are coming in to see a supervisor or Mr. Malkyre, Mike Calligay, or whoever it is, they stop and they look at these pictures. And it always brings a smile to their face. So right now, we together, you this beautiful audience and I, are going to do a selfie with Slocum. Okay, here we go. Everybody, smile. Here we go. Thank you. Just one other thing since one cell is ours here. I just want to tell you about a new Facebook application called Live where on your Facebook application, you can actually stream video live. So I'm just kidding one. First let me start by saying that the state of the county is stronger than ever. Yeah. And we're working hard on regional issues in a collaborative way. And I think from my perspective, it can be said that we are tackling some of the most biggest challenges of our generation head on. So Jerry Seinfeld said, everybody remembers Jerry Seinfeld, right? Jerry Seinfeld said, quote, I am so busy doing nothing that the idea of doing anything, which as you know, always leads to something, cuts into the nothing, and then forces me to have to drop everything. So hopefully, hopefully, all of us have dropped everything given the opportunity to gather here in Monterey and learn new things and strengthen the ties that bind us all here in this room. And of course, Monterey, Monterey, California is one of the most beautiful places on the West Coast, right? Right behind San Mateo County. Thank you to Amy Buckmaster, President and CEO of the Redwood City Chamber and all the chambers and organizations in San Mateo County that are co-hosting this year's Progress Seminar. Also thanks to event co-chairs, Kevin Mullen, Rosanne Faust, and my dear colleague, Supervisor Carol Grum, and to the committee and staff that worked so hard to make this year's event come together. It's an incredible undertaking to gather this many people and have an organized program. So let's give it up for all of them. It's a privilege, it's a privilege as President of San Mateo County Board of Supervisors to present this time-honored tradition of the state of the county update. And before I do that, let me just take a moment to give some context to what follows. We're all witness to the changes around us in demographics, in income, in housing prices, the mix of businesses in our area. And yes, even our skylines. Life on the peninsula is very different even from just five years ago. We are in the midst of this profound transformation that's going on all around us. Our mix of cultures, language, food, tradition makes us very diverse. Our immigrant population, listen to this, this is hard to believe, but listen. Our immigrant population has grown at a faster rate than most other counties in California. We are the fourth fastest growing immigrant population here in San Mateo County of any county in California. That's pretty amazing, isn't it? And basically, as you drive around, you see all these help wanted signs. The unemployment rate on the peninsula is among the lowest in the state at around 3%. That's pretty incredible, isn't it? 3%. Personal income has increased to nearly 90,000 per capita. In our area, tracks more visitors than ever before. Last year, for instance, 50, 50, that's 50,000,000 passengers passed through SFO. The airport had the highest rate of international visitors of any American airport in 2015. Now I thought I saw Dave Pine earlier. Is he here? There he is, over there. So, in preparing for this talk this morning, I actually went back and there are videos online if you're interested. You can watch keynote addresses from prior years. And just to get a little suggestion and hint, I actually watched Dave Pine's presentation to you all a couple of years ago. And regarding the airport and the large, huge number of visitors to the airport, he commented in what I hope was a lighter moment that most of those visitors were probably going to the PES museum in Berlin game. And Dave, I'm sorry, but that's just not the case. He really did say that, by the way. The median home price in December of 2015 was $925,000, up nearly 15% over the prior year. In 2010, the property tax roll was $141 billion. Today, it's $177 billion. And as we all know, the demand for office space in all of our cities has just gone on unchecked. I mean, there's building going on. It seems like everywhere in San Mateo County. So that's a brief snapshot of the strength of our local economy. But what about the strength of our county government? And I believe you can measure that strength by asking and answering four questions. The first one is how safe are our communities? Next, how well are we providing for the health and well-being of the most vulnerable among us? How well do we collaborate with partners to effectively serve all the people of the county? And finally, the county manager will like this one. How well are the county's finances being managed? So let's go back and answer some of those questions. First, how safe are we in San Mateo County? And we're very fortunate. San Mateo County is one of the safest urban counties in the state. Violent and property crime have decreased by 27% and 21% respectively since 2000. This is an important statistic. Our recidivism rate is 24%. Compared to the state's average of 61%. How about that? So maybe we should give it up for Sheriff Mugs and all the police agencies in San Mateo County and all the cities for the work that they do. In March, we celebrated the ribbon cutting of the Maple Street Correctional Facility in Ridwood City. It's not a temporary warehouse with a revolving door for people who've committed crimes. But rather, it's a facility designed to provide an array of services to inmates who earn the right to develop themselves and establish a new course for their lives. Programs like the Choices Reentry Program, Culinary Training Program, Computer Classes, ED classes, art therapy, and other programs in that facility will be made available to inmates. So we should thank Sheriff Greg Mugs and under Sheriff Carlos Blanas. But especially we need to thank my colleague, Supervisor Adrian Tissier, for there and especially her incredible vision on this topic. It's taken 11 years, 11 years of hard work and an on wavering commitment despite opposition and on certain economic times to get that facility constructed. And I think it was on March 19th that the first women actually, I believe, started to populate that facility, leaving it dilapidated just horrible women's jail for this new facility. So to Adrian Tissier, who unfortunately couldn't be here, we just want to say a big thank you for her work. And something that will bring a smile to the county manager's face and to city managers all across the county. This project was done on time and within budget. So next question, what does the health and well-being picture look like for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable among us? Well, honestly, it's a mixed picture. On the positive side, San Mateo County is one of the most successful counties in the state in assisting people to sign up under covered California, the state's health insurance exchange. Our uninsured population has declined from 30% to 9% in just two years. And all of our children, all of the children in San Mateo County are covered by the Healthy Kids program or by private insurance. And that was the Healthy Kids initiative was an initiative started by your board of supervisors. So thank you, supervisor Grumman, everybody else that had a hand in that. Many mental health programs that were cut back during the great recession have been restored and new programs have been added. Last year, measure $8 helped fund a startup called the California Clubhouse, which is a very successful program for adults, which focuses on actual work. It's a very interesting program and we're proud to have contributed to that. We also expanded the smart teams that provide crisis intervention and respite care for the mentally ill. And we voted unanimously to implement Laura's law adding to the toolkit of strategies to prevent needless tragedies. While the number of people with access to health care has grown, the most vulnerable in San Mateo County are frankly being squeezed out of the local housing market due to the economic vitality of our region and the lack of housing at all levels, not just affordable, but all levels. There are five numbers that some of you who are on the closing the jobs housing task force have heard before, please forgive me, but they're worth repeating. Here they are. Between the years of 2010 and 2014, four years, 55,000 new jobs were added here, 55,000. In that same period of time, there were 2200 new housing units added. So you wonder about that jobs housing gap. There it is. It was 20 million square feet of office space added to the inventory. Around $3,000 is the rent of one of those new apartments in Redwood City. And that goes through throughout the county. And $53 an hour is the salary a person needs, $53 an hour is the salary a person needs to maintain a housing cost burden of 30%. This is a problem for the entire county and for all of its cities and employers. It threatens the diversity of our communities, the vitality of our businesses, and erodes frankly our quality of life. Just two significant reminders if I could. We all travel on highway one at one or two 80 and surface streets like Al Camino Real through Menlo Park, for instance, no offense rate. But we all know, we all know this fact that traffic is bad. And it used to be in the good old days that you could get on one on one during the day and not be bumper to bumper. Pretty much anymore it's crowded. The other reminder is that many service workers, especially our teachers, public sector workers, are having to move further and further away in search of an affordable place to live. So 20% of our people are struggling to get by working two and three jobs just to pay the rent and put food on the table. The good news is that today the county has allocated a lot of money. In fact 19.1 million for the creation of 603 housing units to support families, veterans, seniors and the very low income, as well as the mentally ill. We've allocated three million and affordable housing funds for 300 homeless shelter beds. And another 7.8 million distributed later this year. I'm very proud to have worked with Don Horsley and others on the board where we actually, we didn't, but coer builders did, built a veterans homeless housing unit in the city of Menlo Park. Menlo Park put up a lot of money, the county put up some money. And that project opened recently, in fact in January. And it now houses 60 veterans who otherwise would have been homeless. How's that? In March, just last month, the University Avenue Senior Housing Project broke ground. That development will add 41 units for seniors in East Palo Alto. And later this month, the Sequoia Bell Haven Project will break ground, adding 90 affordable apartments for seniors in Menlo Park. So lots and lots of work has been done. There is a lot of work that's currently underway, but we all know that there's a lot of work that lies ahead of us all. So the next question is, how well do we collaborate with the partners to serve the residents of this county? Well, let me illustrate this point if I could by shining a light on the work of my colleagues. But first, as a new supervisor, let me just say that people always ask me, everywhere I go, people ask me this question, what's it really like to work with Supervisor Carol Grume? What's it really like to work with Supervisor Dave Pine, Don Horsley, and Adrian? What's that really like? What can guys do back there? And if you're sitting at Horsley's table, I'm sure he's getting a little nervous right now because I'm... So I'm going to give it to you just absolutely straight. Okay? I pride myself on honesty, and I'm going to give it to you straight. Bottom line is that my colleagues are an amazing group of elected officials, and each one of us is different from the other. And together, I think it's a collegial environment most of the time. And I think we do amazing work, and that's a credit to each and every one of those Supervisors and let me just say how proud I am to serve with you all. I'm not going to reveal any secrets. Now, Supervisor Dave Pine. Of course we all know that he's taken on the urgent issue of sea level rise. He's a leader in creating a planning template to address this issue. You might not know, but Dave is spearheading a nine county effort aimed at bay restoration. It's a historic nine county ballot measure. He's leading that. Supervisors Pine and Grume, as you all probably know, are leading the Peninsula Clean Energy Project, which strives to deliver cleaner, greener energy options to local residents at competitive rates. And the group ought to be very proud because every city in the county has signed on to that initiative. Thank you. Supervisor Carol Grume, you all know that she's a champion for our kids. She's a champion for our kids. And the past couple of progress seminars you've heard about the big lift, which is an initiative to ensure the future success of our children by increasing reading proficiency from 50% to 80% by the time those students enter the fourth grade. What an ambitious undertaking. What's new this year and unique is that the summer learning program at our libraries is being focused on entering first graders, starting that important reading intervention so much earlier. Thank you, Supervisor Grume, for your leadership. Supervisor Don Horzley and I have the opportunity to golf yesterday. I'm very pleased to report that I beat Don. But we are co-chairing the closing the jobs, housing task force. In addition, he has tackled really important farm labor housing initiatives for low income workers on the coast and their families. And as our coastal representative, Don's worked very hard to save surfer beach on highway 1 from collapse as the erosion there on that embankment supporting highway 1 reached a rate of about 1.5 feet per year. So highway 1 was going to fall off into the ocean. Thank you, Supervisor Horzley, for your leadership on that issue and others. And Supervisor Ada and Tissley A, in addition to seeing the work completed on that 11-year project, has also coordinated the law enforcement community and schools community to establish the coalition for safe schools and communities. And that group was formed after the beyond new town, countywide convening with the goal, with the goal of keeping our kids safe at school. So finally, what about the financial health of this county? Well, it's very strong. We're one of the three counties in the state to earn a triple A credit rating from both Moody's and Standard Imports. We've reduced unfunded pension and retiree health liabilities. Right now the retirement system is more than 85% funded and we expect it to be fully funded within five years. And we're maintaining a general fund reserve of around 20% of budget, which is pretty amazing. Measure A, the voter approved half-scent sales tax measure, is making it possible to build for San Mateo County and the cities. A new public safety dispatch and emergency operations center. New fire stations. A new mental health facility out at Cordelleras. And several library improvement projects. And a lot more that there just isn't time to mention. But thanks to the voters of San Mateo County who approved measure A. So I hope you can see that our communities are safe. Our financial position is strong that we take care of the less fortunate and we collaborate with anybody who's interested in solving real problems. Someone once said there's nothing more intoxicating than big bold things. And as we think about what kind of future all of us are trying to build here, I'd like to leave you with three, what I think are bold initiatives that I invite you to consider. First, as I mentioned, affordable housing is on everybody's radar. It's a crisis. We've taken important steps to address this issue. But what if cities in San Mateo County joined together, created an affordable housing impact fee and agreed to share a portion of their individual fees with an organization like Heart, which is a JPA that provides early seed money for affordable housing projects. If we did that, if we could do that together, it would generate millions and millions of dollars for affordable housing projects that Heart could loan out as early seed money to get those things off the ground. Okay, so I mentioned traffic. Traffic is on everybody's radar. It's a problem. I know there's a panel today on transportation, which should be very interesting. What if we opened the Dumbarton Rail Corridor? That runs from East Palo Alto up to Redwood City. Has some kind of a light rail system, if you can imagine that, and connected to the North South Caltrain system. This would get a significant number of people off our congested roads and would yield a cleaner environment. I know this project has been around for years and years and years, and everybody says, oh, there's no way Steve Reviser, that's going to happen. But what if we could do that? That would be amazing. And finally, as joint venture Silicon Valley has said, a world-class wireless network is one of the keys to robust economic development throughout this region. And right now, the network that exists, especially in San Mateo County, is anything but world class. There are dead spots, dead zones, lots and lots of families do not have internet access. And that really shouldn't be the case in the innovation center of the world. Our businesses, schools, families, nonprofits, and our kids who rely on the network to do homework, to do learning, to do reading, deserve a future. They deserve a future where everybody has world-class access to the network period. So go ahead. Thank you. And as leaders, we make choices every day. We make choices every day through our action or inaction. I'm not going to make a crack about Washington there. Every day as leaders, we make choices through our actions or inaction. I think we've chosen action and the state of our county is strong because of it. Now, I'm going to close with an old African proverb that we should be reminded of from time to time. It says, if you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together. Surely, our destiny will depend on how many of us choose to join forces and confront the challenges of our time. And that's exactly why we're here. Thank you all for your attention. Enjoy it. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you so much, Supervisor Slokum, for setting the tone for the day today. I'm Assemblymember Kevin Mullen. And I'm excited to hear our next speaker because he's going to be talking about issues directly relevant to the challenges that we face as policymakers at all level levels in San Mateo County. And the private sector as well. So I am very pleased to bring to the podium David Grooski. David is the Barbara Kimble Browning Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences, director of the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality and Co-Editor of Pathways Magazine. His research addresses the changing nature of late industrial inequality. And addresses such topics as the role of rent, seeking, and market failure and explaining the takeoff and income inequality. The amount of economic and social mobility in the US and other high inequality countries with a particular focus on the great Gatsby hypothesis that opportunities for social mobility are declining. I'm interested to hear more about that. The role of essentialism in explaining the persistence of extreme gender inequality. The forces behind recent changes in the amount of face to face and online cross class contact and the putative decline of big social classes. He is also involved in projects to improve the countries infrastructure for monitoring poverty inequality and mobility by exploiting administrative and other forms of big data more aggressively. This is a little heavy for 845 in the morning, but I think we'll be able to manage it. His recent books include Social Stratification, 2014, Occupy the Future, another book called The New Guilded Age, another one called The Great Recession. He's a busy guy. The inequality reader as well as the inequality puzzle. Please join me in welcoming Dr. David Gursky. Thank you. Well, thanks for such a kind introduction. It's a real honor and pleasure to be here. I'm going to get right to it. I want to talk about how we might go about reducing poverty in a substantial way. California is, as probably most of you know, not just the land of plenty. It is, of course, that, but it's also, unfortunately, the land of poverty. If you measure poverty with the countries, what many think is the country's premier measure of poverty, a supplemental poverty measure, we rank dead last with more than one in five in the state in poverty. Dead last. And you might ask, we're a can-do state, right? We're a progressive state. When we see a big problem, we tend to take it on and do pretty amazing things. And there's a lot that we can be proud of in this state. But you might then wonder why this is a pretty big problem. And yet, for all that we've done, and we've done amazing things in this state, we have a new earned income tax credit. We have a minimum wage movement, this very robust. You just heard about a lot of very, very important initiatives underway more locally. We've done a lot of good things, but this is a big, big problem. And you might ask, why haven't we done even more? And I think there are a lot of reasons. There are a lot of reasons, but I want to proper one, just one that I think is part of the answer as to why we haven't taken on this big problem in a big way. And I think it's what I call the two complicated narrative. And it says that it's a problem that we just don't fully understand. And that the best we can do when we have problems that we don't fully understand, when we have problems that are really complicated, the best that we can do is more research, which is great for someone doing research with a full employment policy. But I'm not sure as good as it is for scholars to have that approach, I don't think it's actually on the mark. And I think, in fact, we already know a lot about poverty. We know about the sources of poverty. They're in fact not all that complicated as much as academics try to complicate it up, but it's not all that complicated. And I'd say we've gotten it a bit wrong in that what's complicated is the consequences of poverty, but not the causes. So I want to give you what I call the pollution metaphor to lay out that argument. I hope more clearly. And so this, I want you to suppose that there's a mill that's upstream and that unfortunately it's putting into the stream adjacent to the mill. It's putting some pollutants into the water. There's this downstream city, let's suppose, that's suffering by virtue of that pollution, suffering all sorts of health problems. It may be cognitive dysfunction, asthma, depression, and on and on. Okay, and so we take what I would call a downstream approach typically when we have health problems of that sort. Namely, we treat the consequences of the pollution. So we'll hire epidemiologists to ensure that indeed there's a statistical correlation between the source and the health problems downstream. We'll have physicians and clinicians, lots of them treating those health problems, instructing the population about how they should deal with them. We have special education teachers that are dealing with the cognitive dysfunction that arises by virtue of the pollution. We have social workers dispersing all the benefits that are necessary because lots of folks can't now work by virtue of these health problems. We have police officers and prison guards now being hired in ever hiring numbers to deal with the fraying social fabric as more and more folks can't work. That's the downstream approach. It's really complicated, right? There's a lot of things you have to do by virtue of these health problems. Now, of course, if you don't like that downstream approach, there's another way to go. And that would be the upstream approach and just end the pollution. So I would argue that that's a useful metaphor for understanding how we take on poverty as well. So what do we do? Well, we treat all the symptoms of poverty. And that's a complicated job, right? We hire social scientists, again, a full employment policy for us to track the many and multifarious consequences of poverty. And there are lots. So we lay them out in paper after paper. We hire nurses and physicians to deal with all the health problems. And there are many that arise by virtue of poverty. We hire social workers to disperse benefits and otherwise handle the multifarious problems that arise because of poverty. We, of course, hire police officers and prison guards because we have to be honest about it. One of our main poverty policies is warehousing the board. And so there's a lot of work to be done on that front, too. So if you don't like those downstream approach, there is, again, an alternative. And it's the upstream one. And that's to repair the institutions that are creating all this poverty. So I want to lay out an ambitious agenda about how you might actually do that. And so I want to talk about this upstream approach. And I think we know in general terms what's to be done. But the devil here, as always, is in the details. And so I want to lay out some of those details. And if we're going to really get serious about taking on poverty, and I think we should, we've got to get it right. You don't get the opportunities to do this too often. About half century ago, we had a war on poverty. Many people think I would argue wrongly, but think it was a failed war. And it took a long time for us to even contemplate the possibility of undertaking another full on war. I think the time is right to do that now. But we've got to do it. We've got to get it right. So I want to think a bit about how you might indeed take on poverty. If you wanted a full-throated upstream approach to poverty, what might you do? And so there's a little bit of a backdrop then that I think you have to immediately recognize and appreciate if you want this full-throated war on poverty. There are two forces at work. And we've been talking about them already today. One is rising income inequality. Everyone knows about that, right? We see it here up front and close. But there's another, so I'm not going to talk about that force. But it's a backdrop that we have to take on if we're thinking about how to reduce poverty substantially. But the other force that I don't think is as well appreciated is rising commodification. And it's really these two forces operating together that give rising inequality its teeth. So let me lay out what I mean by that. So first, what do I mean by rising commodification? Well, there are two ways that goods and services can be distributed. One way we all know that is use the market, right? So if you have the resources, the money, you buy those goods and services, right? The other way, though, is that they're just seen as a prerogative of group membership. That everyone universally is given those goods and services. And we allocate them to members of that group automatically. And by rising commodification, I mean that it's that first approach using the market to allocate goods and services that's increasingly commonly used. So you need the money to buy goods, services, and even opportunity. OK? So let me give you a really simple example, an example about which no one would care in and of itself, but makes it clear what I'm talking about. So when you buy a plane ticket, you become a member of a club, let's say, United Club, American Club, Delta Club, right? Your club member for a bit. And it was once the case that once you're in that club, you would get a lot of public goods. You'd get some things automatically by virtue, just by virtue of being a member of that club. You'd get a movie. You'd get a meal. You'd get a snack. You'd get checked luggage privileges, right? Now, if you want those things, money on the table, right? So what was once the public good, you're going to have got to pay for them. That's the decline of public goods through this simple example. But there's another force at work, what I would call the decline of public lottery. So it used to be the case that you could get a bulkhead seat or an exit row seat just by lucky, just by luck. That you could log on a bit earlier than others and just get it or you'd line up earlier and get it. And by luck alone, you'd get those seats. Now, of course, if you want the bulkhead seat or if you want the exit row seat, what do you do? Money on the table. OK, so no one cares about that example, except when you're flying. But I think it's a, it's, it demonstrate what's going on more, more broadly. And so I want to talk about just two examples of the decline of public goods and how it affects people who are poor and the decline of public lottery. So let's start with public goods. Just one example, but an important one. I don't know much time. But it used to be that just by virtue of being born, you would have access, by and large, to loving child care from your mother. That was just a public good. You're born? You get that. Now, of course, we have a two-erinder family and that's wonderful and great, but let's just think about what that means for poor people. If you want high quality child care, it's not just automatically provided by your loving mother. You have to, you have to buy it. You have to put money on the table. Easy for those who are well off to do that. You just buy your high quality child care. You've got the money to do that. But if you're poor, this is difficult, right? And we know that high quality early childhood has immense implications for, for, for down the road productivity. And so if you don't have access to it, if you don't have the money to put on the table, that's a problem. So that's the decline of public goods. It's just one example, but a, but an important one. What about public lottery? Well, it used to be the case, if you, in like say, 75 years ago, if you were poor, you could actually rent an apartment in a city like Palo Alto. And, and that's like winning the neighborhood lottery, right? Because now your kids would have access to those wonderful Palo Alto public schools, and have all the opportunity that's been afforded to them by virtue of that. Now if you're poor, of course you're locked out of Palo Alto, you're locked out of those high-ventity neighborhoods. And that's a general phenomenon across the US, across California. Poor people are increasingly living with other poor people, and rich people are living with rich people. And that means poor people are locked out of neighborhoods that provide those amenities like high quality public schooling that make it possible for their children to do well. So that's the decline of public lottery. There's no neighborhood lottery anymore, rich, live with rich, poor, live with poor, and that's consequential. Okay, so what do you do? If I operate, so what I'm basically laid out is that opportunity has to now be bought. If you're poor, it's not just that you have less money than the well-off, that's rising income inequality. But it also is the case that you need money increasingly to buy opportunity for your kids. You need money to buy high quality childcare, and that generates opportunity for your kids. You need money to get into high-ventity neighborhoods that allow for high-quality public schooling for your kids. Opportunities for sale. You need money now as a poor person. So then, then was the case in the past, you need money to buy that opportunity for your kids. So, so that's the backdrop. What do you do? So we live in this highly commodified world. Poor people are disadvantaged in two ways now. They have less money than the well-off in relative terms, and they need money more than was the case in the past to buy opportunity for their kids. What do you do? Well, one option is to acquiesce to commodification, if I can put it in scholarly speak, and just transfer money to the poor. You say, okay, look, opportunities for sale, that's where we are, fine. We do commit as a country to providing opportunity to everyone. We think that's very important. And hence, let's provide the poor with the money that they need so that they can buy opportunity for their kids. So that would just be a transfer program. This is, for example, what Tony Blair did in the UK very aggressively. He reduced poverty. But how long did the Blair program last? As long as Blair lasted. And now it's being dismantled. So it was a politically contentious solution to carry out a lot of transfer. Right? So option two, which I think is politically more viable in a country like the US and the UK that has certain sensibilities about these things, is politically more viable to de-commonify, to directly provide opportunities in those junctures where the poor don't have access to them. So I'm going to lay out how you might do that very quickly. I'm almost done. So what you want to do is identify those places where poor children don't have the same opportunities as children born into well-off families have. You identify where that is and they need to deliver directly those opportunities. And so the idea is that in this country, we're committed to the principle that all children, no matter how rich or poor their parents may be, all children should have access to opportunities. Let's figure out where it is that we're not living up to that commitment and deliver those opportunities. And so the idea is that, yeah, the market's wonderful in delivering goods and services as a wonderful mechanism, except when it comes to opportunity. There we think everyone should have it. All kids should have it. Not just those who are lucky enough to be born into rich families, but all kids. And so if we're not living up to that commitment, let's do it. If you're going to be using taxpayer money for this, and I think you're going to have to, you have to make sure that whenever you spend that money, you do it with programs that have been proven to deliver results. So you might say by contrast, the rich can spend promiscuously on their children, European vacation, no problem, finishing school vacation, do it. Maybe it'll have payoff, you're not sure. But you got the money to do it. And so of course, as a parent, you want to do it. But if you're using taxpayer money, you've got to be absolutely sure that any intervention that you undertake is going to be a high payoff one. And so the goal would be to identify, as I'll very quickly go through here, those interventions for which the evidence base is irrefutable. So let's start off with home visiting programs. Basically, the objective here is to equalize information about how to raise children in healthy ways, deliver information about raising children at both prenatal and postnatal stages. The home visiting program has been shown to be very effective. It's just an information intervention. You're just providing information to folks so that they can carry those healthy practices in a way that have been shown to deliver. Very effective program. Equalizes capacities. Because we know that these types of practices, when played out, generate healthier kids. Equalized capacities can have a profound effect at reducing poverty. But then you got to hand off. That's one way in which opportunities are equalized. But the next way is that early training has to be provided to families that can't afford to put the money on the table. So you directly provide early childhood education to poor children. Because again, been shown that when you do so in a high quality way, immense payoff. And then there are a whole host of later interventions that you can undertake that have been shown to be low cost and high pay off. So I'm going to give you just one example. It's one that's been put out by my colleague, Carolyn Hockspy. What she's shown is that a lot of poor kids don't apply to colleges that line up well with their with their talents and capacities. They may have a high GPA, very high test scores. But they're not applying to the right types of colleges, the kinds of colleges that will really exploit their talents. If you just provide information to poor kids using social media, for example, provide information, text messaging, provide information to those kids, saying, you know, actually if you apply to Stanford, you'd get in and you'd get a free ride. That kind of intervention can be immensely productive. Simple information intervention. What are you doing? You're actually overcoming neighborhood segregation, right? Poor kids don't have access to that kind of information because they're growing up typically with other poor kids who just don't know what kind of colleges for which they might qualify. Well off kids get that just organically in their neighborhoods by running into other kids who know that information. But you can create an artificial neighborhood through say text messaging where you deliver that information. It's on the cheek. Of course, we'd love to live in integrated neighborhoods before we get there. This is one, one cheap way to deliver some of the benefits of an integrated neighborhood without actually integrating. So there's a plan out there actually. If you want to learn more about it, it's a Stanford Equal Opportunity Plan that pieces together these interventions that have been shown to work that will level the playing field. I hope it'll someday be initiative on the California ballot, maybe 2018. Why do I think if it were an initiative, it might actually garner support. First off, it's politically viable. It avoids cash transfers in favor of directly providing services. And we've actually focused group this throughout the state. People are okay with that. They like that approach. Cash transfer, a bit of a problem, direct provision of opportunities. They're all on board. It's consistent with our values. It's all about equalizing opportunity, which is one of our fundamental values, right? We think that kids, no matter how poor their parents may be, should have opportunities. Let's make sure that happens. We've done the simulations that show that if we make these kinds of interventions in an aggressive, full-throated way, we'll substantially reduce poverty. Why? Because we're treating it at the right scale. Most of our program's are way too small, given the magnitude of the problem. Next, it'll be a permanent reduction in poverty, because we're treating it at the source. This is an upstream approach, a permanent reduction in poverty. We always want to end poverty tomorrow, right? And so we have a lot of quick fixes, magic bullets, small programs, flavor of the day programs, because we want to do it tomorrow. It's not going to be tomorrow. It's going to take 20 years. But if we do it, if we commit to that now, in 20 years, we can solve this problem. And that would be an extraordinary thing. And we could do it in California, be a leader again. It would be an economy-growing reform. Why? We're increasing human capital investments. We would better fulfill California's natural niche, which is a high-skill niche. Like the labor force more productive. And we would save money in the end, because our spending on safety net programs would dramatically drop. So that's it. Let's do it. Thank you.

        "transcript": " Hi, I'm Assembly Speaker, Pro Tem, Kevin Mullin, and I'm proud to represent San Mateo County in the California State Assembly. Welcome to another edition of Capital Connection, my video message series, designed to keep my constituents updated on what's happening at the state capital. I'm happy to report that the 2017-18 legislative session is often running. When Governor Brown delivered his state-of-the-state address in January, he urged both houses of legislature to continue working together for all Californians. Over the past six years we have increased support for public schools, increased the minimum wage, served as a world leader in climate change while also closing a massive budget deficit and creating a rainy day fund. Our most recent accomplishment was the passage of SB1, the comprehensive long overdue transportation package that will provide much needed investments in roadways and public transit throughout California. Our transportation infrastructure already had many glaring needs and this winter's heavy rain exposed even more fragile roadways and desperate need of repair. I know San Mateo County residents experienced the deterioration of our roads firsthand and given the work I have done over the past two years to address the poor conditions on Highway 101, I am pleased to let you know that SB1 includes $300 million to address this important stretch of roadway. Passing the transportation package was a major achievement however we still have many pressing issues before us. The 2017-18 budget must be adopted by June 15th. The governor's proposed budget is a generally prudent approach and anticipates declining revenue projections in California based on the unknown economic impact that may result from potential changes in the amount of federal funding under the Trump administration. In spite of these uncertainties we absolutely must find a way to make affordable housing available, particularly workforce housing. So more Californians can live closer to where they work. Our housing crisis continues to spiral at a time when workforce housing is needed most to maintain our economic growth. I am proud to be working with Assembly member David Chu and other legislative colleagues to craft the affordable housing legislation that makes sense and addresses this critical issue. As a member of the budget committee I look forward to working with my assembly and Senate colleagues to build on the governor's budget proposal and craft a sustainable budget with growing out-year reserves and smart investments to strengthen the middle class, reduce poverty and fulfill the promise of access to quality medical care. My legislative package includes a total of 23 bills which focus on the following areas. Elections, social equity, transportation and the innovation economy. I look forward to sharing more details with you in the next edition of Capital Connection. You can also obtain more information on my full legislative package by visiting my website and following me on Facebook. I hope you've enjoyed this edition of Capital Connection. I'd like to invite residents of San Mateo County to contact me by visiting my website and clicking on the contact Kevin button or calling my office with suggestions or feedback. It is an honor to represent you in the California State Assembly and thank you for watching.",

        "transcript": " My conduct is played courage in overcoming one of the darkest chapters in American history, the internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans. He built a Normanena's legacy to say never again, Mr. Hanukkah stood up for the rights of Arab Americans, Iranian Americans, Chinese Americans, Korean Americans, and transgender Americans even when it was not popular. I plan to reach out to him, extend friendship and respect, and I hope you will continue to be an active and strong voice on these issues. But the son of Indian immigrants could run against the survivor of Japanese internment, shows just how far America has come. I don't think my parents could have ever imagined it. Where are my parents? I don't think they would have imagined it. When they first stood in line at JFK Airport waiting to have their passport stamped. I don't think they would have imagined it when they took the oath of office, the oath of citizenship. Only in America can the middle-class son of a schoolteacher and a chemical engineer who came to this country with no money grow up to represent the most powerful economic district in the world. You see both my parents and Rithus parents. Where are Rithus parents? There they are. Let's get them around the world. I want them to share their belief in this country's fundamental decency. They raised us to believe that in America anything is possible. I personally say Rithu married me as an example. Their story is the story of a community that will now add its voice to the American course. We are trying out to the Bay Area, California and to our nation. Here in Silicon Valley we have new communities that have something to offer, new activists who want to give that new-dom voices who want to answer the call to service. we did not see to diminish the past. What we sought to do is prepare for the future. We believe that in time and software is transforming every industry, when workers are competing against machines, our nation desperately needs stronger leadership from this region. We need new solutions for how to create jobs in the face of automation. We need to make educating our workforce in a global economy the highest priority of government. We need to figure out how to lift up those with a technology revolution as left behind. And we need to make the case that having the best and brightest from around the world makes us stronger, not weaker. I am very hopeful of the future, no matter which side of the national election you may have been on. I believe years from now when people will look at this room, take a look at the folks across this room, they will say, I wince the future of America. I wince the future of the first nation in history that has people from every part of the globe bound by a commitment to build an order just and peaceful world. Is that not a brilliant future? Think about it after centuries of wars, assassinations, coups, interments, colonial overreach to think that a new America will lead a new century of peace, a century of innovation, a century of understanding. My friends, I know our journey has been long to get here, but our work is just beginning. Let us come together rising above the divisions abouled by a sense of purpose and possibility to renew our faith in the great American political experiment so that we might achieve that elusive dream while linking prophesies as a just and lasting case among ourselves and with all nations. It has been a great campaign in Jordan. Thank you. I now want to thank some folks. I want to thank everyone. People at Berkeley do this, say, you're so boring. When you start thanking everyone going on and on, and then you all know that I believe this is some people. I know you will. I'm here as long as you're here to meet afterwards, but I didn't want to single some folks out. Of course, my wife. People say what's the difference between last campaign and this campaign, and I say, let go. And she's just been extraordinary. I think sometimes you don't realize how difficult it is to partner the running for office as being by someone's side when they run for office. And she's picked me up at my lowest moments and encouraged me at the highest moments. And I'm deeply grateful and proud of her. I'm a family. My parents, big gay and jokes, I kind of, my brother. I'm proud of coming up more, and I'm not going to miss. I'm so honored to have Riffus Karen here, Monti and Wuchau, who to thank you for all the years. Of course, people of this place need no introduction to Steve Spinner, who has given. For four years, throughout his life, tired of his life as he reminds me for this campaign, selflessly, and his kids are here, wonderful to see you see. This is a no-word. I get jotted these notes in coming. I wanted to recognize our extraordinary team and paying team, Michael Amler. Like, oh! Kevin Sam, Eddie, Gary, Chris, my mom. They were the heart and soul. 40,000 doors. They were amazing. Let's give them another round of applause. I want to say, please bear with me, just a few more minutes. Josh Allen, I saw John. John's been wonderful with jokes. I've been visiting this old man, and I went in David Berger, if he's here to recognize them for their leadership. I see Fallet and Kamal, where my journey began 10 years ago at their home. The name is David and he's extraordinary, and he can jog each other, who is there in every step. And Rahul Roy, who was chair and brought together everyone in three months, so that we had to bring people and succeed. And our vice chairs, Frank Paschravi, Rusty, Rusty's always tweeting. Rusty room. Frank Paschravi is an idol of the Gwani here on all, is an amazing person. And Michal Gromor, wherever Michal is, has just given his life also to this campaign. Thank you, Michal. I see a great shot from this day. Thank you, Michal, for the very early fights. And Maye Shabrina. Thank you, Maye Shabrina for everything you've done. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Pickles will organize this event. Let's give him a round of applause. Jopin' out on the floor.",

I'm astounded at how many people are here and how many people are interested in this campaign So we really appreciate you coming Just a little background on me. I worked for a Bay Area member in Washington DC And part of the reason that I genuinely believe in Roe and believe in Getting him to Congress is that I think we need some new new blood in DC some new ideas We've had some amazing leaders come out of the area But I think it's time to get someone new and get somebody who's ready to kind of Change things up a little bit So I really believe in Roe I hope that you know we can all get out there and get the word out on him because I know everybody here believes in him too And I was just gonna take a second and kind of tell you guys how far and wide reaching this campaign is I know a lot of our staffs coming from places like New York We're lucky enough to get Erica out of DC myself coming from North Carolina We all have our individual reasons why we're actually out and we're supporting Roe Whether it be the focus on STEM education So so many other things I mean down to just to actually trying to tackle some of the traffic congestion I love the breadth to this platform, but myself personally It's not just the fact that I actually am very excited for someone to Really focus on restructuring student debt, which is something that's very important to me But also what made me get up and leave my home state and come out to California to make sure that we can get Roe in office Is because of the change that this campaign is gonna bring one thing super important to me is the fact that we're not taking pack This is a entirely grassroots driven campaign and that's something that I hope everyone in here knows how special that is That's not something that you're seeing and not only other congressional races throughout the country, but any race really anymore This is something that we're taking a stand on And this campaign hopefully not To get Roe in office so that we can kind of Plan a seed and grow further change in Congress and finally get things moving again But also set the model and show other candidates across the country that this can be done You can challenge and incumbent you can make change happen by coming together So again, I just want to welcome everyone and say thank you Thank you for the support for the campaign. Thank you for being out tonight And we'll go ahead and get to some great introductions and get some people out here I got a new slogan for you Field the role So I would like to introduce I'm sorry I was in the back Sorry, how'd you put down my case? I want to thank all of you for coming here because this the great city of Santa Clara This is a great place for Roe to be I even like you being in this building because You're downtown and this is a great place for you to be and welcome to our city absolutely Um to all you young people this man is an inspiration to all of you I want you to get out there and beat those doors With brass ones that's how you make things You get out there you walk you talk and not taking that money gives you a stronger hold And to do well basically to get what you would done as a policymaker You don't have to worry about somebody be holding to what you want and to get your message through So bottom line bro. Thank you. I came here to support you And thank you to come to my city of Santa Clara and it will be out there being the drums for you And I hope that everybody in this room takes us very seriously He needs to be there.

This is a special place for me My family goes back a few generations here in Santa Clara and my grandfather have a store in the old downtown Which was knocked over with redevelopment But um we go back generations and in this place And look on these grounds across the street and here in the Franklin Wall many many many political Campaigns have started and future politicians have come out of these out of these walls these lovely Franklin Walls So we're so happy to have row here We're gonna take credit for you Beautiful Franklin mom Santa Clara that that's grown the most wonderful congressman of all time So um we we're gonna do that I'm really happy and excited probably a lot of you read that we have some issues going on in Santa Clara right now And they really stand around integrity honesty openness and transparency in government and I think that I know councilwoman Davis and I have been fighting really hard for those kinds of things and we see these qualities in row I mean, they're so evident that he's the unpoliticians politician He's a straight talker a straight shooter and someone that we believe we can trust and stand behind and say that he's the one for us Um what struck me as funny is um Saturday night. We had a big concert at Santa Clara University Uh Huey Lewis in the news played and the city sponsored it Debbie. Now you enjoyed ourselves. We danced all night um But but we had our our mayor. I mean our former Gone on stage and with the council and he was dragging along the southern man who's our congressman right now And he was introducing him to our community and he's been our congressman for 16 years And people don't know him. He's introducing him And it just goes to show that our city of Santa Clara that we think is so important He doesn't we haven't seen him in 16 years But you know what this gentleman row Conna He came when we had a little soccer issue with the 49ers He was there speaking for us and standing up for us When we had a library that needed to be open north of Bayshore There is robe congressman who no row was there helping us And just lately we had a little thing we have all this development going on in the city and we have people that don't want to pick park fees But you know what? Row was there speaking for our park fees he didn't have to do that. He didn't have to do that Um, he's not taking pack money neither are Debbie and I and for different reasons No one will give us any pack So why are we been acting? Okay, we've been acting. We're not getting any pack money But hey, but we still have that in common But I'm gonna end this by saying I'm so happy you're here. I'm proud that you're here You're in the hardest Santa Clara Everyone that's gonna meet you here from the old quad and comes down for farmers market They're gonna get to know you and they're gonna love you as much as we love you So good luck row. We're here behind you And finally I want to introduce Rose right wife Good evening everyone On behalf of my self, I want to thank you all for being here. It's a great turnout It's great for us to see the excitement and commitment that people have to the campaign Um, I for one I'm really excited that we're opening the office because as many of you know, Row and I just recently got married in August Um, and I moved out here in September so during the last campaign, you know, I'd come out and visit and He was campaigning and going to all kinds of stuff But one of the things I really enjoyed was when we would stop by the office and spend time there Um, and the reason was because it's it's sort of where people would gather and make phone calls Or Mon tears would kind of start their day together or start their shifts and This is an energy there, and I think that's a really exciting part of a campaign So much of the campaign of course happens spread out throughout the community as it should Every time you're not gonna door or talk to one of your neighbors about what Rose doing But it's it's kind of exciting when there's a concentrated effort in one space And I think it really creates the energy and excitement that The campaign needs and keeps going so it's a lot of fun for me when I would come out I can't really have a chance to do that and I hope now that I'm living here in the Bay area I'll be able to spend more time in the office and And to know the volunteers better I'll admit that I'm still finding my way around and I've gotten to know the Fremont area I don't know the Santa Clara area Clara area as well And I think this is going to be an opportunity for me to spend some time and explore this this part of town So I'm looking forward to that um But I'm just really excited really excited for the energy that's here and for what's going to happen in this in this space Over the coming months. I think I can I sort of you know It looks the way it does now, but I can I was talking to Brian and I can envision What it's gonna look like in a few months when people are in here and working And really trying their best and You know you see people of all ages and all backgrounds that come into this space together and are sitting Elbow to elbow with someone that they would never meet or that they would never work with But they have a common goal and they're excited about the campaign And they're excited about the values that Ro has and so they find something to to work on together. So it's really exciting But again, thank you everyone for being here and for everyone who's put time into getting the office ready Um, and now I will give you the row Thank you Thank you It was it was Rithus birthday yesterday, so Great having her and what a great great turnout um, let me just say About first Debbie Davis Debbie and I were friends before Politics and we had a long conversation about How she grew up how I grew up both both on the East Coast but both to families that cared about the country There's a sense of patriotism a sense of growing up in the middle class and she ran such an extraordinary campaign when she ran from nowhere I mean wasn't part of the old boys' clobbit wasn't part of the endorsed folks and crushed everyone because and then I said How does she do that and I realized that well she's Quietly volunteering in every part of the community not putting her name out there not doing actually going and Doing the work and it made me realize that voters in Santa for a very smart to elect someone like her You're lucky to have her and I'm excited to work with you for many years to come. Thank you Debbie for being here And I just want to make it very clear I mean We Lisa Lisa Gilmore is someone I admire and I know the mercury news and some reporters are here Let me be very very clear Lisa Gilmore should be the next mayor of Santa Clara I say that not because it's evident to have a lot of Santa Clara that she has and The the generations of Gilmore's that have served the community and we're so lucky to be in the heart Santa Clara with this office But it's because Lisa you know there are two types of politicians political leaders If you've had years of public service. There's a types of become Content and say okay. I'm just gonna preserve the status. Well That's a easy way because you've got name recognition you get elected and you stay there And then there the folks are saying I'm actually going to take all that good will And stand up for what is right and pick fights for people and not the special interest And Lisa has done that time and time again with such courage with such integrity She's a role model Santa Clara so desperately needs her and I'm there for her For whatever she does because she is an exceptional public service. So thank you Lisa I'm gonna be brief in my remarks, but if you'll indulge me If I can recognize a few folks because this is like a family And there've been so many people here who have made this office opening in our campaign possible My chair Steve Spinner he's not often in the background, but he has been the given his life to the campaign for almost four years Uh campaign team this time and and what I'm so impressed with is that is there you have really Uh Taken to the community and been part of the community and engaged in the community with Brian Harvey or campaign manager and Character or political record Sam who's are from free a regional director in freemont Chris, I think I saw him in Sunnyvale Kevin Fox was in In Santa Clara and he's gotten to really know the community And then any I don't know if Eddie is here Gary Lives in Sunnyvale, but is is helping in elite in Cupertino they have been extraordinary in in their efforts And I hope you'll all get to work with that So let's give them a round of applause I Probably a community leaves I could single out everyone here, uh, but you know Chris Nichols was there in the very beginning if Patty Picard I you must know this this and everyone he sent a tweet out. It's like the whole What's going on so I Appreciate everything you've done Ben manure who was there when I had the crazy idea of running in the first place and Linda and Tom and And there's so many folks it is Daisy True here. I've Daisy Daisy has been an extraordinary friend and I appreciate your not being going to To Sacramento to stay here and Thelma and Thank you for your Expo leadership and David Wessel of the the Sunnyvale Democratic Club I hesitate to do this because Kai because you leave people out, but I just wanted to say the the Brian Dowe and JP thank you then the The I'll try to get to everyone but the campaign Has been a family it has it has been a People say you know when I When we lost a very close race at 48.2% if people like Andy Raderman and others and horses last time and we lost People said oh of course he's gonna run again. Of course. He's gonna run again But it's not it's not that simple for people who are you know when you run and put your heart out into something You don't make it these campaigns take a lot out of you and Ritzo and I remember we went to Ihoff for the day after the election You know, I love chocolate chip banana pancakes And you know we have these pancakes and we're talking and and and honestly It wasn't clear What I was going to do. I mean there was But we I was inundated with emails. I mean when the cell and I were emailing midnight and and she was doing All of these emails over people saying look you you got to keep going you've got to keep Fighting for the community you got to keep at at what you're doing This is not just about your campaign. It's about a movement that we've started and To me this campaign is so important because we're at such a Important time in our country's history There is an anxiety out there. I mean anyone who saw the New Hampshire results knows there's a anxiety that The country then I grew up in my parents immigrated from India for country where it you work hard you study hard You make good grades. You're gonna have a shot at the American dream That basic idea is being questioned The folks are thinking that the game is right That They may work hard. They may study hard, but they may not have a shot at the American dream For the first time in our country's history think about that for the first time People are worried whether the young folks here whether your generation is going to have a better life Than the previous generation That's never happened before And there are two ways to deal with that anxiety One is to appeal to people's fears to say you know Middle class is struggling people aren't getting work Let's blame people. Let's blame immigrants. Let's blame The global economy. Let's blame folks who are doing well But my view is is that going to solve the problem? Is that going to get someone who is studying at Wilcox was studying at Independence a shot at the American dream? Is that going to create an American identity in a nation that we're going to be proud of in the 21st century? I want our campaign to be a positive answer To what America needs to do in the 21st century Not one that appeals to people's fears, but one that appeals to people's hopes When we say we're not going to take pack money and lobbyist money It's not to say all the people in politics are evil or corrupt It's to say there's a better way That the currency of ideas can trump the currency of money in political life And if you don't believe me just look at the founders. They did it And it was much harder for them than it is for us We're saying that there's a better way in American politics that's consistent with our traditions That when you have someone at Wilcox knock on your door That's more powerful than 15 mailers that come into your mailbox That when you have people who talk about Changing politics because they have a passion for male-icking college debt free But they have a passion for making sure that women and men are treated with equity and are Making the same amount of money for the same amount of work or that they care about Ideas or public transportation and transportation that comes to Santa Clara not just San Jose That those are ideas that can convince people on their merits That's what this campaign is ultimately about that we want a campaign based on ideas And not based on special interests And to do that you know people say now you know last cycle they would come up to me and say I'm with you But you got no shot to win which was fine And now they know it got people coming up to me say oh you're gonna win and I said well Let's let's let's go on whether Whether we are gonna win or not Here is my favorite that and this is people saying you know and nerd or something My favorite quote was for Winston Churchill and he had said Deserved victory and he said that that what he meant by that is it's not just about winning It's about deserving to win. It's about running a campaign that is worthy of victory I want this campaign to be a model for this country. I want this campaign to talk to inspire people to believe that young folks Can make a difference that you don't have to be beholden to walk the Wall Street money or special interests But you can offer a positive economic message. It's gonna provide hope and opportunity for the middle class I want folks to say that here in Santa Clara You have someone who's a fourth or fifth generation like Lisa Gilmore Standing side by side with immigrants and immigrant from Palestine I met today from people whose parents came from India from folks who've come from all over the world To form a common identity for a better politics That is our possibility and to do that I need we need each of us to go out to be passionate to try to make a change I'm gonna give my heart to this campaign. Rendo is gonna give her heart to to this campaign And my ask if you is get engaged be passionate Let's go and show that we can not only win this race, but have a positive vision That's considered an inspire people around the county and around the country Thank you for being here. Thank you to the great Well, there's not really any way possible to try to top that So I'm not even gonna start but I do want everyone to hear from Another supporter a huge supporter much like yourselves in here And just talk a little bit about their experience in their story. Why they're out today Peter Hootton if you can come up So I first volunteered when I was 15 and first that was like a hundred years And The reason I volunteer is You know there's a phrase about life going on I couldn't stand to see whatever happens in the country if I did try to make some change Uh, and we talk about We're all progressives we're Democrats. What does that really mean? It means you want to make some progress You want something to change and I can't understand How Santa Clara County can view my conda as a progressive. He's a conservative. He wants to stay with the old world So I saw row running in 2014 And I said this is a leader So I voted for Honda when my district now 18 was in his I became redistricted and and I was a loyal voter for my conda But I see the need for leadership. We lost the Congress. We lost the House. We lost the Senate This chance we could lose the presidency We have to have leaders And we have to get them now So that when we retake the House by 2020 We have people who can lead Uh, committees So I see row is not just a loyal Democrat, but he's going to be the leader of committees And that's going to make change happen and that's why I was drawn to row come Now why I'm a volunteer? So we have three categories of people here We have the students We have the middle age and we have the retiree Like me although I'm not retired. I mean my seventh startup Five years each and you all get acquired So good luck to you and I view this campaign as a startup So for students The most important thing you do is learn new skills for your life And understand what you enjoy and what you don't And you get that experience by volunteering You'll find out what you like to do Uh, if you're in the middle age group A lot of the books have been written about why women don't get the top leadership jobs Because they're not sure they can take that next challenge When they're offered an opportunity Can you rise to it? It's not just women Everybody goes through that And you know when you're a volunteer You have a chance to try things that you wouldn't have otherwise And you gain confidence Self-confidence is a big part of how you advance And then if you're in the last category the over 65 You know if you don't exercise your muscles atrophy You get that wrinkled skin But if you exercise You are you are tone And how do you exercise your mind Your volunteer you try things that you've never tried before So last weekend I started canvassing in the past I was a phone banker I'm a canvasser And so in an hour and a half I got 10 signatures on the petition And the reason is I wanted to learn about the people So obviously I had traction with the uh, 65 and over And I wanted to find out about their life story of their family Nobody could refuse to sign the endorsements We need you on every night If you each get 10 that's 100 tonight 35 nights you got the 35 of the signatures you're on the ballot Hey, Wake, there's a big reward for being a volunteer And it's a personal reward Of course you're going to drag along all your family and friends So suddenly we're there This could be so close Dragging along all those people is going to make the difference So thank you Thank you And thank you everyone for being here It means so much our our staff work so hard to make this a successful event Our interns also did amazing work about All of the decorations with good handwriting are from our high school interns And anything you can't read was probably me or another member of our staff So thank you so much We haven't uh, we say it over and over again The students in this district are unbelievable impressive We're so lucky to have 100 campaigns so thank you I almost everything that I was playing to say has already been said I just want to quickly let everybody know that this is a critical moment for our campaign This is a kickoff and more ways than what we're opening the office And we're really ramping up our field program I have a numbers guy And the numbers don't lie and the numbers tell us There is nothing more effective for changing someone's mind And for getting someone to vote Than a personal conversation with a real human being More than TV More than mail More than anything else you can do And it matters so much that you Who've taken the time to come here to support row Take the time to convince your neighbors And your friends to also support row So our staff have been circulating onto your sign-up sheets We would love it if you could donate some of your time There are also circulating petition sheets We need to collect signatures to get row into ballot Please do not weave without signing the petition And without making sure you've talked to one of our staff members So I won't keep you any longer I think we still have a ton of great food over there The only problem with this whole event Is that we didn't have enough tables to hold the amazing food you all brought Which is a great problem to have So thank you again And thank you for being members of TeamRoute We're going to win this thing together Thank you so much",

        "transcript": " Let me end with some remarks, a little more personal. You see in our country's history, there have always been two different visions of America, two different strands. There has been leaders like Lincoln who appealed to the better angels of our nature, and there has also been an uglier strand that the country has always had to deal with, whether that strand was xenophobia, or racism, or slavery, or segregation. The great thing about this nation is that the better vision of America always wins out in the long run. I believe, I believe in an America that will compete not by playing to stereotypes, but will compete by striving for excellence. I believe in an America that will not begrudge other nations their success, but will lead by inventing the future. I believe in an America that will not close itself off to the rest of the world, but will embrace the dreams of people around the world. You see, that's the America my parents came to. That's the America. They came in these heavy times in the 1960s. John F. Kennedy calling us to send a man to the moon. This time where people believed in this nation's ability to inspire the world. You know what? I saw a glimpse of that America and these young kids who were knocking doors. I saw it in them. This sense that there's this one place in the world where merit and hard work can take you as far as you want to go. People say this election is about my condo or me, tech versus labor, you know, the democratic establishment versus the Sheryl Sandberg, but you know what? They get it all wrong. They get it all wrong. This election is about something much deeper. This election is about the soul of our nation. What type of America do we want to be? I believe years from now, regardless of the results and I know we're going to do very well in winning November, but I believe years from now when people look back and they look at this room. They will say in this unique city of Kupertino, in this unique city began a unique moment where the children of immigrants from India and Vietnam and China and the Philippines were signed by side with third and fourth generation Santa Clarence to renew a sense of purpose in our nation and restore our democratic ideals, to pave the way for the America that my parents came to, to pave the way for a new great American century. That's what we're fighting for. This is our mission. That's why we must win in November. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " So I'd like to start off today with Rokana. Thank you to everyone, all the constituents from the district for taking the time out on a weekday. And thank you to the media for being here to cover this event. This is a very respectful gathering and the purpose is very simple. As I have had the opportunity to campaign for over a year and a half across this district, the best part has been meeting constituents, meeting students and talking to folks. We have done over 190 meeting reads. I've not done over 5,000 doors. And every time we have an open town hall meeting or a meeting read, I will hear something from a constituent or from a person about what they believe, what they want to see happen in this country and take their feedback. What is self-disappointing is that Congressman Honda has not been engaged in this very basic premise of representative democracy. I mean, there was an article in the economist recently, which compared the United States Congress to European nobility, saying that the turnover rate in the United States Congress is less than nobility in Europe. And our founders would be rolling over in their graves if they knew that in a five week recess, where folks are supposed to come and talk to constituents and answer their questions, a congressman has not had a single town hall. Oh no. Now, this is not about Congressman Honda or me. This is about what's wrong with our democracy. We're supposed to meet with people and constituents and take their ideas. We're supposed to answer tough questions about the Middle East or about Ukraine or about why we're losing jobs. And you're supposed to get answers that people may disagree with, but not duck from the debate that is the homework of democracy. And my disappointment with Congressman Honda not doing an answering town halls and questions has very little to do with this campaign. But in my judgment is symbolic, emblematic of exactly what's wrong with American politics, that we no longer have folks who feel any degree of accountability. Other people who represented this new district and I issue even the infamous repeat start, they used to new town halls. You know, Josh covered some of them. They'd be entertaining affairs, but they would subject themselves to voters and the questions that people would have. And I really hope that whatever the outcome of this campaign is, the Congressman Honda will start to hold open public forums, listen to the ideas that people in this district have and take them to Washington and answer the tough questions. And it raises questions why he has been unwilling to do that this entire recess. The second thing is debates. You know, now when I started out this campaign, I admit I was a little naive and I guillistic and I said, let's have Lincoln Douglas style debates and raise the dialogue and Congressman Honda and I can be out there for a couple hours in every city talking about the issues. And honestly, I thought I had very little chance to win, but I thought, okay, let me go and raise the dialogue. Let's raise the issues that concern this district when we started out. But what we have been met with is absolute silence. Not a single debate has taken place since this campaign has begun. And it is just disappointing not again because of this campaign, but it's disappointing for the voters. The voters in this district deserve debates. They deserve an honest, open discussion about the issues. And they don't deserve just one debate rigged close to the election to make sure that someone doesn't make a gap. They deserve an honest, open dialogue about the issues of few debates so they can make an informed choice about who is better representative of their needs. Again, it's not something to score political points. It's something that is so fundamental to the job of a representative Congressman that I hope for his own legacy, Congressman Honda, will listen to the people in this district and engage in those debates. Finally, before I hand it over to some of our speakers, the fundamental thing I think about being a Congressman, it's a pretty vocal job. It's not like being a big shot in Washington. Your job is actually to listen to your constituents and take care of them and listen to their needs and be accessible to them. And folks who work with our campaign know I'll answer Facebook posts at 3 in the morning and I'll answer emails from constituents who have questions. And I love the part of the job that I love most as a candidate is talking to people and meeting them and being able to one day hopefully help work on their issues. And what is disappointing about Congressman Honda is that maybe he started out that way, but there has been a sense where he's lost that. A sense where he's no longer connected to the grassroots to the community listening to them, helping them, helping them with their issues. And I think this stems from a sense of entitlement. And what surprised me most in this whole campaign was how offended, upset Congressman Honda and his supporters have been that I'm even running for Congress. I'm not upset that Congressman Honda is running. I think it's great. I wanted to believe him. But somehow he's upset at this very idea that someone would run. Well let me tell you something in this country. These seats don't belong to these career politicians. They belong to the people. And they have to be earned. The right thing on a Congress has to be earned every two years. All we're asking Congressman Honda with respect is give people the chance to make an informed choice. Present your ideas, present your vision, let us present ours, and then let the people decide who best will represent them. I'm content with that outcome. I hope he will too. And I hope he will show a respect not for me as a candidate, but for the democratic process at a time where our country needs them. Thank you. Thank you to everyone for being here.",

        "transcript": " What a great crowd, great energy. Bernie Sanders has a simple moral vision for America's future. Instead of spending $6 trillion on endless wars, we need to invest in healthcare, in education, in infrastructure, in clean energy, in every community across America. Bernie Sanders doesn't just talk about these things. He delivers. He didn't just talk about ending the war in Yemen. Listen up, listen up. He passed in the first time in the history of the United States, the first time ever a war power resolution through the Senate to end the Civil War in Yemen. That's about saving lives, 14 million Yemenis who face possible famine. But let me tell you, it's more than that. Yemen is a precedent for a simple principle. No more unconstitutional wars. And I know, I know when Bernie Sanders is president, he will not get us into a single war without congressional authorization. Bernie Sanders doesn't just talk about raising wages. He delivers. When he introduced the stop-based OSAC, you guys remember that. Three weeks later, Jeff Bezos raised wages for 350,000 Americans across this country. Here's my question. If Bernie Sanders in the minority in the Senate can get 350,000 Americans erased, imagine what he will do when he's president of the United States. Bernie Sanders doesn't just talk about Medicare for all because it's fashionable. The movement he led with all of you led to the majority of Democrats in the House of Representatives being four Medicare for all. And with his leadership, we will finally get a vote in the House and the Senate for Medicare for all and get that passed. Let me end with this. The volume of our politics has gotten loud. There are a lot of people who talk, but what we need is people who think and do. The president loves to talk. And talk. And talk. Two hours yesterday. But at a time when people are cynical about government, when they're weary of promises broken, when they crave more substance and conviction in our politics, we need someone whose life experience speaks for itself. We need someone who has had a lifetime of integrity to reclaim our democracy. That person is Bernie Sanders. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Mr. Speaker, good evening. I rise today to oppose President Trump's anti-immigrant executive orders. And to share with you why I feel these orders harm the people across my district and ultimately across our nation. I'm here because my grandfather came here as an Italian immigrant back in 1921. He told us that the reason he came here was to give his children a better life. And he wanted a chance to achieve what I think we all know to be the American dream. I'm here in front of you living the reality of that dream. And that is why I strive every day as best as I can to give back to my country and community here in Washington, D.C. and especially on the Central Coast of California. I do that not only because of my grandfather, but because it was our forefathers that made it clear that this is a nation. This is a country based on we, the people. And so to me, in this country, being American means that all of us bear the burden to serve one another and to welcome those, especially those who are willing to come here and share in that responsibility. I believe that we should embrace them. I believe that we should embolden them with the opportunities to share in that American dream. We know that the world looks to the United States for enlightened leadership. But these ill-advised actions send a wrong message about our values as a nation. We are a nation of immigrants. We are stronger because of our diversity and because of the people who have taken the risks to come here just as my grandfather did to live here and to contribute to our country and our communities. On the Central Coast of California, that is the heart and soul of that area. I see hardworking men and women who come to this country to live in it and contribute to it. The two main industries there on the Central Coast are agriculture and tourism. Big industries. There are people, workers, owners who contribute greatly, not only to those industries but to our communities. And they are our neighbors, our friends, our families, our children. They sit next to my two daughters and play with them at school. Clearly without them, my community would be a shell of its former self. I hear the pain in their voices because they feel that this administration's executive orders targets them and makes them feel unwelcome. And I've seen that these types of executive orders drive a wedge in our country and it drives them further away, participating in our community. Before I was sworn in on January 3rd of this year, I was a prosecutor. And before the five and a half years I was there in the Monterey County District Attorney's Office. And in that type of prosecution, as you can imagine, as you know well, it can be very difficult to have witnesses come forward and participate in one of the cornerstones of our country, our criminal justice system. They are intimidated. They are worried about retribution and retaliation. But now from what I've heard is that they are worried not just about criminals, they are worried about the government. The government cracking down on them if they came forward, cracking down on them and sending them back to where they came from. These executive orders discourage participation in our community. But instead, as a nation, we should encourage people to step up, to step forward and to be a part of our criminal justice system. Last weekend I met with community members and I heard directly from them about their concerns. And this weekend, I'm doing it again. I'm holding a town hall to continue this conversation. I believe it is our responsibility to listen to all of our community members and consider the implications of these types of executive orders and the implications that they have on all of our constituents. When the President of the United States was sworn in, he took a note to protect all members of our nation by supporting and defending our Constitution. As a member of Congress, I took a note to support and defend that very same Constitution. And rest assured, I will honor that oath. And I will honor that oath to my grandfather and to this country by fighting and resisting unconstitutional orders from this or any other President. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",

        "transcript": " We are beginning with President Obama's new plan to fight terrorism and his call for Congress to take action. Tonight, two local congressional candidates talk about what they think needs to be done. Action News reporter Caitlin Conrad has more in our top story live from Monterey. Dan, both the Democratic and the Republican candidate for the seat here on the Central Coast are calling for a united front in the attack against ISIS, but only Casey Lucius was available for a sit-down interview and she outlined some of the strategies she'd like to see initiated. Republican candidate Casey Lucius has been paying close attention to what's being done to stop domestic terrorism attacks and she thinks a more aggressive stance needs to be taken against ISIS, including the use of ground troops. Absolutely, I think we should ramp up our military efforts, but we shouldn't do it alone. I think everything the U.S. does has to be a multilateral effort, so we need to convince our allies and partners to become more engaged, but we can't do that if we're going to be on the sidelines. Lucius says an online offensive against the Islamic State and economic sanctions against countries supporting the terrorists are also pieces of the strategy puzzle that are missing, along with action Congress needs to take to fund the National Counterterrorism Center. All government agencies are under resourced, but that's an area that really deserves I think top priority. They need to have the propagabilites and the proper funding from Congress. Deputy District Attorney Jimmy Panetta is also running for Congress. He was not able to meet in person today because he was in trial, but did release this statement on the president's Oval Office of Dress saying, it was important for the president to address this crisis facing the American people. What is critical now is the American people are unified behind the effort to defeat ISIS. It is not a crisis that can be dealt with from fear, but from strength. The other thing that Casey Lucius wants to see Congress do is to reinstate WITS, the worldwide incident tracking system. It was shut down in 2012. What it does is it gives the U.S. government a platform to see all of the incidents happening around the world and get live updates on them. Dan. All right. Thank you very much, Caitlin. Lucius also says more needs to be done to reassure Americans that ISIS can and will be defeated, including hearing it from our representatives. More of our commitment 2016 coverage now, Assemblyman Luis Alayjo has announced he is seeking a seat on the Monterey County Board of Supervaces. Before being elected to the assembly, he served as mayor in Watsonville. That's in Santa Cruz County. Alayjo tells Action News he moved to Salinas in November in order to run for the District One seat in Monterey County. For the past five years, his assembly district has included about half of Monterey County. His run for supervisor will mean he will take on incumbent Fernando Armenta, who has held that District One seat for 15 years. The current incumbent is not delivering for the residents of District One. I looked at what has been accomplished in the Supervisorial District and I think the voters deserve better. My message to the voters in this community, do you want somebody with good, solid experience or do you want somebody that's going to be here today and gone tomorrow? Luis Alayjo's wife, Carina Servantes Alayjo will be sworn in tomorrow as Pro Tem mayor in Watsonville. She says she'll stay in Watsonville through her term that ends in December of next year and while she is running to replace her husband in the assembly. We've also learned Alayjo has formed a campaign committee for a 2018 State Senate run. If he is successful, he would replace Anthony Canella, who is not eligible because he is",

        "transcript": " Adam Speaker, my constituents have faced drought conditions for years, communities throughout the Central Valley and the entire American West are running out of water for daily use in homes, businesses, and agriculture production. Farmers are being forced to follow their fields and dry out their orchards, and hundreds of thousands of acres will be unable to be planted again this year. Instead of coming to the table to work on real solutions that would give families and farmers in my community the water they desperately need to survive. The majority has decided they would rather play politics with the most critical resource in the valley. Apparently passing political messaging bills to check a box is more important to my democratic colleagues than trying to save the livelihood of thousands of valley farmers trying to put food on the table of Americans across the country. This bill is completely silent on the desperate need for enhanced water storage infrastructure to better prepare us during wet years. It does not cut red tape, decrease time delays, or address increased project costs due to redundant requirements underneath it. The bottom line is this bill is bad policy and it bad policy for the Central Valley. My colleagues don't seem to understand that the fewer agriculture products the Central Valley produces, the worse off our own domestic food supply will be. Reduced ag means more of a reliance on other nations for our food, which is an issue for national security. We must do better to address the severe drought we are suffering through the American West. The Wynn Act which passed by partisan support under President Obama in 2016 provided real relief to valley farmers by increasing operational flexibility of the Central Valley project and the state water project. It also authorized millions of dollars for important water infrastructure projects to improve the current canal, the Delta Mendoza Canal, and the California aqueduct. The Wynn Act was critical to ensuring that valley families in rural communities and across the United States have clean, reliable water. We made great progress because of this legislation. Unfortunately, authorities under the Wynn Act expired in 2021 and this is why I introduced the Renew Wynn Act. To extend storage and operations provisions for the Wynn Act and authorize funds for critical water storage projects. Over three quarters of the Democrats in this house supported the positions in 2016, but this week they refused to include my bill in this so-called drought relief package. They are blocking an actual solution to the crisis in the name of environmental justice. Madam Speaker, where is the justice in letting thousands of valley farmers lose their livelihoods because they cannot get something as basic as water? If this drought bill was truly about solving the water crisis in the west, the House majority would include the Renew Wynn Act in this package instead of actively blocking its consideration. And once again urging the House majority to consider this legislation that will bring water to the people in my community doing everything possible to survive this terrible drought. I urge the Democrat majority to stop playing politics with the resource that the entire country is so reliant on.",

        "transcript": " So I can stand for a slide. All right, great. So first of all, I want to touch about Representative McCarthy's new position. What do you think about that? Well, obviously, I think it's a good thing for California. When you have someone in that position, I think a lot of people don't appreciate the importance of that position when it comes to negotiating and things that get passed through Congress. When we negotiate with the Senate, the majority leader is there at the table, obviously with the speaker, also the setting the calendar, making sure that items come to the floor and making sure that when they come to the floor, most people agree to them. And having a voice from the valley here, like, kind of McCarthy in that position is a good thing for us. A lot of people said that the recent air Cantor lost that bid was he didn't have a strong opinion on immigration reform and it was just back and forth. Do you think that McCarthy will be doing better in that point? Well, as far as specific issues, I think that air Cantor lost just for that reason. I think there's a lot that goes into a person losing or winning a race to try to pinpoint it on any specific issue, I think, is wrong. As far as Kevin's been pretty clear on some of his positions, and we're going to continue to work with him to make sure that whatever is done is done to the benefit of the valley. And on that topic, immigration reform president, while I just spoke about that, he's saying that the House of Representatives, they are not doing enough and that he's going to take some executive action. What do you think about that? Well, obviously, executive action is bad for a lot of reasons. The purpose of the legislative branch is to openly debate a piece of legislation. And if it's openly debated, it allows the input of the communities. There's 435 members of Congress. And when we go through the process of debating this, having a member of Congress in the debate and having that voice, just like myself, I had a community coffee here last week. I have tele-town halls. People have access to me, but they do not have access to the president. So one person sitting in one house passing a piece of legislation is dangerous because it's not going to cover all aspects that need to be covered. So it's a really dangerous place to go. And that's why we have the legislative branch, is to make sure that people are represented and laws are passed that are beneficial to all. And if the president is going to decide to take this route, I think that's going to be hurtful to everybody. I do wish the House would act and start to pass legislation. There has been some that have passed, but there needs to be more. And so I have obviously been advocate for immigration reform. I'm going to continue to be an advocate for it, and I'm going to continue to work to make sure that we carry out our responsibilities as a legislative branch and pass these bills. How are there any talks between you and the gang of aid? The Senate has already passed it, but is there any? You know, there was a gang of hate in the House, and I did work closely with a few of them before that gang of aid broke up. As far as new people out there pushing, we're not even really new people. A lot of the same people are still the same people who are acting on immigration reform. There is a lot of talk, there is a lot of push to make sure some legislation comes forward. The majority later, and the old majority later, Eric Canter, and the transition out of Kevin McCarthy has slowed down some progress right now in the House, but I expect us to still continue to push once things get settled. What have you heard from your constituents regarding that? You know, for the most part, my constituents are very supportive of seeing something done. I think they want it to be fair. They want it to be respectful of those who have tried to follow the laws, but they also want to make sure that we resolve this in a way that doesn't put us in the same position 20 years from now. I mean, you can't pass amnesty. You have to pass a program that helps future flow, resolves the situation we have today, and also protects American workers at the same time. And so that's why it has to be something that covers all those aspects, and that's why I've been supportive of the comprehensive. And what do you think about the humanitarian crisis that has been focused now? Well, the humanitarian crisis that's going on along the border is obviously something very sad that has to be addressed. And that is something that's obviously come around because of a lot of the actions that the President has taken, but at the same time, the lack of direction that Congress has taken as well. We have to make sure that we have clear defined laws that work and that prevent things like this from being seen as an option. And I think that if we did take an active role in fixing the immigration system in general, it would have a much larger role in fixing that issue as well. It's something that has to be resolved, obviously. And with a bunch of kids showing up at our border, it's a very sad situation. But we're going to do our best to try to resolve that in a humanitarian way. President Moan did mention just now part of the reason that has to represent its hominable to pass this is because there's that division between the Tea Party members and moderate conservatives. Do you agree with that? You know, one of the original gang of eight is role Labrador, who actually ran from a majority leader with this port of that wing of the party. And there are aspects across the board of people who understand the immigration system is broken and want to fix it. So I think the President is exaggerating when it comes to that. And as far as the water crisis here in California, what have been some of the steps that you guys have been looking at? Well, obviously, HR 3964 was passed off the floor back in February. The Senate passed their bill a couple weeks ago. And now we've been talking with the Senate to come up with a compromise that works to help solve this problem. The talks are actually ongoing. We have been meeting with the Senate our Senate counterparts. And we're doing our best to come up with a solution. As far as short-term solutions, if our bill had been passed back in February and signed into law right away, we wouldn't be in the mess we're in today. The best we can hope for now is preventing next year from being this bad. And as far as elections, so you're running up against the main inventory, what are you looking forward to in that election? Well, we're going to continue to work hard and do everything we're supposed to be doing. I've been representing the district now for about a year and a half. And I think I've done a really good job of reaching out and talking to voters and representing them the way they'd like to see me do so. And the numbers that happened in the primary the early, I think, are pretty evident to that. But we're going to continue to work really hard. We're going to continue to have our community coffees, our tele-town halls, and it just our outreach program in general to stay in contact with the community so that they know who I am and what I'm doing for them. And we'll hope for the best. All right. Do you have anything to help?",

        "transcript": " Wanted to first of all get your reaction to state of the Union address. To state of the Union address time. I think overall is really good. I was obviously a little surprised by the number of guests that he had that he brought up during the speech. I thought it was a pleasant surprise. There's a lot of heartwarming stories there and I mean it was pretty cool. As far as the policy side, I think the president did a really good job laying out a lot of things that the American people wanted to talk about. There's the issue and there are a lot of folks that brought guests to the gallery. Dreamers for example, and he touched on the immigration issue, the 1.8 million that he's willing to work with to get path to citizenship. But he also wants his voter security in return. I think that was the president showing that he wanted to work across the island and come to a compromise and get some real solutions. The pharmaceutical side of it, pain capable or helping terminally ill people have the right to try medications. I think that was something that was nice to hear as well. I think that will affect real people. I've had family members on my own that I've seen struggle and suffer and to have the opportunity to try some new medicines that could potentially save their lives or at least make them more comfortable. It's something that we should look into. Loing the price of pharmaceutical, I think is a great thing. California specifics since we've AB 109 and other things have let so many of our inmates out onto the streets. We find in some sort of second chance program allowing them the opportunity to go out and get jobs. I think it's something that could be really positive for the economy and obviously for the safety of our families at home. There are some good stuff in there. You brought up dreamers and kind of came to mind what I was listening to that was. We started talking to that one couple weeks ago. We started talking about some of that. A couple weeks ago we talked about to figure out now up to 1.8 million. How did that happen? Now up to 1.8 million. How did that happen? Well, so if you understand the DACA dreamer and all the different piece of legislation, it all plays a role in when they came to the US and at what age they were. At what age they were before 18, whatever. All those things play a role in how that number is calculated. The President came to a number of 1.8 million so he obviously changed the calculation a little bit. He probably changed some dates and moved it made a little bit wider. But yeah, the DACA component of it, the one that President Obama pushed, was about 700,000 maybe 800,000. Dreamer bills and a few other piece of legislation here in the house, pushed a little bit higher numbers. But 1.8 million was a much higher number than I had heard in the past. I know you're attending D'Alene toward voting. I know you're attending D'Alene in a favor of such a program. What you do that without a wall? What you do that without a wall? Well, we want to make sure that the border security component is. I know that the wall is kind of the buzzword, but even meeting with Secretary Nilsen, Secretary of Homeland Security, and the White House, a little bit about this issue. It's not so much about building a wall, see, designing, see, but it is about making sure our border is secure in whatever way a shape or fashion that means. There are going to be parts of the area that they think the wall is the most obvious choice and there's going to be other areas where it will be technology and some sort of smart technology that can make sure it's secure. I think all those things play a role. I think there's also a place for changing the way that we treat people who come up to the border and especially when the cartels are training people on what words to use and how to talk to the border agents so that they can be granted asylum or other special treatment and get right on through. That's an issue that we've got right now and there's no border or no type of security that will stop it when they're walking up and using our own laws against us. Those are all things that need to be looked at and part of this compromise. Another thing that President mentioned tonight was the infrastructure of the United States and the infrastructure of the United States. From where it is today and he's willing to spend $1.5 trillion to do that. How do you justify that with a $20 trillion debt? How do you justify that with a $20 trillion debt? So that's going to be the hard part and that's one that when you mentioned the 1.5 I kind of smiled and looked to a fellow appropriator friend of mine said next to me and I thought that's a lot of money we're going to have to do some digging for this. It is a pretty high mark but obviously we want to do everything we can. Our infrastructure is crumbling. We have a lot of need around the country. Obviously roads, freeways and especially for the Central Valley water infrastructure is so important. If there's any opportunity or any place, any rock we can dig under for a little extra money I think it's well worth and it's something we should strive for. Congressman, what was your reaction of... Of course, it might have been difficult for you to see but it's a reaction of Democrats tonight. When the pressure starts going through some of these numbers like the unemployment figures of the Black Connolly, the Hispanic unemployment historically low, the first talking about how people for a low case have been pumped up lately. Businesses, reinvesting in America, what do you think of people like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who said people are handsome? It was a little frustrating to see and I did try to watch on the other side on specific topics. I was a little surprised when the 1.8 million on immigration they didn't stand up and applaud that. They all jumped up when they talked about lower in the cost of pharmaceuticals. So there was a few times they jumped up but I would say more often than not I was disappointed to see that they didn't at least applaud the things they agreed with. I sat through four state of the unions with President Obama and when I agreed with them I stood up and I clapped. I thought it was the right thing to do because it shows support and it shows unity on issues that we agree on and it helps build a real path forward on getting things done for the American people. So yeah, I was disappointed. I would hope that they don't continue those actions that we have the opportunity to really accomplish some things for their constituents in mind. It looked like the President was trying to break across the aisle and break and take them down. And those are the other side. Do you think he did that? I don't see anything different. I think he did that. I think he did that. I think he did that. I think he did anything differently. I think in the days going forward. Well I think on some of the topics he did a very good job. I mean I know that they probably weren't thrilled with the Guentanamo Bay stuff but looking for a real solution when it comes to helping people who have served their time in prison, looking for a solution on immigration, looking for a solution on infrastructure. Those are all things that Democrats typically agree with. When you get into the pharmaceutical industry and the cost of pharmaceuticals and medications for our constituents, that's something that they did a plug. But there are a few things there that I thought they should have really been happy with and really applaud a little bit harder. And yeah, frustrated but it doesn't mean that we've got to sit back and complain. Our focus now needs to be on really trying to build some alliances and try to move forward and get some of these good ideas done. Congressman Valdea, thank you for spending time with us today. Congressman Valdea, thank you for spending time with us tonight. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.",

        "transcript": " Hello, and we're back with Off the Press. This is James Berger with the Bakersfield, California. I'm joined today, as always, by Nicole Parach and Russ Johnson, who we've introduced in the past, so I'll zip right along to those who might... Wonderful co-hosts. Just ask your questions. I've been dying to ask the Congressmen. And of course, our guest, David Valdeau. So, as folks who've listened on the show, but no, I love the 21st Congressional District. I love covering it. My job is to report on it. It's a fantastic, diverse... Because it's interesting. It's this geographical district that stretches all of the valley, picks up all these rural, small communities. It's very diverse, very different... Always lots of drama with the boat. Always lots of drama. It was Jerry Mandered, so it could be a Democrat seat. But it was done in accordance with the Voting Rights Act. Wasn't the chairman a big Democrat donor they found out after all that was said and done? All of those things are... Oh, let the games begin. But you've won it twice, so you haven't really been hurt by that. And that's why it's interesting. Because these, you know, even election night, the Republican always starts at the top. This happened with Costa and similar district that happened with Vidak. They always start way ahead. And then the votes come in and it changes as the different communities and different groups of people come in. And it's very interesting to watch and figure out where that's going to end up. And, you know, it is very diverse. The district is very diverse. There's a lot of Latinos, but there are points of view on politics and faith. And all those things are very diverse as well. And so you have... I think almost a microcosm of the country, really, in what the country might become. And so I find it deeply intriguing. And so you represent this. You've won twice. Very handily, both times, once against a weak opponent. Another time against a very strong opponent. Last with Amanda Rattria. And as you mentioned, Vice President Joe Biden came to Cal State Bakersfield and campaigned against you. And you still won with 58% of the vote I believe. And so this year's a little bit different. The primary was a little bit different. You had two aggressive Democratic campaign running. Your California is Amila Huerta, son of Dolores Huerta, a very prominent in the labor community and civil rights community here and the Latino community. And so you're facing a campaign against that. You've got about 55% of the vote still win. But Rattria was able to reduce your vote last time by about 5%. So you could between the primary and the general. And so it could go either way, potentially. What are you doing to make sure that it doesn't happen that way? So you're right. The primary is much tighter this time than it had been in the past. But there are some differences this year versus the past few years. This is the year I did the least in the primary. And this is also the year that had the most. I mean, California actually mattered in a presidential race. And if you look at the Democrat turnout versus the Republican turnout, Republicans turned out just 4,000 people above normal. And I think Democrats turned out about 20,000 above normal. So the Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton played a huge role in drawing people out. But when you look at the numbers, two 60% of the turnout was Democrat and I still won. So that is a positive sign. Our goal now is to try to get as many Republicans out as possible to make sure they show up. My district is 31% Republican and almost 50% Democrat. So it's a tough, tough hill to climb. But we haven't changed anything. We just, we didn't spend as much in our primary as we have in the past. And that focus on that was to make sure that we had the resources necessary for the general. Because we obviously know the general is going to be a much tougher situation. Right. And so obviously, you know, you're in combat that helps you a little bit with voters across all spectrums. So that there's a little bit of help you've done well in the past with Democrats and the past two elections as well. What do you think the primary, you mentioned that again, that Trump and Hillary and Clinton are Hillary and messing it up, that Bernie and Clinton had a strong race and that propelled voters out? Do you think that there is going to be that level of interest in the presidential race in November? It's really hard to say today what it's going to look like in November. But right now, it doesn't look like it's going to be that competitive of a race. And especially being here on the coast, I remember in 2012, leaving Bakersfield and driving up to Hanford. And before I got to Hanford, and before I showed up to my event at eight o'clock, they had already announced that Romney had lost. And so things like that do have an impact. And you start to see some of the polling numbers, you start to see some of the things going on. It will have an impact. I don't know how it'll impact all of our races because if everybody on both sides of size is not to turn out, I mean, that could be, and then it turns it into a real race. But Republicans tend to show up. And so even having a 1617 point disadvantage because Republicans typically show up and vote, it does give you that little bit of an edge. It does. And it's made the difference in the race in the past two elections. The question is, will obviously, will the Republican presidential candidate drive people to the ballot? You know, most of your, most of your constituency is Latino. And, you know, though, as Nicole has said, the Trump is trying to soften his, his verbiage towards minorities and Latinos. But he said some pretty blunt and aggressive things about the nature of those people who you represent. No, I know. And that's something that we've obviously been very aware of. And the thing that in the district, I ran in 2012, and Obama won the district pretty handily. And we actually outperformed Obama in the district. So we've always been able to separate ourselves. We separate ourselves from, and ran our own independent race from, from, we did it with Romney. And we continue to work and do our job in the valley and make sure we touch voters as much as possible and talk to them. So that they know that I am who I am. And whatever they decide to do atop the ticket is their business. But I've done my best to represent them. And I hope they remember that on, on election day. And my goal is to make sure they do. So I worked on a lot of that same district when it was different a little bit. In 2004, the time I worked for a state senator who was running for Congress, trained to take out Jim Costa. And at that time, I got an education on how much the Republican National Congressional Committee, and then you got the Democrat, California, or the... The Detroit National Committee, or the Detroit National Committee. I forget what all the C's are for. But ultimately, so much of a decision happens back in DC. And then all of a sudden, the floodgates open, money comes in, more TV ads, more mailers, all these different things. Are you seeing anything different, dis-election, the last election on that front? And then also, are you getting any real access to some really unique new technology that you're using out in the field when you're going door to door, you're identifying voters? Is there anything new, technology-wise, you're deploying? Yeah, there is always... We started using some of the electronic technology last time, but we're probably going to use more of this time, iPads and iPhones. But we've done that in the past. But as far as the D-Triple C, the difference between D-Triple C and NRCC over the last few years, two years ago, they were very active. And even in 12, they did try to get Blong Zhang through over John Hernandez. And they actually spent quite a bit of money, but they weren't able to get him across. This has been the least active the D-Triple C has ever been in my race. Yeah, and folks are talking about that. And less than 90 days, is your opponent going to be able to put the team together? Less than 80 days from last week. It was 77, because it's 76 today. I'm counting down the days. You're counting down, like we said, the calendar too. So can he put that campaign together? And then one question I always like to ask is, you know, how important vote by mail will be? Because the things that you talked about, you know, the election starts actually, you know, on Facebook, in a month, folks will start voting. So are you also going to add on, I know you do a great VBM campaign, continuing to do what you did best. And then just depending on you being out there, your staff being out there. And especially a more of a presence on partial to Kern County. More of a president's presence in Kern County, because your opponent is from Kern County. So, yes, we're doing everything. The one thing we are doing different this year that we hadn't done in the past is we never stopped our campaign wing, never stopped. So after the election was over, we continued to call and reach out and talk to voters throughout the whole process. So we did do that differently this year, so we have ID voters a little bit better. During the primary, we just weren't as active. We weren't chasing, we weren't calling as much, and we weren't walking. Was that because you were just waiting to see if it was par, you really didn't, to be honest, have to put in that many resources versus aware that maybe some Republican resources were used to bump par up. So that's why you kind of stayed behind or didn't do as much in the primary. We didn't do as much, we felt pretty comfortable we were going to make it through. And we wanted to save resources. No, not you, that you were just watching us see who would make it through. We, me, I was also looking to make sure we save resources for the general because that's where the fight's going to be. Right. And the one thing that's happened nationally that a lot of folks will seem that don't realize is there are 435 seats in Congress. And to assume that the Democrat Party, the Republican Party has the resources to just go dump all these different resources, all these races. California is not a state that can swing. So the members of Congress who are in tough districts in Colorado, Florida, Virginia, and those types of states are the ones that they're going to really fill a lot of heat. Because the presidential races will just be beating down their districts, trying to get voters out. And then they're going to be somewhere in the mix trying to stay, keep their heads above water and not get drowned out in that noise. And our situation is a little bit different. And you have the finances. You're very healthy with your fundraising. You raise a lot of good money. And so that's going to help you also as you move the campaign in less than 70 days, right? We have a lot of supporters in the district. And so I guess the question for me is that we see the same patterns again. Do you think there's going to be a different election that you've seen? Because there's some things that can make it different to this year. Yes. You talked about the John Hernandez race. And that one, you outperformed him in the district the first time you ran. But he spent less than $100,000. He's spent nothing. And so you know, with the resources you had, you're going to stomp him. And then last race, it was $1.7 million that she raised. And then vice president and then celebrities like Eva Longoria campaign. And then Hillary Clinton raised her money for her in San Francisco. So yeah, we've had some, we've had some interesting races. If your question is, is Am I nervous? And am I running a race because I know I'm in a real race? Yes. We are always nervous. We always run like we're behind. And we always focus on doing our job right at this point on the campaign wing. We're not taking anything for granted. Right. So we're running a full race. I think that's a healthy attitude because Nicole and I have been through probably more campaigns than we carry the count. They're easy though. How races? If you're not running from behind, you're going to lose. And I think that's a healthy perspective to have. Well, and Nicole knows it. Nicole has been through some of these exact kinds of races twice. But you have Kevin McCarthy on your side. That's always a good thing, especially the resources he can make. That's a good thing. Yeah. He plays a good basketball. Right. Oh, does he? I don't think he invited me to play on the congressional basketball team this year, or this past year because he thinks I'm better than him. Oh, well, there we go. Hopefully he's listening. Because I'm still offended I didn't get asked back. All right. Well, that's it for today. Thank you so much for coming in. It was great talking to you and learning a little more about your family and your background and what it means to you to be in Congress and talk to us about the race, which is going to be fantastic. You're not exciting. I love this season. That's great. And thank you to Russ and Nicole. And tune in next week to After Press. We will have Corey Woodward for Judge candidate on Tuesday. And Jim Bloomquist, I believe her name is in the for a city school district seat on Thursday. So again, After Press, we'll catch you next week. And thank you so much for being here. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Joining us now is Republican Congressman from California, David Valeday. He's a member of the House Appropriations and Budget Committee. So he's been in the thick of the spending process throughout the course of this year. Certainly, the deadline is approaching. Sir, you're not considered a firebrand. You're not considered a show horse type on Capitol Hill. As you look at things right now behind the scenes, is there going to be a shutdown in 10 days? Well, we really hope not. Obviously, there's a lot of us who are working behind the scenes trying to find a way to make this get through. But as you all saw yesterday, there was about five members that voted against their party and sadly, we're getting closer and closer to that day. You know, to that point, you said something you quoted earlier this week where you were talking about the appropriations process, the committee and the work that they've done, and they basically made the point. They're not even willing to support a defense appropriations bill. That's supposed to be the easy one. To that point, did you ever think you'd be in a place where Republicans wouldn't be able to coalesce behind a Republican defense spending bill? No, this one is a totally new one for us and obviously it's frustrating for all of us. I think a lot of that frustration has filtered out. I know there was a lot behind closed doors, but certainly we've heard some publicly. Your colleague, Congressman Mike Lawler, has been very clear about his use, but I want to play, you heard him earlier. I want to play something else, he said. Listen. This is not conservative Republicanism. This is stupidity. The idea that we're going to shut the government down. When we don't control the Senate, we don't control the White House. These people can't define a win. They don't know how to take yes for an answer. It's a clown show. You keep running lunatics. You're going to be in this position. You're not known to be as fiery and how you describe your colleagues, but to that point, do you agree? Is his assessment spot on in the reality right now? No, the reality is I think there are some members that probably will never ever get to a yes, and I think we went into that knowing that, but we have to go through the motions. We have to try to pass the bills. Obviously they keep talking about continuing to move appropriations bills, but the same people who are saying that are the ones voting against the rule to bring the appropriations bills to the floor. If we can't move appropriations bills to the floor, we have no other option. It's put in a position where as the day gets closer, we're going to have to start working across the aisle and find some folks who are willing to support any sort of funding mechanism so that we don't hurt our military. We don't hurt the American people. I think that's got a lot of us really, really frustrated right now. To that point, there's been some reporting, my colleagues, Melonies and Ona, and Mono Raju reporting that there have been discussions, some quiet discussions between Republicans and Democrats about whether or not to coalesce or if there's a pathway to coalesce now before going through the six or seven more motions you would need to go through to get to that point. Are you a part of those conversations? Do you think something like that would work? I do believe it could work. It just depends on what's on the table, what's being asked for. Obviously we're at $33 trillion in debt right now, and spending is a big deal for a lot of us at home, and it's something that we want to try to be as responsible as we possibly can on. But again, when you can't get those five remaining five out of the 217 that voted yesterday, five of them voted against us, voted against our military, and it's kind of left us in a position where we're going to have to start negotiating a little earlier with the other side than we expected. Are you worried, are you concerned about Speaker McCarthy's job at this point? You supported him? No, obviously I'm a big supporter of the Speaker. I think he's done a great job. I don't believe anyone could have done better. The first thing an ask of him is something that's just not attainable, and no matter what he does, there's going to be criticism. The problem is, is there's such a small majority that there are in a position where they can play the types of games that you see yesterday. Dropping pieces of legislation on the bathroom countertop, these are just childish games. The reality is we have to govern, and for Republicans to be successful and get our priorities forward, funding our military, making sure that we're responsible, taxpayer dollars, making sure that we do everything we need to do, that we promise that our constituent we would do, we have to pass bills. And just voting no is not how you do that. One more before I let you go. You've long been a frontline member. You've won races, you've lost races. All of your races have been tough with a lot of spending on both sides from outside, and on your campaign. You have supported the impeachment inquiry, the launch of the impeachment inquiry. Are you concerned about what that will do to you politically given kind of the race? The races you tend to end up in. So no matter what I do, I'm going to get attacked. So worrying about what attacks are going to come from the left or the right. The reality is I can't focus on that. The races that I've run and won and lost, obviously they're frustrating, they're hard to go through. But as I've proven before, I'm not afraid to make tough decisions even when it's against my own party. But obviously what we see going on in the White House and some of the situations with this son are extremely concerning. And I think the reality is I think America have to have trust in their elected leadership. And this might be part of the process to getting to that point where we can actually trust our leadership. And right now Joe Biden is the one under the spotlight and I think it's deservedly so. I think you guys are under the spotlight too, at least for the next 10 days as well. Congressman Dave Valdeau, we appreciate your time sir. Thank you. Anytime. Thanks for having me.",

        "transcript": " Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask your support for a very simple amendment to the bill we're considering today. This amendment would shift $25 million of funding from Department of Justice General Funds to the DEA for the express purpose of enforcing federal law on the illegal cultivation of marijuana. This is an enormous issue for my district. And to be clear, we're not talking about a few people growing plants in their backyard. These are hundreds of acres with hundreds of thousands of plants. And also to be clear, we're not talking about legal cultivation of marijuana. Marijuana cultivation is legal in my home state. It is legal in several of the different jurisdictions that I represent. But we're talking about illegal cultivation of marijuana. And the problem with this is the folks who are willing to break the one law in cultivating marijuana illegally are willing to break many more laws. And it's causing an enormous stress on the people that I represent. These grows, it would boggle your mind if you saw the scale of these grows. These grows are bulldozed in the middle of the desert. They're surrounded by a 10 foot high bulldozed, earthen berm with a gate on the front. And the reason for the berm is not to keep people out. It is to keep people in. The majority of the workers at these grows are trafficked across the border. It is a human catastrophe. These people are forced to work here as slaves. They are working with stolen water. We estimate that about 3 million gallons a day of water is stolen to operate these grows just in the state of California. They're stealing power, megawatts of power. And they're also using band pesticides that are legal nowhere in California. In fact, nowhere in the United States. These pesticides are so toxic, in fact, that the law enforcement officers who have destroyed the plants involved in some of these grows have come up with full body rashes afterwards as a result of these toxins. And unfortunately, the wash off those toxins winds up in the groundwater. So this is a catastrophe for everyone involved, including the folks who are trying to follow the law and pursue legal marijuana cultivation. And unfortunately, local law enforcement agencies are completely overwhelmed. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department currently estimates we have 800 of these grows that we're tracking just in that one county. And they estimate with the current workload that they have and the personnel they have to devote to the problem. It's going to take them three years to work through it. And this is a crop whose commercial lifetime is three months. So I hope you're going to appreciate the problem. This is a modest investment in federal enforcement for this law. And this problem, it's appropriate for the federal government to get involved. It's just going to shift from one district to another as these criminal enterprises shift from one place to another. So it's a common sense and a very modest solution to a very serious problem. And I'd like to respectfully request your support for this amendment. I yield back. And forgive me, Texas, that activity is not legal. So I wouldn't know the difference between a legal grow and an illegal grow, they're all illegal. So how do you identify? Well, what is the parameters that are followed or not followed for an illegal grow? So thank you for the question, Congressman. So in California, Proposition 64, which is the law that legalized the cultivation of marijuana, allowed each individual local jurisdiction to determine whether or not cultivation would be legal there. So in my district, I represent 13 cities. Two cities have made it legal. And the county has made it illegal, which means that in unincorporated areas, it's legal. So it's only legal in two of the 13 cities I represent. But also in California, there's a very strict framework that comes along with illegalization. Individual plants are tracked from birth to death. The product is tracked. There are taxes, fees and fees pays at each stage of the licensure. So it's very clear who's doing it legally and who's doing it illegally. But the other thing that look for is the scale. The illegal grows are a much larger scale than the legal grows. Individual illegal grows can be hundreds of acres and hundreds of thousands of plants. And that's why it's such a catastrophe for the people who live in the neighborhoods where these grows are located because over half of them are controlled by international cartels. According to law enforcement, my constituents have been shot at. My constituents have been harassed. They don't feel safe in their own homes. And in California, unfortunately, illegal cultivation at any scale is merely a misdemeanor. And that's why it's up to the DEA to enforce this, because the DEA has tools that local law enforcement can't bring to bear without tying it to a larger crime such as money laundering. So for example, wire tap authorizations can't be pursued by local law enforcement. They could be pursued by the DEA. So let me ask this if I could and I appreciate your answer. Is asset forfeiture ever invoked with any of these illegal grows if it's a federal law that's violated? That is another tool that the DEA can use that local law enforcement cannot, because unfortunately, California State Law, because this is only a misdemeanor that we're talking about. They can't even bulldoze the hot houses. They make shift greenhouses that are housing these plants, because the people that own the house could then bring a suit against law enforcement claiming the illegal destruction of property. The only thing that they can do is physically destroy the plants.",

        "transcript": " Congressman Obernolte, a president Biden's announcement that U.S. airspace would be closed to all Russian flights, brought Democrats and Republicans to their feet during the State of the Union address. It's another one of the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and our allies on Russia and the wake of its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Is the U.S. doing enough? And how would you assess President Biden's handling of this situation? Well, I was very happy to hear the president talk about closing airspace. It's something that we that I personally have been advocating for over the last couple of days. And certainly the vast majority of Congress joins the president in supporting strong economic sanctions against Russia to disincentivize the kind of behavior that they're exhibiting. However, there are a lot of us myself included who feel that the president has not gone far enough in some areas of the economic sanctions. In particular, the energy sector is currently exempted. And that's Russia's biggest export is oil and natural gas, and it's their biggest source of foreign currency. So if we really intend for these sanctions to be taken seriously, we have to include the energy sector. The reason why I think the administration has avoided that is it's a political conundrum for them. If we include energy in the sanctions against Russia, that's going to drive up U.S. energy costs for American consumers even more than they already have been. And the only solution for that is something that the administration has staunchly opposed over the last 18 months, which is increasing domestic energy production. So that's what I think that the president really needs to do. We need to start encouraging more U.S. domestic energy production that will decrease our reliance on foreign energy and allow us to institute the sanctions that I really think are needed. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said this in the Republican Rebuttal to President Biden State of the Union address, quote, weakness on the world stage has a cost. And the president's approach to foreign policy has consistently been too little too late. But Republicans have been criticized for seeming to be siding with Russia and President Putin. At least in the days leading up to the invasion, some prominent conservatives suggested that U.S. and NATO support of Ukraine effectively provoked Russia into attacking. Former President Trump even said it was a, quote, smart move by President Putin to send what Mr. Trump called, quote, the strongest piece force I've ever seen to the Ukraine border before the invasion. Do you agree with former President Trump? Was he right when he described Mr. Putin's actions as genius in the run-up to the invasion? Well, if you want to see what the sense of Congress is, all you have to do is look at that section of the state of the Union speech last night. It really had the strongest bipartisan support. And when you saw the entire Congress on its feet applauding, I mean, a very rare standing ovation for the president's, the president's conviction to stand by Ukraine and oppose Russia for his strong language about Vladimir Putin. You know, I think it's pretty clear that this is a broad bipartisan issue and it's pretty clear the sense of where both parties are on this issue. Now, I think what you had a very good point about the fact that weakness in foreign policy encourages behavior like the behavior that Russia has been exhibiting. And I think that that's, people on both sides of the aisle will agree that's fair criticism of the president's foreign policy, particularly as regards the disastrous handling of the pull out from Afghanistan. I think everyone agrees that that was a catalyst in encouraging the kind of behavior that you're seeing from Russia today. President Biden's a state of the Union address to your point did bring some rare bipartisan comedy to the Congress. Something we haven't seen for a long time. There were moments, and as you said, when both Democrats and Republicans were applauding, especially with regard to the response to the Russian invasion. But Republicans, a Marjory Taylor Greene and Lauren Bobert heckled the president during his address. One of the disruptions happened as the president urged legislation to help war veterans affected by toxins in Iraq and Afghanistan. Among them, the president's late son who died of brain cancer. Is that kind of behavior just the way it is now in Congress? Well, I hope not. I've only been in Congress now for two years. As you know, I was in the California State Legislature for six years. And I think that we set a different tone in California. I think that it's a tone that accepts the fact that there is room for bipartisan debate on issues that we disagree on. And it can be done respectfully and professionally. So I hope that that's not the tone. But also, I think it's important to realize how emotional a topic this is for a lot of people. You know, myself included, there are a lot of people in Congress who feel like the death of those 13 service members last year in Kabul was completely avoidable and was a direct result of the way that the withdrawal from Afghanistan was handled. And so I think that that's what you're seeing when you saw those comments last night. Finally, you've introduced a HR 6434, a bill aiming to protect the history of Americans of Japanese descent who are incarcerated in internment camps during World War II. One of the sites. One of the camps, man's and are in your district, the bill recently passed committee. It awaits a full house vote, full disclosure. I'm Japanese American. I've been involved in efforts to make sure no one forgets this ugly chapter in our history. But why has this become so important to you? Well, part of it is that we celebrate anniversaries to make sure that the memories of these events don't fade. And last month, we celebrated a very unfortunate anniversary. The 80th anniversary of one FDR signed the executive order that created these incarceration camps and ordered the involuntarily voluntary confinement of over 100,000 Japanese Americans in the United States. In retrospect, it was a terribly sad chapter in our national history. And we teach that the reason for studying histories to make sure that something like this can never happen again. So what I'm trying to do with that bill is to create a historic network to celebrate these camps within the national park system. We have existing networks for things like the Underground Railroad and the Civil Rights Movement. And I'd like to create one for Japanese American World War II history just to raise awareness of this. And obviously, one of the best preserves of these camps is within my congressional district. It's in Manzanar. It's a beautiful place, but terribly, terribly remote, a very harsh climate. And anyone that visits there will instantly see the horrible conditions that these Japanese Americans were forced to live in and how terribly wrong the action of the United States was. So I'm very honored that so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree with the need to preserve this history. As you said, this was passed out with broad bipartisan support out of the Natural Resources Committee a couple of weeks ago. And hopefully within the next week or two, we'll get a vote on the full house floor about this bill. Representative Jay Obernolte will be tracking that one along with other things that you're doing. Sir, thanks very much for your time. Absolutely. It's always an honor.",

        "transcript": " Well, thank you. I thank the member for yielding and Madam Speaker. I stand deeply concerned today about the state of our economy. Last week, the Department of Labor released the latest statistics for inflation in the United States. It shows that inflation continues to occur here at a rate above 8%, a 40-year high. Even more alarmingly, the Department of Labor says that core inflation has increased in August over the month of July, and that real wages have declined 3.4% on an annualized basis. What that means is that my constituents cannot buy the same quantity of the things that they need this year as they could last year, even if they got a right raise for the labor that they produce. Madam Speaker, I hear every single day from constituents who are desperate because of the results of this inflation. And imagine my embarrassment when I have to tell them that this inflation was caused by the actions of their own federal government. Economists have already answered the question of why we're experiencing this inflation. It's a combination of several things. As our economy emerges from the pandemic, there's been an increased demand for goods and services, and a constrained supply chain, which restricts our ability to respond to that increased demand. An economist will say that will make prices go up. But the other thing that has occurred is that this federal government has dumped almost $5 trillion of excess government spending into our economy over the last 18 months, $5 trillion to give you an idea of how big that number is in context. Normally, our federal government only spends about $5 trillion in a given year. So we are increasingly increasing government spending by a rate of almost double that of the normal rate. And Madam Speaker, when that occurs, you put even more pressure on goods and services and that causes prices to increase further. Earlier this year, the San Francisco branch of the Federal Reserve Bank wondered why inflation was so much worse here in the United States than that experienced by other countries, particularly in Europe. So they did a study and several months ago they released the results of this study. And they have findings were stark. They said that deficit government spending is at the root cause of why inflation is so much worse here in the United States than it is in other countries. Madam Speaker, when the actions of government result in people paying more, that's called attacks. And inflation in the United States represents an unseen tax paid by every single American family. And unfortunately, this is a tax that is born disproportionately by those who can least afford to pay it, the impoverished and the working poor in this country. But I have an even deeper concern this evening, Madam Speaker. Several weeks ago, the Congressional Budget Office released their long-term fiscal forecast in which they analyze the finances of the United States over the next 30 years. They do this every year and Congress, frankly, never pays attention. Well, Madam Speaker, Congress and the American people need to start paying attention to what the CBO has to say. The CBO says that our current national debt stands at over $30 trillion. If you do the math, that is over $90,000 for every single American man, woman, and child, over $90,000 each. And that's today. The CBO says that right now our federal government runs a deficit of about 30 percent of all federal spending. That represents about 4 percent of our gross domestic product. But at the end of the forecast period, the CBO says that our deficit will nearly triple to 11 percent of our GDP. At that time, just paying interest on the national debt will eclipse all of our federal spending on Social Security. It will eclipse all of our federal spending on Medicare. In fact, it will become the single largest expenditure of federal government requiring over half of all federal tax revenue to pay over half. And that's under the current fiscal conditions. Ironically, the Federal Reserve Bank is being forced to raise interest rates as a result of the inflation that this federal government has caused. Every time the Fed takes the action that they are likely to take this week and raising the discount rate by three quarters of a point, it increases the cost of our interest payments on our national debt by $180 billion a year, a year, which makes the problem even worse. In fact, the CBO says that if the Federal Reserve is forced to raise interest rates by three percentage points, and we know that they've already gotten about halfway there, that by the end of their forecast period, just paying interest on the national debt will consume over 100 percent of federal tax revenues. In other words, as a federal government, as a federal government, we won't even have enough money to pay the interest on the debt that we have rung up. That is unacceptable. This should be something that everyone in this chamber is talking about. Because what the CBO says is that sometime in the next 30 years, there will come a day of reckoning. And the sooner it comes, the less painful it will be. But if we wait, it will be extremely painful. Man and Speaker, we must get our fiscal house in order. And the only way to solve this problem is to reduce our habit of deficit spending. Now, I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to say, this is an easily solved problem. The problem is that we don't tax Americans enough while the CBO had an answer to that too. They said that over the next 30 years, in their forecast period, average federal tax revenues will be over 18 percent. That is well in, that is a substantial increase over the current federal tax revenue over the last 50 years. In other words, Man and Speaker, what we have is not a revenue problem. We have a spending problem. And the only way we can get this problem under control is to reduce our federal spending and control our deficit. Man and Speaker, almost every year in this chamber, multiple bills are introduced, attempting to impose a balanced budget requirement, sometimes within our house rules, sometimes within our federal constitution. I myself introduced a balanced budget amendment last year in this chamber. We try to do it in a responsible way that won't disrupt the economy. We do it over a five-year phasing period. We allow for periods of fiscal emergency to be declared in which the President with the concurrence of Congress can override the requirement that the federal budget be balanced in times of warfare and times of economic crisis. But Man and Speaker, we must pay attention to this problem. We must balance our federal budget. If we do not, not only us, but our children will pay the terrible consequence. I yield back.",

        "transcript": " Two more police officers shot and wounded early this morning while serving a search warrant in Georgia. It's an incident which left the suspected attacker dead. There's been a recent alarming wave of shootings targeting police officers. It's a record numbers of cops fatally shot on the job this year alone. My next guest is saying, you know what, that's inspired him to introduce a new bill that would make any attack on law enforcement, a hate crime in the state of California. He is Republican state assembly, UJ over an OT program now. Sir, thanks for joining us on the show. Can you tell us a little bit about the bill and the history of it just quickly? Well, certainly. Last July, I was very alarmed to hear about the five police officers in Dallas that were basically assassinated just as a result of their profession. There were five others that were seriously wounded. And then just 10 days later in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, three more police officers were gunned down. And that really inspired me to raise awareness of this issue by introducing assembly bill two, which would add the status as a peace officer to the list of things that constitute a hate crime in California. Mr. O'Blaner, the criticism has been that, you know, the class of the groups of people that are protected under the hate crime laws. They're vulnerable. Cops can defend themselves. They have weapons. What do you say to that criticism? Well, I don't think it makes much sense to me. If you look at the definition of a hate crime, it's a crime in which the victim is chosen not out of specific animosity towards them as an individual, but rather out of hostility towards the entire group that they represent. And if you look at the, these ambush style police attacks in the last year, they fit the very definition of what a hate crime is and what it's, we're supposed to be protecting against. So a number of states, I think, are picking up on this, right? Yes, you're right. There was a law passed in Louisiana just recently that adds status as a peace officer to what constitutes a hate crime. That's what we're trying to do in California. So this is sort of like the blue lives matters legislation, right? You're in that kind of group, right? That's accurate. So how is, what has been the reaction to the state of California to your bill? It's been almost universally positive. All the law enforcement agencies are certainly in favor of it, but I think anyone that recognizes the value of the rule of law in the United States isn't favor of it because if you think about it, an attack on a police officer is an attack on the rule of law, which is really an attack on the very basis of our society. What's the extra penalty if your bill passes? It becomes a hate crime in the state of California to assault a police officer? What would the, or kill? What would the extra penalties be? Well, if you're also charged under California's hate crime law, it would depend on what the underlying offense was, but in general for a felony, would add one to three years in state prison for the commission of that crime. And it's also important to note that this is not any assault on a peace officer that would be covered. This is only assaults that are targeted specifically against police officers because they are police officers. So for example, the two peace officers in Georgia earlier today that were shot, you know, certainly deplorable, certainly something that we would dislike, but not a hate crime when they're, when they're injured in the course of their duties. Assemblyman, Mr. Earl Bonoert, thank you so much for having us, for being on the show and bringing us the story. Come back with the update.",

        "transcript": " Now to an in-depth look at one of the candidates vying for Lois Caps' Congressional seat, Democratic candidate Salud Carbohal. He is taking on Republican Justin Fareed. Last night, we heard from the Republican. Tonight, News Channel 3's Elise Martinez sits down with Carbohal, who thinks he is the right choice. For the past 12 years, Salud Carbohal has served as first district supervisor in Santa Barbara County. I think my legacy is one that my office provided exemplary constituent service to all the residents of my district, whether they were emails, letters, phone calls, or meetings or visits to my office. He was born in Mexico and came to this country with his family, working in the fields of Oxnard. He graduated from UCSB and served as United States Marine. And now he wants to take all of those experiences to Washington. My number one concern is making sure that working middle class families here on the Central Coast have opportunities, economic opportunities that will help them advance and prosper. In addition to that, of course, addressing climate change and offshore oil development as well. We'll talk more later. In TV ads, Carbohal's opponent Republican Justin Fareed says he'll bring fresh ideas and fresh energy to Congress. Unlike my opponent, I should say, I have never worked in Washington. But Carbohal says he'll be the one reaching across the aisles. I've worked in a bipartisan way with all my colleagues to accomplish quite a bit of public policy that brings about many solutions to the challenges our community has faced. For making sure we have the highest rainy day reserved in the county's history, to making sure that we balance our budget each and every year, that we have invested in our infrastructure, our roads and parks, and that we've provided for the safety net for our seniors, our children, the poor, the indigent in our communities, and I'm very proud of that service. If elected, Carbohal says he wants to get to work right away. In the first 100 days, obviously other than getting situated, I will be moving forward legislation to stop offshore oil development off our coast. I will also be looking at legislation to require background checks on all purchases of guns in our country and to make sure that we do everything possible to ban assault rifles for our communities. Recently, Carbohal found himself under fire after being overheard referring to Lompoke as the armpit of Santa Barbara County. I have apologized and will apologize again. That comment certainly was taken out of context, but I have apologized for whatever context and mischaracterization that was provided. The supervisor says he has and always will be a strong advocate for Lompoke. I am proud of my work for Lompoke to provide resources for infrastructure, to make sure that the school's aquarium has the funding and needs, and I am also proud of having work to get resources for the veterans building. And when you're still out there, let you do it. You can do anything. Whatever you want. Grab them by the f***. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sexually charged comments about women prompted and even deeper divide between the candidates, with Carbohal calling on Farid to denounce Trump on Twitter. When Donald Trump spoke out in degraded women time and time again, my opponent Justin Farid stood with him. When Donald Trump degraded gold star families and veterans, my opponent stood with him. When Donald Trump degraded Mexican Americans, we called him criminals. My opponent stood chest to chest with him. As voters mark their ballots, Carbohal hopes he will be their choice. I am pro-choice and believe in women's reproductive rights. My opponent is pro-life and does not believe in women's reproductive rights. There's a real contrast in this election. And I think the voters are going to have an opportunity to vote somebody who represents central coast values in Washington as their next representative. With just weeks to go before election day, Salud Carbohal says he will be campaigning down to the wire, making phone calls, knocking on doors and meeting with as many people as possible until November 8th. In Santa Barbara, I'm Elise Martinez reporting.",

        "transcript": " Of course, a good question. Good. Justin Farid is the third generation cattle rancher, business man, and a Santa Barbara native who grew up building a small business with his family. He's running for Congress to bring what he says is a true voice for the Central Coast to Washington DC and to get Congress working again through the new leadership and 21st century solutions. One big clap for. Thank you so much. I apologize. I need to advance. I'm having a question. I have a cup there. Okay. All right. We're going to have opening remarks from each of the candidates. You have one minute to tell us a little bit about yourself and why you're running for us. Justin, you go first, please. Well, Kristen, I'm Kristen, the Felita Chamber. I can't tell you how grateful I am to have the opportunity to be here to address everyone in this room. I'm a proud homeowner here in Felita. It was born in race with Santa Barbara. There was organizations like this that helped our family build a business to take a vision and turn it into reality. It was the hard work to grind the effort, the ingenuity, the innovation that got us to where we are today. You know, manufacturing here locally and distributing now. National building this business from scratch and out of our garage. I'm proud to have had the background and entrepreneurship and that being the backbone of my family and my life. It's that same type of mentality that I'm working to bring forward to the United States Congress to get Congress work and to get for the American people for the future of this country. Look forward to continuing this discussion. Thank you. Very good. So look, I'm thinking of opening remarks. Thank you, Keith, and thank you, Kristen and the Felita Chamber for this opportunity. As you read, I'm a son of a working family, working class family. My father was a minor, then a farm worker. I'm proud to have been the first in my family to go to a four-year university, work my way through college. I'm proud to have had a long public service record, starting with my years in the United States Marine Corps. And my years, my past 12 years, working in the county government. I'm proud of having worked in a white partisan way to achieve many solutions to the problems our community has faced. We have the highest rainy day reserved in the county's history. The highest bond credit rating in the state of California. We have invested $100 million over the next 10 years in our infrastructure. We've given, we've provided health insurance to many needy children here in our county. I'm proud of that bipartisan record. I know what it's like to struggle from my own personal story. I want to go to Congress to make sure that every working middle class family has the same opportunities. Thank you, sir. We're going to have three questions, a four-manager you've used to by now. Gentlemen, for the first all three questions, you'll have two minutes for your response and watch your coordinate there for your two is to win the stop. Question number one, we're back to water again. Every one of you needs to be asked about physical start with water. California, as you know, as a state mandates water reduction of water consumption. It's resulted in higher rates and water rights taken from some property owners. Let's start with saloon when asked if you, what can you do with here in Washington to help this region's water problem from back there in the nation's capital? Thank you. Well, the most important thing Washington can do is really to provide incentives so that local jurisdictions can work together. Perfayers, we're all fragmented as a perfayer community throughout the central coast and throughout the state. We need to be able to come together to put together water security plans. Water security plans that address conservation that provide for reuse and recycle more effectively, that provide for recharge and that look at decolonization in a regional way. But right now, some forms of government are not part of that solution because they're not perfayers. But what we need to do is spur that collaborative discussion amongst all perfayers to come up with such a plan. The federal government could also provide funding for the infrastructure to make sure that communities are incentivized and provided the resources so they could bring about better facilities to address this water crisis. This water crisis is a result of climate change and I will do everything possible in Washington to make sure that we bring the resources to the central coast and that we're doing everything possible to address climate change. Thank you very much, Justin, two minutes. Thank you. Do you read in your introduction of me? My number one goal is to be a servant leader for the folks here on the central coast to Washington DC. And therefore, this has been my number one issue through the Corsus and the entire campaign. Where we are today is a lack of foresight from passing current politicians and investment directly in infrastructure and things that yield a return for taxpayers. As somebody grew up in the private sector building a business, it's necessary that we make investments in things that actually yield a return that don't raise rates and fees on families around the central coast because that adversely affects our bottom line. We need solutions and solutions means we need water. We need to make investments in 21st century technologies like desalination, water treatment facilities, and increasing capacity and reservoirs in the long term so that during white years we have the ability to store water. We need a long range of water policy in California and on the central coast. It's my goal to be steer to the transportation infrastructure to the midi and specifically the subcommittee on water and the environment. Through this we will be able to move forward to streamline the process of public and private partnerships, to leverage that to ensure that we do get those investments. That's my passion. We need to do is we need long-range solutions for water. It will help all the folks who spoke here before and something that I will work to do my first year as your representative. Thank you. In the second question which will be business and economic development related to us and we will leave with you. All over the state it's no great surprise that people in business who have to do with government to learn that businesses are leaving California at an alarming rate and are taking high quality employees, young and experienced. This is a very heavy burden that is placed upon business people. I love your passion. I want to have a call. No, I am passionate. I seek to have any businesses struggle. We feel that every single day is that business people here on the central coast come in and firstly affects the job climate here on the central coast for the stargabons, the North visionaries. Those that are graduating from college that are looking to manifest the vision that they created to people like yourself in this room who have worked to build a model here in California that employs people like creates jobs that improves the economic vitality of the area. It's difficult when you have regulatory arms and unelected bureaucrats that are imposing and essentially legislating from the federal level. There are policies that adversely affect the business community and our economic vitality. That's why it's necessary for Congress to get working again for the American people and doing their duty and their job and the responsibility of legislating, get back to governing, rein in the regulatory burdens from the executive branch that are adversely affecting small businesses throughout our community to create more economic growth, more jobs, more revenue moving forward. We want to happen to sunset mandates to bring forward policies that were created in the past to be reviewed back before Congress. Once again, to separate the bathroom and go to see what's working, what's not working on the economic impassure support policies like the Reigns Act where if there is any regulation that is issued out that has potential economic impact of over $100 million on our community, it has to come before Congress up and down. It's important that we have people that are connected to folks that are being adversely affected by these regulations to have that voice for us in the United States Congress once again so that we can improve the policies that are affecting us, not unelected bureaucrats. Salute to 10 scariest words in English language are I'm from the federal government and I'm here to help. Does there anything you think you could do back in Washington? Let me start, let me start keep by reminding you that we're still the Golden State and we're the sex largest economy in the world and many people still desire to come to the Central Coast because we are a very special community. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Everybody knows that and the best thing the federal government can do is make sure that small businesses have access more access to capital so that our businesses could flourish and create more jobs. We need to make sure that we are providing tax relief to small businesses so that they can better prosper in our community. We need to make sure that we are investing the federal government to invest with the state of California local communities like ours to make sure that broadband continues to flourish in our area to help our economic engines. We need to make sure that we're also investing in new employment sectors such as renewable energy and employment sectors to make sure that we transition to renewable energy economy and that we train those fossil fuel employees that are going to come to the EU. More importantly, we need to make sure that we are providing grant resources to the two most important universities in our area, UCSB and Cal Poly. We need to make sure that they're getting the support so they can continue to flourish and turn out a skilled educated workforce so that our businesses could flourish locally and have that employment pool that they so depend on. That's what the federal government could do for our area. Thank you, sir. Speaking of federal government will be our last question and this again is a two-minute response. So we will go first. I have a lobbyist friend in Washington that says that city is 535 bulls in search of a china shop. I think you look at the house and the senate. There's dysfunction back there. Can you do anything as a freshman member of Congress to maybe help break the gridlock and eliminate dysfunction? And how would you go about it? Thank you very much. First of all, I've never worked in Washington. But let me tell you what I have done. Locally in my service in county government, I've been able to work across the aisle. Again, we've done some really great things in a bipartisan way. The highest rainy day we've invested in our infrastructure. We've provided health care to children. We've developed a true and C program in a bipartisan way with our schools, the district attorney. We went from 4,000 to 2,000 children to less than 50 needing an intervention. I have a track record of working across the aisle developing those relationships to get things done. And I hope to be able to go to Washington to do the same thing that I've done in my public service in a county government to achieve that common ground and the relationships you need to forge to collaborate on legislation. So that we move the ball forward and we don't focus on party, but we focus on how to bring about solutions for the American people, for our country, to get beyond this partisanship that we have all come to be tested. Thank you. Justin, if you agree with the premise that there's a gridlock and dysfunction back there, what could you do about a freshman member of Congress? This ultimately is the reason why I decided to run for Congress. I did serve in Washington DC under a senior member of Congress. There's my responsibility to observe and assess how public policy was adversely affecting our country and circumstances. What I found is that there is a lot of empty rhetoric. There is a zero sum game of water takeoff between either political party and the biggest losers in this equation is the rest of this country and the future of this country. It's just as bad as you think. Do you say that working across the aisle and nonpartisan board supervisors of five gives you credentials to a servant body that has 535 members is kind of not even my opinion. What you have is a number of folks that are more concerned about their next election and the other policies that affect the rest of this country. We need a Congress that works for us. We need to reform it systemically. The baseline there is the budget. The second biggest priority outside of representing constituency is the budget. The budget is the budget. You oversight and management of taxpayer dollars and how those dollars are being spent. We need to approve on this. The leader has a buy-in-your-budget system, a material budget system. This is something that we should implement in Congress to provide better oversight and management and create a greater discourse and debate on how those dollars are being spent. We ensure that people are actually yielding a return on those dollars. It will actually improve the discourse and reduce the partisanship. We need to move to a single subject rule in Congress so that every single policy that is ever voted on is only relative to that one. We ensure that we mitigate the politics that is associated with the policy and get back to governing. These are policies that need to be implemented into the institution of Congress to get it working again for the American people for the future of this country. It will strengthen the institution and give us voices that will work for us. Thank you very much. It is a wrap-up time for each of you. You have one quick minute again to wrap-up. Just so we are going to have you give your closing comments. What do you want the crowd to hear? Again, I appreciate the opportunity to be here today. I am honored and grateful. I am humbled by the opportunity to have the responsibility on my shoulders to represent all of you in the United States Congress. This election is going to be the most important election that we have had here on the Central Coast in over two decades. It will determine the future of governance not only here on the Central Coast but in the United States Congress. Given what has happened, we have to take it. What we need more than anything is a functional Congress that is working for the American people again today. That is my goal and my focus is to get that body working for us about we can create a leaner, more efficient, more effective institution for the American people that create economic growth and more jobs for the future to make investments that yield a return for tax-corp payers here and now and for the future. I am very much focused on doing what's right for us on the Central Coast. It has never been about whether it be blue to me. This is about making a difference in a positive impact. Thank you and God bless all of you. Thank you, Chester. Thank you very much. Well, I really appreciate it going up and down on the Central Coast and meeting with residents from all walks of life and hearing what is important to them. I hope to be able to earn their trust and their vote so that I can represent them on Congress. I think when you look at my service, you have a track record of getting things done. You have a track record of working in a bipartisan way. I think that also reflect is reflective in my endorsements. The entire City Council for the City of Belida has endorsed me. Republicans and Democrats have endorsed me. I hope to be able to continue traversing the Central Coast in the remaining weeks listening what's important to them. Working hard to be accessible, to be good listener, and to provide great constituent service once I'm elected to represent Democrats. Thank you so much. And a full round of applause for that.",

        "transcript": " Herman DeFazio and welcome to both of you, former colleague Waltz and Mayor Garcetti who I had the privilege of serving with on President Obama's Climate Action Task Force. I come from local government. I served as a county supervisor for many years. So I come with that perspective. Mayor Garcetti, as you know, 45% of the nation's transportation infrastructure is owned by local governments. Today in Santa Barbara County, in my district, we have a pavement condition index of 57 out of 100. And in Santa Louis, the Bist book county, which is the other major part of my district, it's 64 PCI. Just a decade ago, the PCI in Santa Barbara County was 70. But I know we're not alone in this accelerated degradation of our infrastructure in our roads. Local governments across the nation experienced this same challenge and will continue to experience it in the future. How can we better partner with local governments to maintain a good state of repair of our nation's infrastructure? One, and two, what are the advantages and disadvantages of creating a dedicated funding source to directly allocate resources to local governments for the improvement in maintenance of local roads and bridge infrastructure in America? And I ask that from your services, a local elected official, more than anything. Absolutely. Let me start with the second one. I'm great to see you, Congressman, and thank you for your amazing service here to the country and to California. You know, it always drove me crazy. I worked now with Chairman Waters when CDBG grant dollars went out there. That's federal dollars, but always said thanks to the Councilman Blank and Mayor Blank. And we changed in Los Angeles policy, so it actually thanks the member of Congress now, because those funds come from all of you. They come from the American people first, but you enable them. And I think, you know, the idea of this road funded by the federal government, and it's a road that people are going to use 90% of the time more than an interstate highway, is a beautiful idea, and one that would be embraced, and one that there should be some sort of leverage to encourage local governments. Accelerator for America, the 501-C3 that I mentioned, we're on the ground helping folks from Florida, to Ohio, Texas, Washington, pass, local infrastructure packages on transportation. At least half of that is always for road paving. So we're stepping up to do that, and we would love to see federal government, because that network doesn't work if we don't have the feeder, first mile, last mile, roads into there, and I think there's always been the strange disconnect. Why is that not federal? And why vice versa, do we have no responsibilities for the highways that go straight through our cities, where we could put cleaning crews, we could help folks there, we could take care of graffiti. It's kind of like, don't touch that, that's either state or federal, local government does that stuff over there. So I think we would be very interested in dedicated funding resource that came to local governments, and it would be spent well, we know how to do that, and I know my number two, because we went down every year until we were 61 when I became mayor. Now we're at 68 for the first time in decades, we're going up. We've paved enough to go halfway around the world, I've got four years left, I said I want to pave the equivalent of a street all the way around the world by the time I leave as mayor. So I think that that would be very well received, and then how we can do this together, it's going to be very important for I think cities to be at the table and state. Some cities are the size of states, but for us to have that in writing this together, and the chairman's been really wonderful in inviting us to be a part of that through the National League of Cities and the US Conference of Mayors. But I think that we're going to need to see looking at streets not just as a place that you drive over them. There's people who, there's electric scooters now, there's people who walk on them, there's heat that comes off of them, there's water that goes through them, there's street trees that are important, there's curves that are important. That is a part of American infrastructure working. So we welcome the opportunity to help you co-write that, and really value your perspective as a former local official in making that happen. Thank you, mayor. To conclude, I wanted to ask if you feel that the federal government incentivizes or recognizes self-help municipalities who have taxed themselves and gone out on a limb, residents have identified these types of measures as a top priority. Does the federal government in your opinion recognize that enough? I can quote the governor, he said, no, we punish that. It's quite the opposite, actually, where we step up, and I get it. There are certain places that can't help themselves on things like water, but when people say, well, LA is a rich town, you can do that. We give 24% poverty, it's actually a high poverty town too. Poor people are voting to tax themselves to get this stuff done. So let's erase that. No, we get punished for it, not helped. We should get rewarded, not 100% because it can't leave certain places behind, but there absolutely should be. The one place where there has been good, and I hope that we can, and the legislation, move forward, is new starts, because there's been kind of a walking away in the administration from new starts. It's critically important, and there's almost a punishment. Well, you're already paying for it. If we want those subways to be open by the Olympics in 2028, when we show America off to the world, we're going to need to continue that. We expect that. We budgeted that. We are always told that, but we need to ensure it. Thank you, Mayor. I yield back my time. Thank you. We're moving.",

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to you and the ranking member Craig for having this important hearing. Mr. Cameron, you're from Paradise, also known as California, and I'm really glad that you're imparting your wisdom on the rest of our country today. I represent the central coast, which is an even focused paradise within paradise. In California, and ranking member Craig was just in my district this past weekend, and I was talking to the chairman about him visiting as well. And so I hope you enlighten him as to why he should come and have a good time and see the great agriculture in our state. Especially crops are both unique and delicate and come with many challenges. When it comes to protecting them against pests and invasive pests and disease, you mentioned in your testimony that farmers have been investing in innovation to improve methods to manage pests while reducing risks to people, property and the environment. What are some of the most effective ways this committee can support those efforts? And how can research at our local universities help specialty crop growers, adopt safer and more effective past management strategies? So, you know, we're looking at, I apologize, the first part of your question was related to that. What are some of the most effective ways this committee can support those efforts? Yep, we believe that additional money for research within California for specialty crops is imperative. Either through the IRFOR program, the FAR program, especially crop blot, block grants, working directly with universities to fund research for specialty crops. As you know in California, it's a say this, but we grow over 400 specialty crops. And we have a lot of minor crops that need attention that usually don't get the funding. The light shown on them to get results done in the field. We know that the universities are involved in many aspects of crop production. And doing research, we know that the strawberry commission does work at Cal Poly within your district. They have a great grant there. The university is very well engaged with agriculture as is UC Davis, Fresno State and some of the other minor colleges, UC Merced as well. So we know that funding is what we need. We need to be able to do the research, engage with the farmers, show them what's going on and new avenues, new ways of doing things. It's really the only way we're going to get the technology down to the grower level. We also know that University of California Extension is great for moving that information through their ag advisors. Thank you. I always like to remind people that California is the largest agriculture state in the country, just saying. Ms. Cameron, you noted in your testimony that dual pesticide registration process with the state and EPA can slow down the adoption of biologicals. From your perspective, how can federal and state agencies better coordinate to ensure that these tools are both safe and more readily available to growers? As you stated, there's a delay when we move from federal to state registration for products. I believe that parallel registration working with the maybe get an MOU between California part of pesticide regulation and the federal EPA office so that when products do come, and if they're going to have a fit in California, that we start the registration process at the same time so that we get registration concurrent. As you know, we increase the mill tax for pesticides last year with the idea that we are going to get products moving through the system at a more rapid pace. California farmers, especially crop growers, are innovative. They want new tools. They want new technology, and they're always willing to adopt. Thank you, Mr. Cameron. Finally, Mr. Cameron, as this committee continues to work on a farm bill, I'd like to revisit a point you're raising your testimony regarding integrated pests management, or IPM, which is already being used by many growers. One more can Congress do to help support methods like the use of integrated pest management, so growers can protect their crops, keep their operations strong, and increase crop resiliency. You know, I think pest management starts with your soil. We need to have healthy soils. We need to have funding for practices that will improve soil quality. Because I think you start out with a healthy plant and insect is less likely to cause the damage. I think there's programs through NRCS for funding into California that we could expand on. But getting new products out quicker at the federal level would be great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm out of time. Thank you, Mr. Cameron. Jeremy.",

        "transcript": " All right. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by thanking you for being here today, especially those that will be speaking with me from the podium. Today we have Linda Crop, Chief Counsel for the Environmental Defense Center. Michael Lyons, President of Get Oil Out. Katie Davis, Chair of the Santa Barbara Sierra Club. And Michael Cohen, President of the Santa Barbara Adventure Company. Thank you all for taking the time. This afternoon to voice your concern on behalf of our environment and your commitment to protecting our oceans. I undoubtedly represent one of the most beautiful and ecologically diverse districts in Congress. We are also lucky to live under central coast and to have this wonderful ocean as our backyard. With this incredible privilege, we must also remember that we have an even greater responsibility. To serve as stewards of these wonderful natural resources. And with that great responsibility in mind, I am pleased to announce that I am introducing my first piece of legislation in Congress this Monday called the California Clean Coast Act. This legislation would permanently ban future oil and gas leasing and drilling off the coast of California in the outer continental shelf. We've seen time and time again, the devastating environmental, economic threats posed by offshore oil drilling. Today marks the anniversary of the horrific 1969 oil spill off our Santa Barbara coast, in which over 100,000 barrels of crude oil were spilled into our waters, wreaking havoc on our ocean's ecosystem and tourism industry. In California, our coastal communities, local economies and fragile ocean ecosystem cannot afford another disastrous oil spill. This is why I am committed to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and the great risk oil drilling off our coasts presents to our environment. This legislation is one important step toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy future for our country and our central coast. We are entering a new and uncertain time in our nation's history. We now have a president that does not subscribe to fact-based information, including the irrefutable scientific data regarding the devastating impact of our country. This is the impact of climate change. With his executive orders encouraging the construction of two major oil pipelines in our country and his pick of Exxon's former CEO as Secretary of State, it is clear that our president's priorities do not align with our central coasts. This is why we are using our energy economy to shift our energy policy to combat the devastating effects of climate change. This is why it is critical, not more than ever, that we pass this legislation to protect our coastal environment from further oil drilling. This is why we are using our energy economy to protect our country and preserve its beauty and vibrancy for future generations. Today we are reminded that we must learn from our history as we remember the devastating impacts of our reliance on fossil fuels. We must act boldly beginning today if we are going to fight the impacts of climate change. We must use my friend and a tireless champion for our environment. Linda Crop with the Environmental Defense Center. Thank you. It's wonderful to see so many people out here on such a beautiful day. Just a big little louder. Thank you. We are living in a whole new reality show. I wish you was funny. There are no limits to the current threats from the Federal Administration to our environment, our communities and our economy, which all rely on healthy air and water and a clean ocean. We use the ocean for food, for recreation, for tourism, and for sustaining the precious resources that have led the Santa Barbara Channel in islands to be referred to as the glopigos of North America. But all of this is under immediate and imminent threat. Fortunately, we have a congressman who understands the value of our coast and ocean and is taking action to protect us from these new threats. These threats are very, very real. Not only do we stand on the site of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, which had devastating effects to our community and environment and fishing and tourism economies, but we just had a major oil spill only a year and a half ago. We know that it's not a question of if, but when we have an oil spill and that's why we need to take action now. This threat is greater than ever because we do have a president that can open our coast to more oil leasing and drilling. And that's why we stand here to support the California Clean Coast Act, which would permanently ban future oil and gas leasing off the California coast. Next, we have another champion of the environment, Katie Davis, group chair for the Santa Barbara Sierra Club. So a marine biologist friend of mine who has dived all over the world. She says one of her favorite places, one of the places with the most unique and special and amazing marine life, and the favorite place to dive is right here in the Santa Barbara channel. It's unique. And one of the best places to dive and snorkel offshore in the central coast was Rufuio Beach. I say, you know, it had these, it had these kelp forests and these rocky reefs. And I say had because it was devastated by the place pipeline oil spill. It was one of the best places in central California, maybe all of California, and it was devastated by an oil spill. It is our ocean and our coastline that makes Santa Barbara so special. The risk of another oil spill is unacceptable. We have had enough. The inevitable risk of spills is why we haven't allowed new offshore oil leases off California for so long, and this needs to be codified in federal law as it has long been for state waters. We thank Congressman Carbohol for his leadership. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By putting forward the California Clean Coast Act as his first act, to send the strongest possible message that new offshore oil leases are unacceptable, and we are willing to fight. Yes! Yay! Yay! Yay! And one last thing. We have more support on this than you think. I'm a member of Sierra Club's National Marine Action Team, a group of coastal activists from all around the country. When the Obama administration proposed drilling in the Atlantic Ocean, there was an outcry, and not just the liberal Northeast, but the Southeast as well, North Carolina. South Carolina. Georgia. Florida. These are red states. But 90% of coastal cities passed resolutions against offshore drilling and size protesting. It's bad for coastal business everywhere. After more, did 3.3 million, 3.3 million public comments, at 36 public meetings. The recent five-year lease plan excludes drilling in the Pacific Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Atlantic Ocean. It would be an incredible waste of public resources for the Trump administration to reopen that process, and a bad move politically. It would be the smarter move to pass this act. Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Ask any coastal city anywhere. Don't mess with our beaches. Thank you! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Next, we have Michael Ryan's president of Get Oil Out. We all know who Get Oil Out is, right? Yeah! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Two score, and eight years ago, to this day, America and the world was really awakened to the fact that our petroleum-based lifestyles are not enjoyed without consequence. This consequence being the swift degradation of our environment. And finally, after the 69th spill, Get Oil Out was formed by Santa Barbara citizens, affected by the oil disaster. And nationally, the oil spill sparked an environmental movement, along with New Federal. The oil spill sparked an environmental movement, along with New Federal and State legislation, aiming to prevent and reduce the threat of similar... ...disastrous environmental consequences from occurring again. Today, January 28, 2017, we, America and the world, continue to enjoy petroleum-based lifestyles, whether by choice or circumstance. We still, America still, and the world still, face the same consequences that oil spills wreaking havoc to our ocean and coastal environments. However, there exists an important and obvious difference today from 48 years ago. We now have 48 years of history. A 48-year historical pattern tells us that the threat of another oil spill resulting from petroleum production, along our coastline, is imminent, no matter what safeguards are thought to be in place. Oil spills in Santa Barbara, Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and once again in Santa Barbara, to name a few, demonstrate a historical pattern of consequences resulting from oil production. Even with the most expensive and proven modern-day technology and engineering know-how, the eminent threat still exists today. As such, Git Oil Out firmly supports Congressman Carbohol's California Clean Coastal Act that will get oil out by putting it into the historically imminent consequences of future oil development on the outer continental shelf of our priceless coastline. Thank you, Michael. Now we have Michael Cohen, owner of the Santa Barbara Adventure Company. Hello everyone. Such a wonderful crowd and all these smiling faces. I'm so glad to see you all here. My name is Michael Cohen. I started my journey of building a small business 18 years ago with a handful of kayaks and old rusted-out pickup truck and a passion for connecting this beautiful coastline with so many tourists and travelers that come here. Last year we hosted over 13,000 visitors on our tours. Tours that are dependent on a beautiful coastline and ocean, kayaking at Rufuio State Beach, the Santa Barbara Harbor, the Seekage kayaking, and our beautiful Channel Islands behind us. What a backdrop I have for this speech. We also provide out to our education programs to schools as well as many other groups that come to the area. How important is tourism and a clean environment to all of us, to our economy here? Well, I have some facts for you. And these are not all-turning facts, okay? Work with me on this one. 6.1 million visitors came to Santa Barbara in 2016 because of our pristine beaches and healthy lifestyle. Last year, tourism-related spending was, I'm not making this up, 1.54 billion dollars in related spending in Santa Barbara County. That's 1.54 billion dollars that got spent here because of this clean and beautiful environment. 850 million dollars were spent on hotels and lodging. 45.8 million dollars in revenue taxes were given to our city and county because of a clean environment. The need to protect this area that we are so lucky to share with others in this every day is of critical importance. As a business that's tied to this local tourism economy, I am 100% dependent on a clean and beautiful and thriving environment made possible through a green and clean economy. I started my business at Rufuio State Beach. I ran my first tour there. We felt firsthand the devastating effects in our own backyard and the effects to our business in that recent oil spill at Rufuio. It's impact was appalling environmentally and economically it hurt us. Let's not increase those odds by allowing more oil leases. I remain fearful of potential threats that further drilling will hold and reliance on fossil fuels. I have witnessed how the oil company that was responsible for the Rufuio oil spill dealt with businesses like myself. They delay, they deny, they pay pennies on the dollars all the while trying to say that they are here to make it right. That is just not true. Take a moment, take a moment and think of what our coast would look like after a spill the size of deep water horizon, the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico. That spill lasted 87 days. It dumped 200 million gallons of oil and it affected 16,000 miles of coastline, devastation to that area. There are, we do not need more oil in this area. There are more off-shore rigs than necessary here. We need to move to green energy such as solar, such as wind. There is a project in the Mohamie desert called the Desert Sunlight that produces energy for 160,000 homes. With that, I will close and say that I support Salud Carbohal's measure very strongly. Please help keep our area and support this act. And closing limits just say, what a great side you are for sore eyes. I am so energized by you all being here and more than ever we have to be vigilant and we have to be active. We know what's at stake and we have to speak up and I want to in particular recognize Indivisible Santa Barbara. We have to organize and we have to speak out. There is too much at stake. Thank you all for coming and I want to open it up to the media for questions. I was here 48 years ago. I was disgusted that lots of efforts were made to cover up this bill with fresh sand so our president didn't have to take a look at it. We did not have eight platforms out on the horizon at that time. We are at risk right now. We don't need to even look to the future that we must unless we are going to want our whole horizon line with those likely things. Thank you for your hard work. We just love you. We stand on shoulders of people that have come before us and I would be remiss if I didn't recognize two people. One congresswoman lowest cap. We are continuously and consistently fighting the good fight on this very important issue. The other person is my personal mentor Naomi Schwartz. We stand on their shoulders among many other people that have always been great advocates and champions for environmental protection. Any other questions? Yes. We are totally flogging for introducing this legislation in Congress. The combination of Rex Tillerson, CEO of ExxonMobil and Trump Secretary of State along with Rick Perry as a Secretary of Energy, creates a massive influence by oil and gas companies and economic and national security policies in our country. Can you say no to Trump's swamp cabinet please for us? I wish I had a say but the Senate is the one that makes those confirmations. I will say no every chance I get. Any other questions? The media? Nick Shaw, he doesn't want to ask his questions in front of you. I understand that we don't need more oil drilling but probably everybody here grows here in a car. Rotobike! We grow so close. I'm tuned into that. What I'm wondering is is there any future legislation that you can think of or who you will propose for alternate? Absolutely. I think we need to look at how the United States could invest more in creating incentives to propel more technology in the solar field, in the wave energy, in wind energy so that we could have those sources come to life sooner rather than later. We can also look at taking away the subsidies for oil companies. Yeah! We've talked about limited resources. We've got to look at where they're going and certainly the oil companies don't need additional resources. All right, I'm being told that's it. Thank you all for your time. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " And now he's refusing to attend this week's inauguration ceremony. Ruiz revealed his decision exclusively here on KMIR. That's right. In this controversy began when veteran congressman John Lewis declared he is not going because he doesn't consider Trump to be the legitimate president elect. Now, congressman Ruiz is joining Lewis in that growing protests. And Republicans here in the Coachella Valley as well as others are reacting. Our kitty Alvarado joining us now here in studio with both sides of this political firestorm. Kitty. Well, congressman role Ruiz is among a growing list of Democrats choosing not to attend presidential inaugural ceremonies on Friday. Ruiz says he doesn't think president elect Trump is respectful of the office. State Senator Jeff Stone and Valley residents weigh in on his decision. No, I am not attending the inauguration. Having an exclusive KMIR interview with Dan Ball, congressman role Ruiz made it clear he would not be attending president elect Donald Trump's official swearing and ceremony. It's a very difficult situation because I believe in the office, but this man is not respecting that office that I respect so much. By the way, he is behaving. He needs to be a real president. He needs to really bring unity. He needs to really respect the American people. And he's not alone. Over two dozen Democrats are planning to skip the inauguration. Many citing Trump's disrespect of civil rights leader congressman John Lewis on social media. Ruiz voiced his own concerns including conflicts of interest. A real president doesn't attack the press for asking tough questions. A real president doesn't go after celebrities or everyday Americans because they disagree with him. And a real president doesn't use the office of the presidency to make millions more for himself, for his own pocket and for his families. People in the valley are divided on his decision. I think that just creates further division in our government which is definitely the biggest problem we're facing. I respect that decision. I support him in that. Republican state senator Jeff Stone who challenged him in November says he plans to attend the inauguration. He thinks Ruiz is making a mistake and should reconsider. One thing we always pride ourselves in this country is that we have a peaceful transfer of power. And this is a historic event when we have a new president. He's ever represented for Democrats, Republicans, the independence, party and such. And he should be there to represent us to welcome the new president. And during the interview congressman Ruiz who is also a doctor spoke about the Affordable Care Act. He said both sides knew to come together to bring cost down on things like prescription drugs and have more transparency on medical pricing. Thank you. And once Donald Trump takes office on Friday, his predecessor could be coming here to the Coachella Valley TMZ reporting the first family will be leaving Washington, DC at about 2.45 on Friday morning heading here to the desert. As I say and the Obama's will be on board, one of the planes used as Air Force One, but it won't be flying under that name because Obama's to Obama will no longer be in office. It will be referred to as special air mission 29,000. And no word yet on where the first family will be staying or how long they'll be here.",

        "transcript": " Seven months ago, Jacqueline joined her father in fleeing the extreme danger and poverty of her village in Guatemala. They fled from violence. However, Jacqueline's life was cut short in December when she died of sepsis while under the responsibility of our federal government. As a physician, I know that the inhumane conditions at our border patrol facilities risked the lives of children when under CBP custody. That was California Democratic Representative Raul Ruiz on the House floor, speaking about Jacqueline Cal McKean. She's a migrant girl who died in U.S. custody back in December. She was seven. Jacqueline is one of six migrant children to die while in U.S. custody or shortly after being released. Five of those children were from Guatemala, the sixth from Honduras. All were in the custody of either customs and border protection or the Office of Refugee Resettlement. In response, Congressman Ruiz unveiled a bill designed to improve the medical treatment of all migrants in custody. Ruiz, who is a medical doctor, says the bill would help customs and border protection meet some of the minimum standards of care that all detainees require. Earlier, my colleague, Green and I, and spoke to Congressman Ruiz about the bill. Before entering Congress, you worked as a physician. In your background, what you've seen so far with the care of migrants in CBP custody, what stands out to you as the most problematic? The word to describe it is subhuman, deplorable, inhumane, and very heartbreaking to see the way that children, pregnant women, and the elderly are being treated and detained under the custody and responsibility of CBP. And what really stands out are children, children who don't have diapers, who are dirty, who are sick, being detained in very freezing, concrete, wind-wendless rooms. And that's something that any humanitarian, any parent would be outraged with. And I'm an emergency physician, EMS specialist, as well as Harvard-trained humanitarian and public health expert. And so I worked together with other experts to introduce this bill as a response to CBP's request and as a solution to the inhumane treatment and detention that these families are being our experiencing. What changes will your bill address? Well, it takes a very comprehensive public health approach to ensure the basic humanitarian standards are met to meet basic humanitarian needs of individuals to reflect the life with dignity. For example, it ensures that the medical screening has an interview in the language that they understand vital signs of physical examination and consultation with a provider who knows what a sick child looks like. It ensures that there's the basic minimum requirements of calories and water to make sure there's formula for infants, baby food, for children to ensure that there's enough space, a minimum amount of space, but enough space for individual to have a place for them to wash their hands, diapers for babies, enough latrines for men and women. So these are just, we're not asking for a lot of, or any special treatment. These are just basic necessities for a life with dignity. And you this does sound like basic necessities, but do you think that this bill can get support from both sides of the aisle? I do. I do believe this bill gets support. I've been in communication with CBP and their leadership throughout this entire process. They've requested the president's request of $3.3 billion in humanitarian aid. So this bill provides that roadmap, that blueprint of what exactly that money will be going towards based on basic humanitarian standards and norms in our country. How soon do you see this passing? I'm hoping that it will be included somehow or shape or form at least the requirements and these standards and the next humanitarian aid package that's going to help the Border Patrol agents down in the border. Okay. What you said about some news of the day, CBS News Count 61 of your Democratic colleagues now support an impeachment inquiry into the president. You've got House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who's maintained that Democrats have to focus on the investigation. Where do you stand, Congressman? You know, I think it's important to have an inquiry. I think it's important that we have answers to those questions. We need to bring everything out to the light of day. It's very wrong that we are dismissive of the Russian attack on our Democratic principles. It is very wrong on some of the behavior that Mueller has identified in his report and we need to get more answers. So I support getting that answer and holding bar and those folks who are trying to protect the president in contempt for not wanting to reveal what they know and to give us documents in order for us to protect the Constitution and our democracy. You know, some are saying that the Democratic caucus is divided over how to proceed with an impeachment inquiry or impeachment itself. Do you believe that the caucus is divided? You know, I think that we're not divided in getting the sense of we need more information. Whether or not an impeachment vote will lead to the removal of the president. I think that that is the question that we need to ask ourselves and whether or not that is the right path to go towards. And I think at that point there is some differences in opinion. You know, on another matter, the White House invoked executive privilege over materials related to the administration's push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Are you concerned about the effect that the citizenship question might have on the census? You know, yes, of course I'm concerned because the census was never supposed to be a political tool. The census is supposed to be an accounting of the population in order to provide the resources needed for the common good, the common good for all of society. And therefore when you start to under an administration that has already demonstrated their contempt for immigrants to start to provide a question that will cause a large portion of individuals to be fearful of being known, then I think that it's going to skew the numbers. And there's going to be a lot of more underserved communities across America, especially in rural areas. You are a congressman from California. We know the state has two 2020 presidential candidates, Senator Kamala Harris, as well as congressman Eric Swalwell. Is there a Democratic candidate you're endorsing at this time? You know, at this time I'm not both Kamala Harris and Eric Swalwell are very, very, very competent legislators. I'm excited about them both. I'm excited about some of the other presidential candidates, so I'm waiting to see how it progresses. All right, Congressman Raoul Ruiz, thank you for joining us. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " I'm Michael Steele. I don't get to say this too often, but I'm a newbie. I'm a new member of the bipartisan Sen. Board and I'm really excited to be here to work with my O'Friend Olympia. We had some fun back in the day. She called me out a couple of times as national chairman. So I know not to mess with the senator for sure, but it's a real pleasure to be here and to thank members of the board and certainly the senator for the opportunity to serve as a new board member. And I'm looking forward to serving with all of you and working with you on a lot of the important stuff issues, policies that not just the countries are home but individual states are confronting day in and day out. So I'm really excited about that. I'm really excited about this opportunity. I'm really excited about this opportunity. I'm really excited about this opportunity. It's to be in a space where being an American matters more than the label that you carry or that you wear. Or the tribe, since that seems to be the new operative term these days, the tribe that you're from. And the current base here at BPC is an important one. I know that my role as a national chairman was a very partisan role and a very partisan job. But I also acknowledged even as national chairman the tremendous diversity of views in this great country of ours. Views that even in the context of partisanship needed to be heard and recognized. I got in trouble a couple of times trying to do that, but that's okay. If you're afraid of getting into trouble, if you're afraid of upsetting the established status quo, then you need to get out of the game because the game really should be as much about that as anything else. Which I'm very, very excited to talk about right now because that's one of the reasons why we're here tonight. To talk about people who kind of push that envelope and recognize the importance and the vital importance of listening, learning, and acting, and doing the work that's required together whenever possible in order to achieve the results that our communities need now and into their futures. That is the spirit of the legislative action award and it is why, as I said, I'm particularly honored to be able to participate in tonight's celebration and to present one of our 2018 legislative action awards to a most worthy recipient representative Raul Ruiz. In just his third term, Congressman Ruiz is ranked 33rd in his entire party for legislative effectiveness by the Center for Effective Lawmaking. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Luger Center ranks him as more bipartisan than the great majority of the House. He ranks 161 out of 435 members. Representative Ruiz introduced bipartisan legislation that passed the House as part of a package of bills to address the horrendous and unacceptable backlogs for veterans and the claims that they have. He teamed up with Republican Representative Chris Gibson to introduce legislation to improve the delivery of veterans health care by merging the electronic health records of the VA and the Department of Defense. And he has recently introduced bipartisan bills to allow additional federal money to prevent deadly and destructive wildfires. Representative Ruiz is a member of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus, which is committed to forging bipartisan cooperation on key issues. He is also co-chairing a bipartisan Indian health service task force to examine our nation's tribal health system and to raise awareness about the challenges that system faces as well. Of no small significance, Congressman Ruiz has championed the repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is tasked with coming up with Medicare cuts in spending if the spending rises above a certain threshold. And has been criticized this particular board as outsourcing the work of Congress to quote an LA Times article from 2003 entitled Lessons from a Doctor Congressman's First Year. Quote Ruiz is most notable votes staking out the middle ground and defying the Democratic Party line on a pair of modifications to the Affordable Care Act weren't going to make him a hero on the right or the left. Well, I can tell you it's that kind of willingness to be his own person that certainly makes him a hero here at the BPC. He epitomizes the reasons we are here tonight. And so on behalf of the bipartisan policy center, I'm very honored to present to you, Dr. Congressman, with the 2018 Legislative Action Award. Congratulations, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. I didn't think anybody was paying attention. Thank you so much, Michael, for that kind introduction and that list of accomplishments. Thank you, Jason, for the award. Jason Grumman, the president of the bipartisan policy center and all the BPC's team and staff and supporters and everybody who makes working in a bipartisan fashion a priority because we definitely need that now more than ever. I am so honored to be one of only four in the House and Senate to receive the bipartisan policy center's Legislative Action Award this year, given to representatives and senators who work to build bipartisan consensus, practice, civility and advance legislation on pressing issues. My life mission is to serve others and I do it first and foremost as a physician. And my worldview and approach is as a physician. So let me tell you a little bit about how I decided that I was going to serve the public as a physician. So when I was four years old, I grew up in a trailer park, both my parents were farm workers and my older brother was a first to graduate from high school. It was a high school counselor that paid for my college application. But when I was very young, about four or five years old, my mother asked me, son, what do you want to be when you grow up? I said, well, I want to be that in Spanish. And my mother, if you know her, you'll realize that she's an angel. She'll give the shirt off her back to anybody who needs one, even though she, that would, that may be her only shirt that she owns. She's always so very giving. So when she asked me that, I admired her and I said, well, mother, what do you call others that's that people who serve others like you? She was very smart. She said a doctor. So I became, so I graduated high school, went to UCLA, went to Harvard Medical School, the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Board Certified and Emergency Medicine went to the Harvard School of Public Health, finished, went back home and started serving the community as a physician opening free clinics, starting pre-med mentorship programs, leading healthcare initiatives and, and, and so forth. And as an emergency physician, my priority is always my patients and doing what is right for my patients. So when someone comes into the emergency department, we work as a team to care for people, to give them treatment, to save lives, to ensure that their lives are better. We don't ask our patients whether they are Democrats or Republicans and we don't fight against each other to see who gets the credit or cast or to see who gets the blame. So we take care of business by focusing on the patient and Congress should be no different. Everything we do should be about people, putting people first and improving their lives. It is that emergency physician problem solving approach I bring to Congress, putting people over politics and solutions above ideology. And I make it a priority to work with anyone who has a good idea, Republican or Democrat, to find pragmatic solutions to the challenges facing my constituents and our nation. So just recently I worked together with Representative Dr. Phil Roe to co lead the Protecting Seniors Access to Medicare Act, which eliminated the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a well intention, but misguided attempt to control rising medical costs. It threatened to put an unelected and unaccountable panel in charge of making cuts to Medicare. Dr. Roe and I gathered 270 co-sponsors, worked it through the process, and it was signed into law as part of a larger legislative package. And this is how we working together on the bipartisan solutions can start making government work for the people. Over the years I am proud to have sponsored five and been the Democrat lead for another five Republican bills that have become law. My bill is aimed at getting veterans the benefits they have earned and deserve more quickly and efficiently, reducing the appeals backlog, recruiting the best doctors to provide the best care for veterans, and most recently a bill which protects communities in the wake of a severe wildfire, like the ones we recently had in California. The fact is it doesn't matter whose name is on the bill or what party it comes from. If it's a good idea we have a responsibility to come together and support it. And during this period of hyperpartisan rhetoric we need bipartisan workhorses that stand ready to roll up their sleeves, find common ground, and get things done for the American people. So going against the partisan grain, as Michael mentioned, isn't the easiest thing to do and won't make you the most popular person here in DC. But when you believe it is the right thing to do for your constituents you need to have the courage to do it. It's about cutting through the dysfunction to produce solutions and outcomes for the people that we serve. In Dr. Language it's about taking care of the patient, starting with them at the center and devoting your life for their betterment. And that's how it is for me now as a congressman. So I am truly humbled that this pragmatic problem solving approach has been recognized by the bipartisan policy center, and I look forward to continuing to serve my patients and my constituents through thoughtful bipartisan solutions. Thank you very much. You",

        "transcript": " So all of you know that today is a remarkable and special occasion to honor John Mealy and his career and what he has done for the people of the Coachella Valley for so many years. And there's no way I was going to miss this regardless of my schedule. So please pardon the intrusion early and I do have to leave after I speak. But know that that that is not a reflection of the amount of respect and adoration and admiration I have for John Mealy. I'm known John Mealy from before I ran for Congress because of his work that he did for underserved populations in our valley and me as a physician. And I got to know John Mealy really good as a congressman because nobody advocated more fiercely with more dedication and with more passion and compassion than John Mealy for the people that he serves. And that is something that I respect and admire and because of that his story and his contributions to our community will forever be catalogued and recorded in the congressional record in the history of our nation. And it will read for generations to come. It will read Mr. Speaker today I am honored to congratulate John Mealy on his retirement after 34 years of leadership in helping build communities and changing lives for thousands of farm workers, service workers and chronically ill residents through the Coachella Valley housing. In 1982 Mr. Mealy led the way with community leaders to address the housing needs of hundreds of low income families in the Coachella Valley by forming CVHC. That same year CVHC received its first grant of $10,000 from Etna Foundation and in 1986 they built the first low income farm workers complex in Coachella, my hometown, California. Fast forwarding three decades and thanks to Mr. Mealy's diligent work and vision he has helped fund raise over $700 million towards building more than 4,500 homes and apartments for low and very low income residents in the Coachella Valley. Furthermore, under Mr. Mealy's guidance CVHC has created home ownership opportunities from Palm Springs to Blythe in the 36 congressional district. This translates into a dream come true for families and a better and brighter future for generations to come. In 2002 the Board of Directors and Employees of CVHC established the JFM College Scholarship Fund program in honor of Mr. John Mealy. The Scholarship Fund award scholarships annually to students who reside in affordable housing communities developed by CVHC. The JFM has generated half a million dollars in scholarship funds and benefited more than 600 students. Mr. Mealy's extraordinary career began in Philadelphia at a nonprofit housing organization. Before joining CVHC in 1982 he worked at the Riverside Department of Housing and Community Development. Mr. Mealy also served as a board member on the California Coalition for Rural Housing, the Natural Rural Housing Coalition and the Natural Equity Fund. Amongst the numerous reputable recognitions that Mr. Mealy has obtained throughout his remarkable career he recently was honored with the Rural Community Assistance Corporation award. This distinction is presented to those individuals who demonstrate the lifetime achievement of leadership and rural development, building and sustaining an organization that benefits rural communities and has a regional impact. So Mr. Speaker I am proud to recognize Mr. Mealy who for nearly four decades dedicated his time to better the lives of underserved communities. For his work and on behalf of the thousands of families of the 36 Congressional District of California I would like to offer my sincerest thanks and congratulate Mr. Mealy for his exceptional commitment. I wish him and his wife Patricia the best on his well-deserved retirement. So this will forever be in the Congressional record. I have a... I can't say anything. This is a big shock. I really appreciate all the great things you do. You're the great great workers. You open doors for all of us. A lot of us farm workers. Families. Yeah? Oh man. The last time I was in your office in DC you pointed out that we hadn't sent you a picture from the scholarship. Here is one here. That's great. A picture with you in the middle and you can put that up in here. Alright so let's hold our respective... let's hold our respective plagues here.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Today, we come together to address one of our nation's most pressing crisis opioid addiction and abuse. I would like to thank House and State Senate leadership for their work on this conference report. In particular, I would like to thank ranking member Pallone for his tireless leadership on this issue and for being an important guiding voice on the Energy and Commerce Committee. As my colleagues before me have noted millions of Americans each year face the devastating impact of drug abuse and addiction. As an emergency medicine physician, I have seen far too many patients who have fallen victim to this horrible cycle of addiction. I remember when a young man, blue with purple lips, was dropped out of a moving car not breathing. He was rushed into my emergency room and I intubated him to protect his airway, gave him Nalaxone and other supportive care, saved his life. But I always wondered if he had the appropriate resources once he left the emergency department to turn his life around to get treatment and to live that better life that we all strive for. I have seen this crushing physical and emotional impact on medication abuse on individuals and their families. Today we have an incredible opportunity to enact meaningful legislation to combat the epidemic of opioid abuse and help save millions of lives. In 2014, more than 28,000 Americans died because of an opioid abuse. They suffered, their families in loved ones suffered, their community suffered. Today, more Americans die from drug overdoses than car crashes. In fact, opioid abuse and addiction have become the leading cause of injury and death in the United States. Our constituents are calling on us to act. Now is the time to ensure we provide meaningful resources and support so that millions suffering from this disorder can move forward on the path towards recovery. This plans and ideas are important, but they must include the resources that will allow local, state and federal officials to implement these ideas and fully address what is truly a public health crisis. That is why I join my colleagues in demanding that our actions reflect the seriousness of this health crisis by including the necessary funding as part of the conference report we will produce today. We need funding so that law enforcement and other first responders are able to reverse the effects of an overdose and save more lives. We need funding so that patients, their families and the public are educated on the signs, symptoms and treatment of opioid abuse and more importantly, how to prevent opioid abuse. We need funding so that programs we implement in support of states around the country are sustainable and make lasting measurable improvements. We cannot let our words become merely emptying promises and in conclusion, it is critical that we ensure Americans who are suffering receive the resources, treatment and support. They need to overcome addiction so that opioid abuse patients and their families who leave the emergency department have a meaningful chance to heal and to turn their lives around. I yield back my time.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Senator. Mr. Morsele, as we all watch Ukrainian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians respond to Russia who are demonstrating really great acts of heroism. I am reminded of all the heroes that you represent and who have fought bravely for our freedoms. And today I just want to say thank you. The first question I have is in your oral testimony, Mr. Morsele, you stress the importance of the caregiver program, which I couldn't agree with you more. I recently introduced the Elizabeth Doll home and community-based services for Veterans and Caregivers Act of 2022 to provide all veterans the ability to be at home for their care when they needed. And to stay away from institutionalized nursing home care over half of the veteran population today who used the VA are over 65 years of age. So I was wondering how you felt about this bill that I just introduced. Thank you for that question. And I will yield to our legislative director, Ms. Ela. Thank you, Combswomen. Excellent bill, DAV is very appreciative and supports the bill lots of provisions in there that are going to make a real difference in veterans lives. We need to make sure that veterans do have those home-based primary care services to continue to be able to live in their homes as they age to the extent possible. And we need to make sure that our aging veteran population, which is really going to increase over the next 20 years that VA's prepared both with the internal VA services that will be needed, the inpatient community living centers, our veteran state homes, as well as that home-based directed care. So we really appreciate the hard work from you and your staff on that issue and a very thoughtful bill and happy to have supported it. Thank you, Ms. Ela. And thank you for your leadership. I'll stick with questions to you since I have very long time. I know, Mr. Marshall talked a lot about and stressed a lot around women veterans sexual harassment, MST, and the need for all of that. Can you talk a little bit about where we still need to go with regards to women veterans? I know I only have about 20 seconds left, but if you could just highlight a few. I'll make this quick then. Certainly, we appreciate all of those efforts that you've made in this regard made a huge difference as has both of these committees. And I think moving forward, we're seeing progress with regard to the zero tolerance policy that the Secretary has put forth and letters that have starting to go out to every veteran I've received when myself for those that use the VA health care system. That's a great first step. We're going to need Congress to continue to do oversight. This isn't been a long-standing issue. So we will be though behind you to make it happen. Thank you, Mr. Ela. I'm going to give back Senator. Thank you. Senator Blumenthal.",

        "transcript": " Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen my name is Rod Codman I'm with the Ventura County Public Defenders Office. Before we get started with the background on our keynote speaker I'd like to thank Pepperdine School of Law. What a great lunch right thank you very much. It's great lunch. Like to thank Pepperdine for putting on the event. I'd also like to thank Pepperdine for sending me all these great law clerks of works in our Veterans Treatment Court. Thank you. Let's speak a little bit about our keynote speaker. Congresswoman Brownlee was elected in November of 2012. She represents Ventura County in Congress. Congresswoman serves on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs where she's working to make sure that our nation provides the benefits and care our veterans and their families deserve. She does add an honor of their service to our country. Congresswoman Brownlee was elected as the ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health. She also serves on the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs as the ranking member of the House Subcommittee. Congresswoman Brownlee focuses on improving veterans access to mental and physical health care. Improving services for female veterans and I'm going to pause here for a moment. Some of you may be aware of some of the recent legislation that the Congresswoman passed for some of our female veterans. She also works to help service members transition from military to the VA health care system. Congresswoman Brownlee also sits on the House Committee on Transportation Infrastructure where she serves on the Subcommittee on Aviation, Subcommittee on Coast Guard, Maritime Transportation and the Subcommittee on Highways and Transits. One of Congresswoman Brownlee's highest priorities is to expand the care offered to Ventura County veterans in Ventura County and across the nation, not just to Ventura County. This includes expanding the size of the Seabock so that more providers can be hired and more specialty care can be offered. Since she took office in 2012, the Seabock has increased almost threefold in size. In February, at her urging, the House Veterans Affairs Committee passed a bill that would authorize a standalone VA run 40,000 square foot community clinic in Ventura County. It is the first facility for veterans to offer specialty care like auditory, cardiology and dermatology in Ventura County. Since coming to Congress, her office has returned more than $9.6 million in retroactive and estimated monthly benefits for veterans and their families. And we heard this morning from our panel how important that is. She encourages veterans with claims at the VA and again with our first panel this morning, we heard how important it was for those upgrades and those claims. She encourages veterans to contract her district offices for that assistance. Now, Congresswoman Brownlee primarily represents Ventura County as her congressional district. But I will tell you that Congresswoman Brownlee believes that all our vets, all of you here that have served, wherever you live, be it Ventura, Los Angeles, Mississippi, Tennessee, Bangor, Maine, she represents those vets also because they all serve and they're all our vets. So with that, please give a warm welcome to our keynote speaker, Congresswoman Julia Brownlee. Thank you. Well, good afternoon and that's really a delight to be here with you all. And I thank Pepperdine University for hosting this very important conference. And thank you, Rod, for a very kind introduction. Thank you, Jeff and your team, all of you for putting this together. I really am very, very honored to be here. And I think we're probably in one of the most beautiful settings in the country, quite frankly. But Ventura County is a pretty special place. And when I'm back in Washington, D.C., I always say I live in one of the most beautiful areas in all of California. But it is a beautiful district also for other reasons. And in one is, it is a county that is home of Naval Base Ventura County. We have a lot of military men and women who live in our district. And we are also the home of 50,000 veterans in Ventura County. And I was raised in a military family. My father was a proud Marine, my brother flew P3s for the Navy. My two uncles served in the Army and the Coast Guard. And many of their friends served in the military. So I thought I knew something about the experience of those who have served our country and their families. And when I was elected in 2012, I immediately put my hat in to be on the committee that serves our veterans in Washington. And I knew I could not only honor the many, many veterans in my district, but I could honor all of the veterans throughout our country and really represent my own family and their service to our country. And I was very pleased to not only be selected to serve on the committee, but then to be elected, as was mentioned, as the ranking member on the subcommittee for health. The subcommittee has jurisdiction over all health care programs, both physical and mental, provided by the VA. And as many of you know, the VA health care system is the largest integrated health care system in the country. Of the nation's 21 million veterans, almost 9 million are enrolled in VA health care. The VA's budget is over $175 billion a year, and it employs over 340,000 people. Many of them are veterans themselves. As I said before, I thought growing up around so many veterans that I knew quite a bit about their challenges. But it wasn't until I joined the VA Committee in Congress that I truly began to understand the enormous challenge our country faces, keeping good on its promise to provide veterans with a care, the benefits, and the support that they need to transition to the VA. And I think that the VA's transition successfully back into civilian life. Of course, after multiple tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, and with important advancements and innovations in medicine, more veterans are coming home, who have not impassed wars, and that's really the good news, and it's a blessing. This has also been a challenge for the veterans and for the VA's health care system. The other more emerging health challenge is not surprisingly mental health. As I think back upon my own upbringing, I cannot for one single moment remember any of my family members or their friends talk about the emotional impact of their service. The culture, thankfully, is changing, and today the VA has compensated almost 1 million veterans for post-traumatic stress. But estimates are that one in five veterans returning from Afghanistan in Iraq suffer from post-traumatic stress. The National Institute of Health estimates that 31% of the non-vetrants suffer as well from PTSD. During War War II they called it shell shock or combat exhaustion, but the numbers were roughly the same. I recently read a New Yorker article on the culture and impacts of trauma, and the author quoted a friend who said, I can't see how anyone could go to Iraq and not come back with post-traumatic stress. It's a good question, and I suspect it's much closer to the truth. We also know that among those who met the criteria for post-traumatic stress or depression at the VA, only a third actually seek help or treatment. No matter how many veterans are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress, and no matter how many received treatment, we know that one in ten returning veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom and enduring Freedom have problems with substance abuse. And whatever number you use, the rate of suicide among veterans is far higher than it is among civilians. Some say it's 20% higher, some say it's 50% higher, and the rate of female veterans suicide, an issue as was mentioned, and I've been working very closely on, is even higher than that. Among the homeless population, the numbers are fuzzy, but estimates put homeless veterans at close to 40,000 making up around 7% of the total homeless population nationwide. Another shocking statistic, a recent survey by the VA shows that two in five service women said they had experienced either sexual assault or some kind of sexual harassment in the military. A study done in 2011 suggested that women veterans were three to four times more likely to be homeless compared to non-veteran women. I know you'll be discussing many of these issues today and tomorrow, but the statistics are quite stark. One statistic that is a little more optimistic, however, is the declining rate of incarceration among our veterans. In 1978, 24% of prisoners were veterans. Today, veterans make up just 8% of the national prison population. And I believe that decline is due in part to the substantial increase in the number of veteran treatment courts in recent years. As you may know, the first court was founded in 2008, and that quite frankly wasn't very long ago, by Judge Robert Russell in Buffalo, New York. Today, there are more than 300 across our country, including in my district in Ventura County. I first visited Ventura County Veterans Treatment Court in 2014. The court was formed in 2010 through the leadership and efforts of Judge Colleen Toy White, and with a buy-in of many local veterans advocates, the VA, the District Attorney's Office, and the Ventura County Public Defenders Office. What I remember most from that first visit was just the genuine care and commitment of the staff and the attention, really, that they gave to each veteran. It was very much a team approach where everyone came together to map out a unique recovery plan for each veteran in the program. They would walk through the veteran's circumstances to prescribe a plan, whether it was group therapy, counseling, or medication. The court used a variety of approaches, each tailored to the veteran's specific situation. They would also problem solve to break down barriers, big or small for the veteran, like making sure the veteran had transportation to an appointment or actually making the appointment for the services the veteran needed. The court, quite frankly, became a savior for these veterans, a community of people who finally cared and understood them, and it provided the structure they needed to rebuild their lives. The Ventura County Treatment Court initially served 25 veterans, but today it's serving over 100, and that's pretty amazing. But we still, of course, it's still not fulfilling all of the needs within the county. The stories of the veterans who wind up in these courts are probably familiar to many of you. Petty Officer Mark Martinez is one. He faced DUI charges because he resorted to bench drinking, to cope with the terrible experiences he saw during combat, during his eight years of service with the US Navy. Where there's Jennifer Wormer, she left her children and their father to serve and protect us. When she returned, she used drugs to cope with her stress and separation and anxiety. It led her down a dark path as she was struggling to keep, just simply keep her family off the street. And then there's Chief Petty Officer, Rashad Boyd. He was a combat medic who saw the trauma of war every single day fighting to help his fellow brothers and sisters survive on the battlefield. He had nightmares and used alcohol and drugs to deal with his depression that caused him to alienate his wife and almost take his own life. Mark, Jennifer, and Rashad, they are the faces of the many veterans who are struggling to make sense of life after war. And while they share a commonality in having arrived at the Veterans Treatment Court, their life experience before, during, and after their service is as unique and individual as each one of them are. The Veterans come to the court looking for a second chance and oftentimes it may be their last chance. It's not uncommon that veterans come in with deep-seated mental health challenges that have plagued them for years without having received the care they need to address these challenges. These underlying issues lead to a cycle of destructive behavior that ultimately brings our veterans for the courts. The courts work for a number of reasons. But in my experience with the Ventura County Treatment Court, three main drivers, the three main drivers for success are as follows. First, the veteran is committed to turning things around. Anyone who went through the program will tell you that they are grateful for the Treatment Court program, but no one will tell you that it was easy. Second, the staff at the court are so very committed to the cause. In fact, many do this work on top of their day jobs. They volunteer their time on lunch breaks and evenings, weekends, and sandwiched between busy work schedules and responsibilities of life. Finally, our court works because we have an extended community of organizations and individuals to provide the support system necessary not only to make it through the program, but to be there for the veteran long after the program is completed. Ventura County has over 120 organizations dedicated to helping veterans succeed in civilian life. We call it our military collaborative that brings these organizations together under one roof to coordinate their efforts and to initiate active dialogue with the VA. We also have tremendous buy-in from our district attorney, our county sheriff, our public defender, and our legislators. I'm pleased to say that over 300 veteran treatment courts around the country are currently working with over 13,000 veterans. That's a 40% increase since 2008. That's great, and we must recognize that progress, but it is still not enough. Funding for the courts is currently inadequate, and it comes from many sources, including local, state, and federal funding. While I've worked to increase federal funding for veteran treatment courts and many of my colleagues in Congress as well, by more than 20% each year, it's still just a poultry $6 million for the entire nation. We absolutely need to do more. We spend billions and billions of dollars preparing our men and women for the battlefield, but we hardly think about the cost of their successful transition back into civilian life, and I believe that paradigm really needs to change substantially. And while we know that 60% to 80% of justice involved veterans had a substance use disorder prior to their incarceration, we know that 25% to 40% were suffering from a mental health disorder, and 23% were homeless at some point in the year preceding court. We still don't have enough data on the outcomes across the country of our courts. If these courts, I believe, are to succeed and to grow, we are going to need more of that data. We also need to share best practices to create more opportunities for partnerships and to create more comprehensive programs and interconnected networks of resources and services like we have in the county under the military collaborative. That's why I believe this conference is so critically important. By forming a community of professionals, we take the most important first step in creating a stronger, more collaborative approach. To justice for our veterans, whether it is the judge or legal staff that manage the case, the service providers and VA professionals who offer treatment, or the veteran peers and mentors who stand side by side with the veteran through the whole journey. We need a fully integrated and multifaceted approach to truly address the problems affecting some of our veterans caught in the justice system. We can accomplish both of these goals with more involvement by dedicated professionals like yourselves and more conferences like this one, and we must continue to spread the word to our communities, to our justice system, and to our elected officials. In fact, whenever someone asks me how I could possibly bear the dysfunction of Congress, and I'm letting you know right now, there is a little bit of that back in Washington. I will always tell them about the stories of the lives we are able to impact through case work, especially veteran case work, and through programs like the Veterans Court. Those stories include that of petty officer Mark Martinez, who received the help he needed through a veterans treatment court to overcome his drinking problem and post traumatic stress. He is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in political science right here at Heperdine University, and Jennifer Wormuth, who was able to rebuild her life, and now works as a peer support specialist at the VA. And Chief Petty Officer Rashad Boyd, who has been able to address his mental health issues and substance abuse and plans to become a drug and alcohol counselor for other veterans. So on behalf of Mark, Jennifer, and Rashad, and the over 13,000 veterans currently participating in veteran treatment courts around the country, thank you for being here today and for the work that you do. Building communities of collaboration is essential to making sure that our veterans receive every opportunity to succeed. And so I want to again thank Pepperdine for hosting this important conference. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Rod, for putting this together, and for all of you being here. If there's anything I can do that comes out of your discussions over the next two days. Please call our office and talk to me because there might be important ideas and potential legislation that could come out of this caucus. I just thank you all very, very much, and our military men and women who have served our country so very, very bravely and to all of the veterans who are here. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your service, but I know they deserve better and we can do better. So thank you very much.",

        "transcript": " was also in 2012 that the House of Representatives was considering the reauthorization of the violence against women act, but the majority of House Republicans hesitated. They hesitated to support improvements to make sure all women, minority women, gay women, and students on college campuses would also be protected under the law. My opponent is well. My opponent in his race, he hesitated as well. In fact, he said that he refused to stand up for these added protections because he didn't want to take sides in the matter. Well, we all know what happened in 2012 that people with Missouri knew better and rejected Tariaken. In fact, across the country, candidates who did not stand up for women on domestic violence, choice, equal pay for equal work were soundly defeated. If you don't stand up for women, we won't stand up for you. One of our nation's greatest leaders stood up for the survivors of domestic violence, stood up for raising the minimum wage, stood up for equal pay for equal work, and stood up for choice. In fact, he signed the original violence against women act in 1994. In 2012, and support of expanding protections for all women, he is one of our nation's greatest leaders because he stood up for time and time again for those who need it standing up for. I am so proud that he has traveled to Ventura County to help elect leaders who will stand up for survivors no matter what. Leaders who will stand up for equal pay for equal work, and leaders who will stand up for women's right to choose. Ladies and gentlemen, and all the great people of Ventura County, the most lovely greatest honor of a lifetime, to give to you the 42nd president of Ventura County. I actually have a daughter who is the only person I know that has got as many degrees as Dr. Ruiz. So I'm happy what I am concerned about my country because we have one big problem, even though our citizens are more empowered than ever before. We have been laboring under this illusion a lot of us, particularly those of us who make more modest income and have to get kids to childcare early in the morning and go off to work, that it's enough for us to vote in presidential elections and we don't have to vote in the off-year election. Well then the off-year election is 100 percent of the House of Representatives is elected. One third of the Senate is elected. Most governors are elected. Most state legislators are elected. And if you think it doesn't make it different, you're wrong. I just talked to one of my greatest old political friends, a man I start with, who was governor of North Carolina for 16 years, a great progressive Democrat named Gemhot. And we're talking about it over there. Here are the consequences of not voting in off-year elections. In the 2012 election, the Democrat's money for the House of Representatives in North Carolina got more votes in the Republicans. In the delegation, there are 10 Republicans and three delegates. How is that possible? It goes too many people to invoke when all those legislators were elected. You've got to read all the lines. So the first thing I want to tell you is all of you who are here, it's a good sign. These people will all be elected if you vote. Yeah. And the real choice is not most of what's in the air. The real choice is shaped by one central reality. In 2008, we had a financial crash. It was horrible. It was really horrible for California. You paid a terrible price to the education cuts in Oslo. And you'd like to Jerry Brown, and I think he took the little brother home. Okay, now. In 150 years, there have been four financial crashes in America and many in other rich countries throughout the world. We had them in 1872, 1892, the Depression in 32, and then one in 2008. There was one in Japan in 1990. There wasn't over what I left office. They take on average 10 years to get over. That is on average it takes 10 years to get back to jobs you lost when the financial section cracked. And if not harder to figure it, thank you for all the people who lost their homes in California. So, banks are scared to land. People are scared to borrow. Families are scared to spend. Everybody's scared to take a chance. When a business starts doing better, they just try to get everybody who works for them, work hard, and so the harms of the extra. Everybody goes around on inkships. It takes a long time. Last month, in six years, America got back all the jobs we lost. I don't expect anybody to be happy because ordinary people don't feel it yet. And because ever since I left office, almost all the gains have gone to people at the top. But when I was there, listen to this. Compared to the only time trickled down economics over work, which was when President Reagan tried it because we never had trickled that economics before where you gave all the tax cuts to upper income people and ran and trickled at that and did all that stuff. So, it's like we were on an eight-year sugar high. He was devastating, and the president was you following him, and that's why I was elected. And let's just take the best they ever did to trickled down economics. The top 20 percent of us, when I was president, and he was president, both had their incomes increased by more than 20 percent. Actually, they did a hair better under Reagan, but only because the top two percent of them. The next 20 percent, 25 percent better under Bill the middle class, and give four people the chance to work their way into it, middle out economics. The middle 20 percent of us, they're 50 percent better when I was president. The next day, the 80th percent out, the 4th, 20 percent, did more than twice as well. And listen to this, the bottom 20 percent under Reagan, their incomes went up seven cents of one percent. When I was there, 23.6 percent. Yeah, why did they inform us about it? Because we're back, we're like Freddie Kluber, it all is new to us. And his election is really about deciding how we're going to go forward. And what's really paying for all those black-back ads is a passionate desire on the other side to go right back to the trickled down economics that got this country in trouble in the first place. I don't know, anybody else said that. We don't want to raise the minimum wage, we believe in equal pipe for equal work. We believe in reform into college, law and program, lower the interest rate to make it possible for people by all that wants to act as a legitimate dinner income, so we know what else we call that. We believe in investing in the future and times and technology. That's what we believe in. We believe in training people who won't get for your college degrees for jobs that will be available. So as soon as they get through with the program, they can go right to work. We believe in helping veterans who serve this country. To be served by the Fourth Day Day in the military, so they can work in the private sector. We believe in helping women veterans who overcome the slits of our activities, they can. We believe that we're all in this together. And that's what the selection is about. So if we vote, as if there were a presidential election, there won't we? And we don't. We're in trouble. And your being here shows that. But don't make any mistakes. I don't care what the answer is, that's what the election is about. We're back to ground zero. We've got our jobs back. We're giving a chance to now make the future. And the question is, if we're going to do it together, or not, I work all over the world. And I can tell you, that whether it's working with Congressman Dr. Ruiz and the Consulate Valley, which we, and my foundation as a project that he's been leading heavily involved in, to improve the health outcomes of the people there, are working with women farmers who form an acre, a land in Malawi with a handheld hope, where we've increased their incomes and average of five hundred and seventy percent per year. Wherever people work together across the lines that we look at throughout the five year good things happen. Whenever people spend all their time fighting, good things don't happen. This is not rocket science. These are jobs. I'm really proud of Mayor Aguilar. I mean, he was hardly old enough to vote, hardly old enough to shave the first time he was elected. I'm the same guy. I was reading his biography. I realized he moved to Revolence when I was president. I made me feel ancient. But he worked across the line to get balance with budget and he invested in the community and he generated a job by working together. The thing that impressed me when I started working with Congress, with Reeds, he was not a congressman. He was a doctor. And as you just heard, the son of farm workers, who was living in a county that had the richest and poorest Americans, living in a place where everybody respected his hard-earned skills. And I noted how he moved easily among the people he went home to help. When he could have taken those three hard-earned degrees and gone to New York and made a fortune. And he came home to help. And I noted that he was comfortable with the people he came from. And now it's changed. And he didn't want to escape. He wanted to embrace. But he was also comfortable with people who could help him achieve those dreams. And so we did something that we've done before. We got all these people in that county across party lines and income lines, everybody working together to improve health outcomes because if you can keep people healthy or longer, your health care costs will go away now. I think we're two years ago to campaign for him and to campaign for Julian. And I was impressed that when she got to the Congress, she wanted to work on veterans assignments. She wanted to help women veterans. And she served a position in the Congressman committee that invests in science and technology because technology related jobs are going to create the opportunities of California's future. So I will say again, I don't care what you're under against. This is a job. And since I can't run for anything anymore, I can tell you something. I still like to have an experience. If you live, you reach a certain point in your life. And you realize that even if you live to be 100, you still got more yesterdays than tomorrow's. And believe it or not, you're tomorrow's minimal. I think less about the past today than I did when I was in my 20s. When I was 20, my 20s, I wanted to be one of those great southern novelists. So I was obsessed with every little detail of my life. Now I think about the only thing that matters in public service. It's the only three things that matter. And this is when they keep scoring. Or people better off when you point them when you start. To our children and grandchildren who have a brighter future. And our things coming together instead of being torn apart. If you can give the right answers to that, the rest of this is all the background music. This is about you. This is not a close question. Nobody really thought she could win. And now the Republicans are spending all this money to beat her by confusing you. I got to admit, they have been trying to blame the president for the Ebola outbreak. We were reading some of these, lifting some of these news programs you would think that every third person had given the facts. One man in Canada, the United States, gravely ill already, has passed the weapon. Two nurses who got it because they were courageous enough to treat people have been cured and are Ebola-free. One more doctor is still in his period of treatment and in all probability will survive. That's it. Now I take all this posturing and blaming personally because my foundation works in Liberia. And we had to take our eight workers out of the people work on AIDS out of the field. But our top four people were asked by the president of Liberia to stay by that and work because they had no health care system. You want to make sure that Ebola comes to America, fix the health care systems and Liberia to get them. And that's it. In Nigeria, they have one Ebola case and the country is going to clear the Ebola for you. You know what? They said 500 doctors to 19,000 homes and 36 hours. They isolated everybody that had ever had any kind of contact. They held the port down and they fixed it. This is a fixable problem. But if you're interested in it, you got to get everybody working together and you got to just tune out all that blame place and I may be interested in first my ears. And I got four people there who've recently arrived ever since they've broken out and thank God not have been infected yet. But it's a metaphor for what the selection is about. Once I've watched you be all torn up and upset and stopped thinking, we want you to think about the fact that we got our jobs back now we can create the future. And we ought to do it together with Ebola for General Israel. Equal participation. I'm telling you, I don't feel like anybody goes on the air, that's what this election is about. That's what the violence against one night is about. And it happened that I was super sensitive to it because I grew up in a home that had the domestic violence. But you shouldn't have to personally experience poverty and want poor people to have a chance to become doctorate. You shouldn't have to personally be elected. May our city and the inland empire to believe that Republicans and Democrats could work together to balance a budget and grow the economy. We shouldn't have to be the first immigrant elected in 70 years in the Turra County to know that there is no partisan difference when it comes to empowering veterans when they come home and make the most of them all right. I'm just telling you again. I'm grateful I got to go to my fence and reunite. I'm grateful to be grandfather. I am grateful that my wife and I have had a chance, hearing I've had an unbelievable chance to live lives that could never have been predicted given our child's. And I just want you to do it. And I'm just telling you, working together works constantly conflicts of dead vanguism. Thinking about what you can do to liberate the potential of every human being and helping everybody do well works and triple down economics to the dead vanguism. And the only way you lose is if you stay home. Now they gave me some notes on how this works. So I'm going to read down. I'm sorry, I love you Bill. You're a man of wealth. If you do the low bottom male, they got to be male by tomorrow because they got to be in my election day. Otherwise you can walk your ballad in and drop it off after falling place or you're going to use boat on election day. You need to decide how you're going to do this. And then you need to convince other people what they all do. The one problem with these rallies no matter how great they are is that in the parlance of my native culture I'm preaching the same to you. But every one of you know somewhere between 2500 and 100 people that you will actually physically see between now and the election who are not here. We have the exactly the same interest you do in the outcome of the election and who may not go if you don't personally ask them and tell them what we discussed here. If you want more affordable college homes you got to vote for Julie Render. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies is a really good idea. I don't care what anybody tells you. I'm lazy to just go. I'm lazy to just president. I tried to raise it as twice and the Republicans wouldn't go along with me. And every time I ever tried to raise it I hear the same thing they're saying now all this will be bad for small business and all that's let me tell you something. If we raise an minimum wage tomorrow $20 an hour everything they say is right. That is it would be too much of a joke to the economics system. Nobody's talking about that. But if you raise it to a reasonable amount, if you raise it to a little over $10 it would give up to 40 million Americans of pay raise because a lot of people had right just above the minimum wage we get of pay raise. And what happens? An enormous percentage of those people are working people with little kids. They've got all they can say grace over to support their children and pay their bills. They will go out and spend all that money. The people who sell them whatever it is they buy will have more money. They'll turn around or order more of that and the people that fill the orders they'll be better off. And before you know it, the economy will be growing from the ground up instead of trying to trickle down. Can you tell me? Please, none of this matters that you don't vote. This is your chance. We finally crawled our way out of the hole and we beat 150 year rule by four full years. We are in the best position of any country on the face of the earth to make the most of the 21st century. It is your life, your future and you have to go vote for it by voting for these great people. So vote for Julia Brown. Welcome. Welcome to Ken out of the world. And have a great day for you.",

        "transcript": " Dr. Speaker, I rise this morning to share the story of Judith and her daughter, K.C. Like all mothers, Judith only wants the best for her children. To live a full and purposeful life, the ability to pursue their dreams and reach their utmost potential. However, at a very young age of 11, K.C. was formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This health condition causes K.C. to have uncontrollable mood swings, to perceive reality differently, to see and hear things that aren't there, and to sometimes even become disconnected with reality altogether. It has taken enormous emotional and physical toll on K.C. and her family. As a mom of two kids, I cannot imagine the difficulties that Judith has faced. Some nights, Judith had to hold her daughter tightly all night long to help her through her psychosis and her panic. Not to mention the emergency hospitalizations, living with this condition has been a life-long struggle for K.C. and for her family. It requires a combination of daily medications, weekly psychiatric treatments, hospital visits, and constant support in medical care. And that's only half the story. Without this intensive treatment, K.C. would simply be unable to function. With it, she has the tools she needs to live a healthy and productive life. When K.C. was younger, she was covered by a family health care policy. But even then, Judith needed to pinch pennies and barely scrape by due to the high cost of insurance copays and deductibles, costing her $13 to $15,000 per month. To try to keep up with her never-ending medical bills, Judith used all of her retirement savings. When K.C. reached adulthood, she was bumped off the family insurance plan. Fortunately, K.C. qualified for health care coverage through the ACA Medicaid expansion. Without it, she and her family would have had no viable alternative. The ACA provided K.C. with access to reliable, consistent medical care that has been vital to her well-being and has allowed her to thrive. And I am very happy to share that K.C. finished her bachelor's degree in May. And is now pursuing her master's in counseling psychology. With her own struggles as her inspiration, she decided to make psychology her life's work. And Judith says that K.C. is now the person that everybody goes to any time they have a problem or need comfort. Without the health care coverage that K.C. obtained from the Affordable Care Act, she would never have been able to obtain private health insurance due to her preexisting conditions and rigorous health needs. With the Affordable Care Act, Judith was able to see her daughter realize her dreams. I know all of you who are parents want the same for your children. But when I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about eliminating K.C.'s health care coverage, I get a pit at the bottom of my stomach. This is not about politics. This is about people's lives. This is about K.C.'s life and Judith's life and the lives of 20 million Americans who have gained health care coverage because of the Affordable Care Act. Today I rise to speak up for K.C. and for Judith and for the millions of other Americans whose lives would be put in jeopardy if we repeal the ACA without an adequate replacement. I urge my Republican colleagues to reconsider this reckless repeal that would throw our entire health care system into chaos and take life saving care away from those who need it the most.",

        "transcript": " Tom Congressman Brad Sherman from California's best name city, Sherman Oaks. For 25 years I've served on the House for Affairs Committee, where I'm now the most senior Democrat. And I want to thank you for inviting me to participate in this webinar, protecting the Lebanese people from conflict. It's an honor to be with Bishop Zaidan, and a pleasure to be with with Kofiq who's been a good friend for many years. And whenever he suggests I do something, goes somewhere, or work on legislation, I can't imagine a time when I haven't agreed with him. I want to thank in defense of Christians for awarding me the Congressional Champion Award recently for my work of religious freedom, particularly in the Middle East. I have fought for formal recognition of the persecution faced by Christian communities in the birthplace of Christianity of the Middle East, whether that be the Kofi Christians, where I've confronted several different foreign ministers to presidents of Egypt over the years, whether that be, of course, recognizing the Armenian genocide, whether that be being the Chief Democratic sponsor of House Resolution 1170, supporting the Koptic Christians in Egypt, and calling on that government to protect the Christian community. Today we're focusing on Lebanon, and particularly the Lebanese Maronite Patriarchs call for a policy of peace, unity, and legality in Lebanon. Lebanon is facing a dire and worsening economic, political, and humanitarian crisis. People see that on the streets every day where the currencies dropped by 129 percent less than two years. Furthermore, we're reminded often not only of the physical damage done by the poor explosion, but the damage that it's done to cohesion in the country and to the support people have for its institutions. Then there's the blackouts, shortages, no doubt, no doubt there are many reasons for this crisis of faith in the Lebanese government. According to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service, which is our advisors are non-partisan advisors in Congress. If the economic conditions continue to deteriorate, this could trigger a humanitarian crisis, both of existing Syrian refugee population and the Lebanese citizens. At a time like this, every leader in Lebanon should say that the last thing Lebanon needs is another crisis, an international crisis, on its southern border. What Hezbollah has done is try to hone in and insert itself in what is basically a realistic dispute involving a dozen or so homes. I'm an old Los Angeles lawyer. I've been involved in many real estate disputes. This case, it's an dispute over whether a dozen or so families need to pay rent or they don't have to pay rent. I have never seen thousands of rockets be used as a target in the litigation. Israel has already endured over 4,000 rockets coming in from the south. It's hard to say that dozens or hundreds more coming from the north would have any different effect on Israeli Israeli actions. Israel will defend itself. It will respond. But it's not going to override what its Supreme Court does for 4,000 rockets or 40 rockets. What Hezbollah is trying to do is create civilian casualties. Can they kill one or two Israeli civilians? Can they begin hostilities so that they can bring cameras to show Lebanese civilian deaths? To deliberately create civilian deaths on both sides for political purposes is shameful. But it's what you'd expect from Hezbollah. This is after all an organization which is a terrorist organization and of course a proxy for a ran of the world's largest and most important state sponsor of terrorism. The United States has recognized Hezbollah as a terrorist organization for decades. And our European friends used to have this dance where they talk about the Hezbollah military wing and the Hezbollah political which is simply absurd. It would be like a convicting a murderer's right hand while claiming his left hand was innocent. Hezbollah is one organization. Lebanon is now facing truly complex and serious challenges. The Maronite Patriarch has again called for a peaceful pass forward and has urged Lebanon's leadership to adopt a logic of peace and the interest of Lebanon and all Lebanese. The US continues to support the Lebanese people. I recently was a strong supporter of the appropriations bill which passed the House providing assistance to the people of Lebanon and noting that the country's ongoing political crisis and instability means that America has to step forward to support the legitimate activities of the Lebanese Armed Forces in combating the influence of Hezbollah and other terrorist groups. I want to commend the Patriarch. Clearly what he has done is in the interests of the people of Lebanon in the interests of the rule of law and clearly what he's done is courageous given the fact that a terrorist organization which has killed tens of thousands of people if not more are now implying if not stating that they have drawn a target on the patriarch. Of course an attack on the patriarch is not just an attack on a man. It is not even just an attack on an institution. It is an attack on Christians in Lebanon and again the right of religious freedom for people in the least. The deepening crisis in Lebanon is a call to action. The international community needs to stand with the Patriarch in his call for peace and urging that Lebanese institutions put the Lebanese people first. I want to thank in defense of Christians for convening this conference focusing our attention on these important issues. I'm Congressman Brad Sherman and I'm very proud to stand with you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " My name is Karen Kenney. I'm coordinator for the San Fernando Valley Patriots here in the United States. And while I do appreciate that you've read the bill of 2000 pages, it's the 19,000 pages of regulations under the Affordable Care Act that need scrutiny. That being said, when I spoke to your colleagues in the ways of means in June, regarding one of the key scandals in Washington right now, what struck me as I watched your website and other congressional websites is that you have an opportunity here to be a voice for clarity regarding ethics, equal application of the law and transparency regarding all of these scandals, IRS, AV, NSA, all of them. And I wonder what's keeping you up to it. I thank you for thinking that I can play that big national role. I try to speak out on the right side. I guess our webpage could use a bit more up-to-date content, but in terms of speaking out on the issues I think are important. I think we're here and I'm doing that right now. As to the NSA, I voted for the Amash amendment. As for Obamacare, I'll take a minute on that. There's a lack of focus on how the system was deteriorating before the health care act was passed or the Obamacare Act was passed. The first, a couple of things to keep in mind. First, this whole controversy is not about staying well, which is probably more important than the kind of medical care you get. I would trade my right to go see a physician for the next 12 months if I could lose about 20 pounds. I haven't done scientific work on that, but I bet you all that the 20 pounds is going to cost me more longevity than all the doctors I see in the next year are going to add to it. So we need to focus on being well rather than just health care. Then on health care, it's the efficiency of the overall health care system. The prices just keep going up and up. So much health care is provided in the last six months of life compared to everything else. There are a lot of things about the health care system that ought to be improved. All of our political attention is on health insurance, which is just how to pay for it. As to the health insurance problem, before Obamacare, we had a system that was unraveling in here, so I went unraveling. We had about 30, 35 million on a matured people. So they waited till they got sick and they went to the emergency room. And then if you've ever seen a bill from the emergency room, it's 5,000 is the starting point. Then it goes up from there. So you send a $5,000 bill to somebody who didn't have enough money by health insurance. They're not going to pay it. They can't possibly pay it. So what does the hospital do? It writes off the bill. So now the hospital is stuck by five or 10 or 15 grand of uncompensated care. Every time somebody comes to the emergency room doesn't have a car. So what do they do? They raise their prices on everybody else. Now they ask for costs $11 instead of paying for the health care. What does that do? It raises the amount they charge to Blue Cross for those who are insurance. So what does Blue Cross and the other insurance companies do? Well, they raise their rates and then what do they do after that? They say we just raised our rates to cover the additional cost. How about some profits? So they raise their rates a little bit beyond then. Now you have employers and people don't see this because employers are paying 50, 80% of the cost. The employer gets to go, oh my god, it's looking at how the health care cost has gone up. So what do they do? Well, many of the pay. But a few of them say, okay, we're just not going to provide health care. And so now you have 37 million people in employment. Now you are uncovered. Those people go to the emergency room. They get the uninsured coverage. The hospital paid has more people providing thousands of dollars of care for which they're not paying. They raise the price of the ask for the $17 per ask. Blue Cross and other insurance companies raise their rates so that they raise them again. More companies drop. That cycle was in full swing in 2000 and in 2009. It had we simply kept what we had. We could not have kept what we had. Tell about the base. The that system was unraveling. The only way we're going to be able to provide health care for every American who has the right to show up on the emergency room is to make sure that everybody has coverage. I know. I'm really a step we need to have to see. Excuse me. I'm a little bit of a ruck. And if. Hey for every guy. And hello. Hello. Oh, the answer is no doubt. Shut down for a get out. There's a little first amendment champion over there. This is our town hall. The people who should be speaking or those who are recognized for the floor. If somebody wants to speak at great length, they should put their own town hall. And I'll do what I can with the commuter charter high school to give anyone else here their own form. You don't hijack somebody else's form. Now let's so the point I'm making is the system we had before was not just bad for the 35 million you didn't have coverage. I didn't bring any. So if you got from any had an emergency, you show up in an emergency room that's crowded with a bunch of people who wouldn't be there. If only they had the coverage to go somewhere else. Yeah. You have a hospital raising its rates dramatically every year. You have dramatic increases. And it's easy to say, well, I don't care about those 35 million people that don't have coverage. They're still on short. The way that system was going, it was going to be 70, 80, and a lot of people in this room that half coverage today and thought the old system was just great. Even their employer was paying almost all the cost. They didn't think it was that expensive. A lot of those folks would have found themselves among the uninsured. So the old system wasn't working. The new system has some bugs. Let's go on to the next question. Oh.",

        "transcript": " So let's talk about this and more. I want to bring in our Congressman Brad Sherman. He's a Democrat from California, and the senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a Clinton supporter. Welcome, sir. Good to be with you. Will you meet with Secretary Clinton today? Absolutely, just as soon as we're done with this interview. And what will that be like? What will you guys talk about? Well, this is going to be at Pepper Alley, as your reporter said. Not almost all of us have been with Hillary from the beginning, and those who are with Bernie are now with Hillary. And this is going to be a chance for us to get fired up and ready to go. And also to talk about some of the finer points of the campaign. And especially how the presidential campaign can also help us take back the House of Representatives. Donald Trump is doing so poorly, that's a possibility. Will you be watching Mr. Trump's speech? I will actually be in the room with Chairman Yellen of the Federal Reserve Board. And that'll be a little bit more policy-oriented than what Mr. Trump has to say. So you'll be busy working in other words. Mr. Trump's speech, though, it's expected to be no holds barred. Mr. Trump has already responded to Clinton's claims that he profited from debt at the expense of working people. Listen. Hillary Clinton's only right about one thing. I understand debt and how to handle it. I've made a fortune with debt. But debt for this country is a disaster. And Obama has piled it on, and she's been there watching. Mr. Trump told ABC he was simply using the laws on the books as any good businessman would. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with it is when he refuses to pay the small businesses that help build his buildings. When he stiffs plumbers, when he stiffs painters, and then hides behind the fact that I'm rich, I've got a lot of lawyers. You can't sue me. You don't have illegal counsels. So I think that that's not the way most people do business, and it's certainly not the way the United States can do business. He has talked about putting our full faith and credit on the line and not honoring US debts. That would be such an incredible disaster for the world economy. Because while hundreds of years ago, gold was the standard. Now the standard is US government bonds. And the entire world economy is dependent upon the full faith and credit of the United States, which should never be put at risk. Mr. Trump will also likely hammer Mrs. Clinton and her husband and how much money they made in speaking fees, allegedly fueled by Clinton's time in the state. Amendment. CNN found between 2001 and 2015. The Clinton's earned more than $153 million for 729 separate speeches. Some of those speeches were delivered to groups with ties to foreign countries. Mr. Trump will likely charge Clinton, turned the state department into what he calls a private hedge fund. Why is he wrong? Presidents have been giving speeches after they have left office, certainly since Ronald Reagan, who received a much bigger speaking fee when he went to Japan than anything that I think any president has earned since. Now it's true that President Clinton has given probably and Secretary Clinton had probably given more speeches. They've worked hard at it. But in terms of what people are willing to pay to bring to their audience a former president of the United States, there are groups that are willing to pay a lot. And they certainly paid Ronald Reagan a lot more than they pay Hillary or Bill. But what's their $153 million? Isn't it time that Hillary Clinton released the transcripts of those wall street speeches? When that put this matter to rest? I'm sure that would do nothing to put the matter to rest just because Trump will never rest. He is negatives are so extreme. He's called by Speaker Ryan a textbook racist. He will do nothing but attack, attack, attack. The Clinton's have been under attack for 25 years. And of course Trump will try to continue that. The problem he has is. It's all on the table. Want to put voters' minds to rest if Hillary Clinton released the transcripts of those speeches after all Bernie Sanders called for her to do that? Yes, in a primary many things happen. But the fact is that she has given thousands of speeches that are on the record. We know what she has to say. We know what her positions are. And of course her webpage lays out her positions for the future. You go to the Trump webpage and all you see is attacks. All you see is is is is bio. We need a positive prescription for the future of the history for the future of this country. And you'll see that in Hillary's program. Let me ask you this. Mark Zandy, the well respected economist, determined Mr. Trump's economic plan would be disastrous for the country. But he donated money to Mrs. Clinton and to Republican John McCain. And he was a guest speaker for the Clinton Global Initiative. Mr. Trump will surely bring this up. How should voters take the Zandy report? They should say that Mr. Zandy knows something about economics, but so do thousands of other economists in this country. And they've all reached the same conclusion. And that is that we better not let Trump's hands on to this economy. But should voters worry about these donations from Mr. Zandy to Mrs. Clinton and to John McCain, who's no huge fan of Donald Trump? It's clear that Mr. Zandy has put a little bit of money where his mouth is. I don't think that he's, that the amounts of the contributions are significant. You can't say that Zandy controls the Clinton campaign because he's donated $1,000 or $2,000. But it does show that he is so motivated that he's willing to put his money where his mouth is. And he speaks not yet. He's a centrist economist. The vast majority of economists in this country, they make quibble with Hillary's plan. But they all agree. Trump is a complete disaster. And I'm glad that Zandy's enough of a patriot to try to do just a little something with his own money to prevent that disaster. All right. Congressman Brad Sherman. Thanks for.",

        "transcript": " Hillary Clinton disavowing support from the Orlando attack her father after he attended a rally this week, her rally, and saying she didn't even know he was there raising more questions about just how to touch in her campaign really are to democratic countries for Brad Sherman on how this affects her as she tries to shift the focus to the economy. At the very least, sorry, you have to admit the optics are really bad and you're comments are just ridiculous. A deranged man sneaks into the bleachers that happens at every Yankee game to the front seats. Not the front seats well back anybody shows up. Look, we're putting on political rallies the Yankees are putting on a baseball game. Do you think there couldn't be a deranged person in the front row of the bleachers? We're talking about a well-honed presidential campaign event. The Yankees are a well-honed baseball team but they don't vet everybody's comes to the game. That is so intellectually dishonest with all due respect. You can come up with something better than that. This is absolutely ridiculous. You invite the public to come to a rally. The people who show up first get good seats. So, and nothing is rallying. There's nothing designed for the optics. I've seen rallies where the topics were women and there were a bunch of women in a background where the topics were minorities and there were a bunch of minorities in a background where the top. I mean, let's be honest about this. Look, stop calling me a liar. The fact is that a political rally has been in the front row. You're saying for fact none of these, the people sitting directly behind the candidate are never vetted? In a bleacher situation and I hope you show the picture. We're assuming you have a number of people on the stage are vetted. But when you have a huge rally most of the time, you don't vet the people who are there. And I've had lots of friends get good seats at political rallies just by showing up early. I will tell you that you can be on stage. It's really scary that he's several seats behind the presidential candidate. Well, that's why we have a secret service and you'll remember that there was an incident they went after, where somebody went after Trump. The fact is neither Trump nor Hillary can control who is in the arena. They both have huge arenas and the Yankees can't do it either. And that's why when we have these large events, we need to have security there. I guarantee it won't happen again for Hillary Clinton. I guarantee this accident won't happen again. I know that much won't happen again. I assure you that crazy people will sneak in to these rallies. Not the well-known father of a mass murderer. I don't think that's going to happen again. If it does, we'll say it'll be some other deranged person. Somebody, I mean, we could look at the thousand worst crimes that have happened this year. Look at the parents of the people who committed those crimes. You or I couldn't pick them out of the lineup. Those people can sneak into political rallies or Yankees. It's a man who has thrust it himself into the public spotlight on more than one of these days. And people know that whatever it is, whatever his sickness is that perhaps he passed on to his son, he likes the limelight. Now, the fact that no one caught him, I just say it's a big mistake for Hillary Clinton. Now, that is the desperate line of a campaign in free fall, a campaign that flirts with David Duke supporters and seeks racist votes and then tries to conflate that with who sneaks into the rally. If David Duke was planning to welcome the support of David Duke since you brought him up with standing at a rally with Donald Trump, you would lose the rest of your hair right now. You would set yourself on fire. The mainstream media would run with it and say Donald Trump knew it's not in the back of the bleachers at a Yankee game or to be talking about Yankee game. We're talking about political events for the highest office in the land that are highly concentrated and controlled. The World Series is a well run event and there'll be a crazy person in the bleachers there. We do not have, when you have mass rallies, you can say, oh, it's the highest office in the land. The highest baseball game in the land will attract thousands of people. Do you think that there's going to be a vetting? Do you think there's going to be guards looking at the face of everybody who comes in? Absolutely. You buy a ticket, you show up at the rally. There's serious vetting going on at presidential events and who stands behind the candidate and the optics of it. Who stands behind or portray it in the live live? You're lying in the way you phrase that. Stands behind or the ten people that you might put on stage to stand you behind a rally. Standing in the, sitting in the bleachers or standing in the bleachers is the way you've got to describe it because you're, and because you're so desperate to support a deranged presidential candidate. A man whose narcissism and racism is so well documented that you're trying to complete the bleachers with the stage. I'm going to just tell you right now, sir, all you're doing is making that candidate more sympathetic to the public who haven't made up their mind just yet. That's all I'm telling you. There are some things that have been very fair, some things that aren't. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? The double standard would be more to say it was a mistake, but perhaps someone or her team should have caught this guy. The double standard is when you can insult John McCain, a hero, and not immediately withdraw from the race. The press has done a double standard aid to McCain because he's good rallies and he makes a lot of money. Gold star parents insulted any other person in politics would be outright away. Well, we'll press some up because you're making money off of him. The news of the week and you gave your opinion and I do appreciate it. But I will make a wager with you. We'll never happen again because it does not look good for the candidate and it's probably not safe for the candidate either. Congressman Sherman, thank you very much. We rely on metal detectors for safety in the Secret Service. Thank you very much.",

        "transcript": " And we are back at the rocking, rockest lit grill. And Phil Dalpia, Pennsylvania's Democratic National Convention. Welcome back everyone. I hope you're enjoying our coverage. President Barack Obama is saying no one is more qualified. No one. More qualified to be president than Hillary Clinton. I want to bring in Congress and Brad Sherman of California, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. And of course my dream team is back with me. Political commentator Peter Bynard, a contributor to the Atlantic, Kaley McIntyre, a Donald Trump supporter, political commentator Angela Rye, and also Bacardi Sellers, a Hillary Clinton supporter. Thank you, Congress. It'll be for Bain with us. This was another big moment I want you to listen and get your response to it. Here it is. Watch this. And most of all, I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together. Black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance under the same proud flag to this big, bold country that we love. That's what I see. That's the America I know. And there is only one candidate who believes in that future has devoted her life to that future, a mother and a grandmother who would do anything to help our children thrive. A leader with real plans to break down barriers and blast through glass ceilings. And widen the circle of opportunity to every single American, the next president of the United States, Hillary Clinton. So, Congress, in which a reaction, one of inclusion instead of exclusion? I think the president showed that the America of the future is consistent with the values of America of the past, that we can all embrace the America of the future. And I think he said it very well. What was your reaction tonight to the President's speech and then Hillary Clinton coming on say? Well, the President's speech was inspirational. One of his best. The night in the day was just an outstanding one for our candidacy. We had a flawless day of a convention, an inspirational day. And then Donald Trump said something even stupider than he usually does with this request that the Russians get involved in our political process. So Peter, I want to, you mentioned President Ronald Reagan. And then John, that hurts, Pondhurtz, right, was a Reagan speech writer. He asked me at this night, he said, take about five paragraphs out of that Obama speech and it could have been a Reagan speech. Trust me, I know. What do you think of that? Yeah, what I think Obama did was fascinating and Congressman Sherman mentioned it is, Donald Trump is peddling nostalgia. He's peddling nostalgia for people who think that America was, you know, hit its high point in 1985 or 1955 and has been on the downhill ever since. And Barack Obama was saying, we can honor the past, the my canns and ancestors and their values. But America doesn't, we don't lose those just because a lot of Mexicans and Muslims come in and because American Americans get empowered. Those values are universal. Just because we've removed the past doesn't mean that we lose it when the demographic face of America changes. And that I think was in a way a very powerful response to Donald Trump and it was a personal response. Because remember, Donald Trump questioned his Americanism, questioned whether he was really an American. He said, I am the grandson of Kansas, Kansas. I have a black father and a Muslim name and I grew up in Indonesia, but I embody those same values. Yeah. I, Kayleigh, I want to get your reaction to this moment. Hillary's been in the room. She's been part of those decisions. She knows what's at stake in the decisions our government makes. She's a stake for the work and family, for the senior citizen, for the small business owner, for the soldier, for the veteran. And even in the midst of crisis, she listens to people and she keeps her cool and she treats everybody with respect. And no matter how daunting the odds, no matter how much people try to knock her down, she never, ever quits. That is the Hillary I know. That's the Hillary I've come to admire. And that's why I can say with confidence, there has never been a man or a woman. Not me, not Bill, nobody, more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America. So Donald Trump has never been in the room. How does he convince voters at Secretary Clinton's experiences and valuable? Well, I wouldn't want Donald Trump to be in the room of the people who orchestrated this foreign policy. I mean, the fact speaks for themselves. This is called ISIS JV. He said al-Qaeda is on the run. And then ISIS grew to 40,000 strong. We have the ISIS terrorist attack every 84 hours. Hillary Clinton called Bashir al-Assad a reformer before he proceeded to gas his own people and this administration oversaw the destruction of Syria and the rise of ISIS. I don't want Donald Trump in the room with these folks. I want someone with a different vision with executive capacity and that's what Donald Trump has. So I just think that it's important for us to acknowledge and other fervent you after this one point. Again, I'm going to continue to go back to Congress and Congressman, I know you'll appreciate this. I've never requested military authorizations and his continued military force against ISIL. He was not granted that. It wasn't even considered. He's been asking for it since February 2015. The President's lawyers have said that the existing authorization to use force passed in 2001 gives him the authority to do everything he's doing. Absolutely. And what we couldn't agree upon was a replacement. As a matter of fact, he did not ask for repeal and replace of that very broad resolution we passed in 2001. So he's got the authorization. But can you go back to what you just said? You said you couldn't agree on. Before you came on set, my only point is that at every turn he's faced opposition and it's made it very difficult to accomplish some of the things before like this. Just to kind of go just one step further and look at this from a 50,000 foot view. I mean, I understand what Kayleigh was saying earlier, but that doesn't actually give credit to the President and the Secretary of State John Kerry and others because every day we're bombing the hell out of ISIL and every day ISIL is losing ground. We do know that. But even more importantly, the sub in mind, we're not experiencing thousands of casualties every year. And most of our, and we're brave. We did under drug law and we've pushed and we've let them do the damage. We're managing the problem without thousands of our uniform men and women dying. That matters. And by negotiating the Iran deal, we make, we allow ourselves to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon without a third of Middle Eastern war. So Tom, I think we'll go down. I know you were opposed to it, but most Democrats support it. The Barack Obama, I think, will go down like the White Eisenhower, a man who at the height of the Cold War, when people were pushing him to get into Vietnam, when people were pushing him to reckless interventions, avoided doing so, and we'll look back kindly on history. Hold on, McCarty. Someone get the congressman. I've got to be here all night. Go ahead. Final words on this subject that we're, final words on what? On this subject that we've been discussing. Look. You can't just put Donald in power and he'll just pound the table and ISIS will go away. Radical Islamic extremism is going to be with us for a while. It needs to be managed. It needs to be gained. It needs to be driven down. Even when you crush it, some of it comes out of your fingers. And in order to avoid putting ground troops in and losing thousands and creating more terrorists, you need a calm hand. That's what Hillary provides. Congressmen, thank you very much. We'll get the congressman back. Everybody else stay with me. Much more to come. Are you going to stay around? You're staying around. Much more to come live from the scene and grow here in Philadelphia. The Democratic Commission. Don't go anywhere.",

        "transcript": " Mr. Speaker, yesterday the students of Huguenot High School in Richmond, Virginia celebrated their graduation. Moments after the ceremony ended, as friends and family gathered outside for hugs and selfies, gunshots rang out. Panic ensued. When the dust settled, a graduate, Sean Jackson was dead. He was 18 years old. Sean's stepfather, he came to celebrate with him. Renzo Smith was dead. He was 36 years old. Five additional people were shot. Other sustained injuries, including Rayna Jackson Smith. Sean's nine-year-old sister, who was hit by a car while fleeing scene. Richmond police have a suspect in custody. He is 19 years old. He knew the victim. He and Sean were an ongoing dispute. We should not have to live like this. What should have been the happiest day of those kids' lives turned into every parent's worst nightmare. These kids saw their freshman year cut short by COVID. They should have felt the joy yesterday and last night of graduating. Instead, their final memory of high school is marred forever by trauma. The active shooter drills that they endured throughout their school years did not prepare them for shooting at their graduation. They were in a public park in the grocery store at a theater at their house of worship, at a concert, at a mall, walking down the street on a highway in their home. Where are they safe? My son asked me this every time that there is a shooting on the news. Three months ago today, when I stood at this very spot to take my oath of office, you saw my son and daughter standing proudly beside me. You saw how excited my son was. You saw his dance moves. Four days later, one of his classmates shot himself accidentally with a gun he was using in a prop to record a video. He died. Last night, my husband and I had to tell our children that they are not going to school today and possibly for the rest of the year because of a shooting at a graduation less than a mile from our home. Every time there is a shooting, we go through this same routine. Every time my son is afraid, wondering, will he be next? And I hug him and I say, I am doing everything within my power to keep you safe. As a state legislator in Virginia, I was proud to pass several pieces of gun violence prevention measures to do just that, including securing $12 million in funding to invest in our communities to address the root causes of gun violence. I was excited to see this Congress pass the first piece of substantive gun violence legislation in 30 years in a bipartisan measure. So you can imagine my disgust and my sorrow when after the Tennessee school shooting, one of our colleagues, one of our Republican colleagues in an interview on television said, we are not going to do anything. That is unacceptable. We must take action to address the root causes of gun violence. To ban assault weapons, implement universal background checks, gun storage, among other common sense measures that are popular with an overwhelming majority of voters according to Fox News polling. I came here to solve problems. I came here to save lives. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. It is past time for action. Today, I'm more in the lives lost in my district, my city, my school division, my neighborhood. Today, I seek to comfort their loved ones and those traumatized by the terror they felt last night. Today, I can recommit to doing everything within my power to make sure that this never happens again. Enough is enough. And I'm begging my colleagues in this body do something. Mr. Speaker, I yield back.",

        "transcript": " Hello, welcome to the Billy Wilder Theatre. I'm Claudia Bester. I am the Director of Public Programs here at the Hammer Museum. And I'm very, very pleased to welcome you to tonight's special program called Harriet's Political Will, Black Women's Electural Strength in an era of fractured politics. Tonight's program is part of a week-long program on the status of Black Women called her Dream Deferred, organized in collaboration with the African-American Policy Forum. Tonight's program has two parts. First, we'll get to see a short play about Harriet Tubman and her legacy. And immediately afterwards, we'll have a panel on Black Women as a driving force in the fight for equality and justice. The panelists are all political heavyweights if they're if they're on right. Attorney Barbara Arnwine, Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, CNN, political senior senior political reporter Nea Malika Henderson, California State Assemblymember Sydney Kamlager Dove, and moderator Kimberly Crenshaw. And now I'd like to welcome the brainchild of her dream deferred to the stage to introduce the play we're about to see. Please join me in welcoming the Executive Director of the African-American Policy Foundation and Professor of Law at UCLA in Columbia Law School, Kimberly Crenshaw. Good evening. It is a distinct pleasure to be with you tonight and to share a labor of love on the part of the African-American Policy Forum and our friends here at the Hammer Museum. The piece that you are about to see was created over a period of a couple of months with some wonderful artists that I will introduce to you during our panel discussion. But I wanted to give you a little bit of the context of this piece. Some of you might remember that a couple years ago it was announced that Harriet Tubman's face was going to grace the $20 bill. That was a moment that we celebrated. And at the same time I thought it was really odd and ironic that her face would be on the $20 bill, basically because Harriet died absolutely destitute. And in fact, one of the struggles that she had for much of her life after the end of the Civil War was to get paid. It was a constant focal point of her life. And the reason she wanted to get paid was that she understood that the pathway to freedom was only partially walked by the emancipation proclamation by the end of the Civil War by the 13th Amendment. There was much more that was necessary. And she was a person who very much wanted to create a home, a place for the dispossessed to find safety, to find support, to just be clothed and fed. And unlike some of the male leaders of the Civil War and during the period of reconstruction, Harriet didn't really get the same kind of resources that they got in order to carry her vision forward. In fact, when she finally was able to receive some kind of compensation, she didn't get full compensation for all the things that she had done. She didn't get compensation for recruiting a freedman to fight for the union cause. She didn't get it for being a scout, for organizing raids, for going behind enemy lines or being a medic. She didn't really get resources for that. What she was primarily able to get resources as was a wife of a private who was in the union. And that really stuck with me because at the time we were having a lot of discussions and debates about the racial justice project of the then Obama administration, which didn't have black women or women of color at the center of it. So the basic idea was that black women's economic development would be dependent upon their relationship to someone else in the same way that Harriet Tubman's was. So I thought it was such an interesting contradiction that on one hand, her picture was on a $20 bill. The plans were that. And on the other hand, the economic well-being of black women was still being framed in a heteronormative patriarchal way. So it made me wonder what Harriet would have to say if she came back now. What lessons would she try to teach young black women right now? And what is the legacy that she gives to us now? So when we first put this on, we did it in like three days and it kind of looked like it. Now we have had the benefit of a wonderful partnership with the Hammer Museum. So it is my great pleasure to present to you, Harriet's daughters. Thank you. And in the middle we have the statue of Harriet Tubman. Okay. Time to move on to the kiln today. Harriet Tubman. 1824 through 1913. Moses, the general, conductor of the underground railroad, freed over 70 slaves. I could have freed a lot more if they'd only known there were slaves. Now I heard that. You ain't never lied, Ms. Tubman. That's right. Never have and never will. Of course, they're messophobes that think they're free or it defines how too late that there's not like my sorry husband, John Tubman, fool. When all the way back brought him a fine suit, a smart hat will look better than the day we were married. But he didn't want no part of freedom. They didn't want no part of me either. Broke me in two. Well that's a story I can't worry about right now. Got a tenders and business. Now what year are we in? Harriet? I mean, Ms. Tubman, is that you? Of course, who else could I be? Now we are a bit lost, don't resist. But don't you worry. Mother Harriet is here. Now where are you off to? Well, Mother Harriet, I was just looking around, going nowhere in particular. I feel like we're moving. You want to sit down sister. Moving backwards. No way in particular. I ain't never had no way in particular to be. I can't remember a time that I didn't have a bushel of jobs and a whole bunch of stuff to do. By the time I was 19, I had worked from son up to sundown for 13 years. By then I figured I'd hide myself away from my master, which I did. Saved up enough to buy two oxen and I broke facts and I cleaned houses and I made bricks and I freed slaves and I, where were I, I, I, I, what else did I do? Fed armies tended wounds. Blood rays. Blood rays. And in all this time, I'd never got around wondering around aimlessly myself. Oh, but if you're looking to find yourself daughter, the mother Harriet is here and I'm here to help you sit on your way. Mother Harriet, I, I, I, I, how's this possible for you to be here or, or made to be in 1886? Why? I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I can't say. But I did have a vision that there was something going on down here big related to mother Harriet's money and I figure all those white folks won't give me what I'm do. That's what made the earth shatter and whatnot. And then all the thunder and enlightenment. I bet it's all the mother white folks rolling in their graves. So with all this shaken and rolling, I think we're in a time flux and I'm going to go back and set things straight. That's what I'm going to do. Okay. Well, mother Harriet's getting paid and while we're at it, we're going to get some things straight. Oh, I think I know what you're talking about. Here. Look, sure. Now, would you go and show me this? Look, I think this is what you saw. You're on our $20 bill. That's your currency now. Well, not your currency, but this is to honor you. A $20 bill. My, my father paid $20 to get my mother away from messing with. She couldn't work. A $20 bill. That's what the government think I'm worth. That's what they're going to pay me as a veteran of the war. Well, in the funny, how it was worth more when we were owned by slaves, when we were owned by a massive, then we were owned right by ourselves. Lincoln paid a whole bunch of money to get rid of us. And then once we were free, weren't worth a dime. And we weren't worth a dime to ourselves either. Well, I might not have no money, but I did have sense enough. Oh, here, here, and even my white friends like to say, you ignorant. But I had sense enough to get my family free and a whole bunch of others too. Right under their noses. Got them all except my sister, her babies. But I'm going back to fix that right now. Do that for me, sister. Now, now you let me know when that thing gets back to where I'm 1858. We'll do. You know, there are a whole lot of folks who are literate. And they don't know how to do squat. But mother Harriet, how did you manage to get free and go back again and again and why risk it? Okay, okay, now listen now. You just got to be ready. Pay attention and use the fact that they can see right through you to your advantage. Do you know how many times I went back? Well, right by a mess. Now he didn't see me. I'm by him. No one can see me that I don't want to. Happened, you figured that out already. Now, boo, honey, child. Wait a minute now. My son can't go up my skirt falling down. That's not going to work. Let me show you something else. You see this? What? What? BABOOM! I got one for you over here. Oh, you did that for me. Thank you. Now, listen, my sister is going to be on the auction block this Sunday. And this is my last chance to get her. Now, listen, you put this in your bag. You got a bag. You don't have a bag. We're going to get you a bag. You put that one in your bag. Oh, and come on. We've got to get it before the auction block. Let's go. hmm oh You ready? You ready? Always ready? You ready? Always ready? Always ready? Always ready? You ready? You ready? Always ready? In the water? Wait in the water, children, way in the water God's gonna trouble the water, swing low, sweet sharia Come and for the carry me home, swing low, sweet sharia Go down Moses, tell the Pharaoh to let my people go You ready? You ready? You ready? You ready? You ready? You ready? You ready? You ready? You ready? You ready? You ready? You ready? Ah! Ah! Ah! Please, Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh, dear, Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Ah! Ah! Ah! Mother Harriet, the war has been over 30 years now. It's 1895. You remained a general and conductor of the underground railroad, freed more than 700 slaves and recruited most all the men to the Union side to vote. Yeah! Still waiting on the money put here for that to. You saved the commander and all of them that had the fever with your root medicine. You haven't been paid for that. Had a network of spies to keep up with the Confederate movements and even behind Confederate movements, you're... You've been more to being paid for a widow from my second husband, a private than I got for being a veteran myself. You are waiting to be paid what is yours. Yeah, and not just for me. But for all those women and men who come out of slavery who have nothing to name. What now, Mother Harriet, for now, sweetie. You can take that. And for my daughters, the ones who are always ready. I think you tell them that Mother Harriet is always here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what more say? I gotta give you my show. Here you go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So now I'd like to introduce part two of tonight's special program. We have a panel of brilliant women who are all deeply engaged in contemporary social and political issues.

So now please join me in welcoming Barbara Arnwine, Alicia Garza, Nea Malika Henderson, Sydney Cum Laugh, or Dove and Kimberly Crenshaw. Thank you. Good evening. Well, it is really a special honor to share the stage with some of my heroes. We are really looking forward to an inspired conversation. Before I get started though, there's some people I have to thank. I mentioned that we put this performance together basically in an apartment over a couple of days. And I have my artist and residents to thank for that. Dina Wright-Josef, who was our choreographer, Fiya Walkingtree, who was our conductor of the musicians and Abby Dobson, who you heard her mesmerizing voice. So first wanted to acknowledge their incredible role. I also want to thank Darcy Craiger and Vane Asadarian, who directed this play for us here at the Hammer. It really is a learning for me to see artists at work and how they can bring to life a vision that kind of just sits in your head for a while. So it was really a lot of fun working on this. The entire point of the play is to provide a new predicate or a new point of departure for thinking about the historical legacy of Black women's political struggle and its contemporary dimensions. We've gotten together to talk a little bit about some of the resonances of Harriet's legacy for today. And part of that conversation involves looking very closely at what is unfolding now in the country as we're moving to 2020. So I wanted to start, first of all, by just giving us a little bit of an opportunity to think back about what was resonant in this particular performance and what we can bring forward. So Barbara, I'm going to start with you. So next year will be the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. This is a moment where history is making itself. I guess present we have all kinds of celebrations that are happening all over the place. It is the women's hour as we were told somewhat in contrast to the line in the play where Harriet talks about Frederick Douglass saying it's the Negroes hour. So there was a Negroes hour and then there was a women's hour and I'm wondering when was the Black women's hour? I think that the bad news, everyone, is that as people will gather next year in 2020 to celebrate the 100, I say you've got a minus 45 because it would take black women another 45 years to get the right to vote. Even though black women were at the forefront of the suffragous movement and were outspoken about the right of women to vote and their stories, I'd be well Barnett and so many others, their amazing stories of their struggle, they will tell you a course that they were told to march at the back of the line behind the white women doing the various suffragous movement marches, yet our sisters being sisters, they came to the front and took their place. Now they could not change that when it came to all these states that were engaging in that era of voter suppression. I think also people need to know that even before we got to the women's vote that Harriet Tubman, even in her destitution in 1896, she is the keynote speaker at the National Black Women's Political Convention. She is the keynote speaker, we are trying to find some record of that speech, but just think about it, that she is still powerful enough to gather women from around the country and to give not just a rendition of her life but a political direction for black women. So that legacy needs to be lifted up. It's gotten lost. It's almost like her story ends the minute the civil war is over, but it didn't. One of my, there's so much, I mean we'll come back to Harriet again because there's so much that she did politically that we ought to learn from now. We'll come back to that, but I just want it to open with that observation that the women's movement will never be whole, will never be complete until it reconciles the true story of its origin and the true story of its betrayal of black women and the true story of the embrace that really has to occur of our agenda and our issues. Thank you. Yes, Barbara, thank you for that. We might linger here for a moment because when we fast forward to the future, we're going to be talking about this thing called the women's vote. We're going to be talking about this notion of is there a political coalition around women's issues and it behooves us to think about that through a historical lens. So we do know that in the aftermath of the 14th and the 15th amendment, there was a split. The suffragettes at some point broke off from the anti-slavery part of the political establishment and not only did they break off, they broke off in a big way and began to say some things that have in some ways hindered coalition between black women and white women for a generation. What's the significance of their breaking off and some of the things that Elizabeth Cady Staggins, Susan B. Anthony had to say about how they felt about black men getting the vote before white women did. Well, they felt that it was really ugly because they said things like these uneducated, unclean black men getting the right to vote before educated, proper white women was just unacceptable. And you don't need what's a really vicious cycle because what we don't hear in any of this debate because the voices of the white women and Susan B. Anthony with this long relationship with Frederick Douglass, you know, it's struggle. We know some of those stories but what we don't have is enough of the record of what black women were saying during that time because that's be straight that it wasn't just white women who were discontented that they were denied the right to vote when black men got the right to vote. We also had some say about that because they wanted to have their power heard also. So what we basically did in response to all of this madness is that we do what we always do. We created our own clubs. We created an entire national movement called the black women's, you know, so, you know, club movement. That was absolutely powerful so that when the 1895 movement of a convention of the national convention of colored women is held in Boston in 1895, there are something like 42 major black women clubs that are represented there from over 18 states and, you know, black women are coming and they are saying powerful messages about their anger at the stereotype. Their anger at the fact that they're called betwixting between. They're called between the white men, white women, and they're called between black men and they, in fact, you know, they're famous, they're famous book titles, all the men are the blacks and men, all the women are white. All the blacks are men and all the women are white and then we're still caught up in that dynamic and that's why your creation of the role concept of intersectionality to put this into context and not only perspective but to really force the policy discussed and we've got to have in this country about how we give full voice and full power to black women. Yes, thank you, Barbara. You know, I'm struck. I'm struck by the vision of the black women's club movement which is often not talked about as a political formation, right? It tends to be talked about as a cultural formation, you know, lifting as we climbed the idea that the work they were doing was domestic but in fact it was very much a political formation and in part the failure to lift that up is a part of the erasure of black women's political history in the same way that Harriet Tubman as a political actor has been erased. So we literally see her like we saw her at the beginning of the play like a statue that sort of her relevant life as a leader ended at the end of the Civil War. So one of the things we seem to be battling now is against the erasure of our history and against the valoration of white women's suffragist history without talking about the racial dimensions of it. So one of the questions then is what is the contemporary dimension of that? And for this, Nea, I want to come to you. In talking about in this current political moment how race and gender dynamics are playing out in political discourse now there's a whole lot of you know projection and discussion about what 2020 looks like. So a lot of times race and gender considerations don't announce themselves in the way people talk about politics but yet there is a sense that actually these are race and gender discourses. So help us decode what's being talked about. Yeah. So the obvious ways race and gender are talked about are the field right. It's a huge field. It's the most diverse field in history. More women, the democratic field, more women running than ever. It's five women. You have Kamala Harris who announces her candidacy with echoes of Shirley Chisholm who of course ran for the White House in 1972. So you have that kind of field represented in a way in which people can easily talk about race and gender. What does this mean? It's reflection of sort of the new woke era right in the democratic party. It's an echo of what we saw in 2018 with all of those candidates in the house being ushered in the most diverse house we've ever seen in terms of the democratic side. Powered there by women, stars who have emerged like ALC and Iana Pressley, Lucy McBath, people like that. So that's one obvious way we talk about it right. The other I think more complicated, less obvious and I think uncomfortable ways in which people are talking about race is this whole idea of electability right. And who are the candidates who are thought of as the electable candidates right. And so I think this is pretty obvious. It's the white male candidates. It's Joe Biden thought of as electable because he supposedly has some magical power in the midwest to have voters who voted for Trump to vote for him. Beto or work, another candidate thought to have this sort of superpower of making Trump voters vote for him. If you look at a lot of the data in Texas, I think you got about 3% of Trump voters. And Stacey Abrams, by the way, got 2% of Trump voters in Georgia. So she apparently doesn't have the same magical power. Beto or work does. I'm not sure why. Yeah, she doesn't have our encounters. And so that is I think the way in which we're talking about electability but it really is about it's always the power of being white, the power of being white in male. And so that I think in some ways I think it's we are at a point at least if you look at a lot of folks who were writing talking on television about this field, there is a way in which we're recognizing and talking about white male identity in a way that we didn't before and in a way that wasn't so comfortable before for a lot of people. One of the ways that people talk about it is this idea that somehow white men are at a disadvantage in this field, right? Because apparently there's a real appetite for an African American woman or a black man or yeah, I mean, which is absurd. The idea that somehow being white in male all of a sudden is a burden, right? It's called white male privilege, right? It's not called white male disadvantage. So, so you know, these are sort of all of the dynamics that are at play in this race that is very much going to be about race and gender. And you know, it's obviously heightened by Donald Trump who talks about race and talks about gender in very obvious ways, right? You think about past or public in candidates. In many ways they basically you know, sort of the dog whistle way of talking about race and gender and if you're Donald Trump, you basically decided to really openly play with white identity politics and you saw that and obviously the returns and some of the anxiety that white voters had about some of the demographic shifts. So, you have, I think in the democratic side, a real reaction to that and a grappling with what it means to be a woke Democrat. You know, what it means to, if you're Joe Biden, like how do you deal with this new era where you have to account for what he did with Anita Hill? Yeah, you know, he keeps talking about this in the same way. He said, you know, well, I owe her an apology and a lot of people are saying, well, you actually didn't apologize to her, right? You know, she's still waiting on that apology. He's talking for instance about violence against women and one of the things he said recently, this was an interview he gave, I think it was yesterday and he blamed white male culture for violence, right? And violence against women, which when I heard that I was like my goodness, I mean, he almost sounds like sort of like a black nationalist, like talking about, you know, sort of like, you know, the white man. And so you wonder if that is going to be a good idea for him to use those words, right? But again, this is him trying to figure out how to sound like a woke white man, right? And I think it's proving very difficult for him. And we'll see where that goes. We'll see if he runs for the White House, but you can see him sort of signaling that this is important, this diversity that's in the Democratic Party, name dropping, Stacey Abrams, this idea that maybe there would be a ticket with Stacey Abrams. So yeah, I mean, this is going to be a fascinating race. I think it's going to be, it's obviously a diverse field and we talk about that when we talk about Kamu here as you talk about Cory Booker, but it's also going to be a field that could be half white men, right? If they're 14 candidates, it could literally be 14 white men, two of whom are named John, John Hickenlooper and John Delaney. So that is what the field could look like. And so when you hear all the, you know, kind of buzzwords about electability in many ways that's talking about whiteness, it's talking about maleness, and a lot of the metrics we're going to be talking about in terms of who's a front runner and who's strong are again about race, right? If you think about why Biden is on top, it's about name recognition. If you think about the ways in which better or work for instance is leading and fundraising, $6.1 million or something, typically African Americans don't necessarily donate to political campaigns. Obama only 8% of the money that he raised came from African Americans. So if you're Kamu Harris, you raise like $1.5 million. And so by that metric of money raising, she might not look like the strongest candidate. So all of these ways in which we think very obvious ways we talk about race and then in not so obvious ways. So, you know, buckle up. Well, so in many ways, there are a lot of things that are on the table, you know, in this race. Some part of it is a battle for, you know, the discursive high ground. So when, when I very much appreciate you're introducing the white identity dimension of it, because for the most part, identity politics gets attached to Kamu Harris, to Stacey. It doesn't get attached to Biden, right? Even while the conversation is explicitly, how are we going to get the white working class back? So I'm like, watch TV and I was like, do you not realize when you say that, you are engaging in identity politics? It may be white identity politics, but it's still identity politics. So how can they continuously frame it in a obviously identitarian way? But yet at the same time, make it seem like our choices and our candidates are not. So I'm wondering about this. My colleague, Harris has a phrase word. He says that so much of the debate nowadays is about diminished overrepresentation of white men, diminished overrepresentation. It's still overrepresentate. It's still, but that little diminishment is a constitutional crisis for people. So it seems like a lot of this is playing out in what you're describing. The flip side is there does seem to be something about the fact that black women are, I sometimes call it the wheels of the bus. So is that an exaggeration to say that black women's political mobilization is a driving force in democratic possibilities, not necessary power, but possibilities. So if you look at the participation rate of African-American women, say over the last 30 years, starting in 1984 or so, it's about 60%, meaning the percentage of black women who are eligible to vote actually voting. And they're sort of in the middle of the pack in terms of the white men are higher and white women are higher in terms of participation rate. You fast forward to 2008 and black women in that election set a record for voter participation. It's like 68% in 2008. It's 70% in 2012. So you can see a lot of times you talk about Obama's victory and there's this idea of the surge of African-American voters, like 2 million extra African-American voters and a lot of that was powered by African-American women because the black vote is powered by African-American women. They're about 60% or so of the overall black vote and black men about 40%, 45%. So yes, and you see this showing up in other races. You see it showing up for instance in the Doug Jones race in Alabama. You see it showing up in the Terry McAuliffe race. Do you see it showing also in the Northumb race, the governor, the black face governor? I think you remember him. But yeah, black women supported him and even supported him after the black face incident. So yes, you do see that power. And then even if you think about 2012, you think about 2008 and you think about 2016, the sole way that Hillary Clinton is able to get the nomination is because black women in Georgia vote for her in record numbers, black women in South Carolina vote for her in record numbers. I mean, all of those southern states, she just cleans up by connecting with African-American voters, primarily African-American women, who dominate the Democratic Party in the South. They just run everything in terms of democratic politics in the South. So you fastward again to 2020, what does this look like for all of these candidates in terms of trying to appeal to African-American voters, primarily African-American women voters? What does that look like for Canada, like Kamal Harris, again giving a nod to Shirley Chisholm giving a nod to the A.K.A. She's a member of that sorority, having part of her announcement at Howard University. So you can tell, I mean, she obviously would be strong among that group. Somebody like Biden thinks he would be too. We'll see if he is. But I think one of the other things you hear from black women is this real desire to fight. It's down in Alabama with Hillary Clinton and a couple other candidates and just a woman came up to me and she was just like, I'm not angry. But I do want to fight, but I want to fight to win. I mean, there is a real sense of urgency among the black women I talk to. And I think you're going to see that show up. What does that mean in terms of how the candidates can connect with them? What sort of issues they bring up? Criminal justice reform. You've got Kamal talking about teachers, giving teachers a raise. Obviously a lot of African-American women in the South are teachers and then white women across the country as well. But yeah, so there is this power in terms of black women at the voting booth, but you don't necessarily, I think you can probably talk about it, as you don't necessarily see it in terms of representation, right? Never before a black woman governor, Stacey Abrams came close, ran this amazing campaign in Georgia obviously, only one black woman. I think ever been elected center, Kamal Harris being one of them, Carol Mosley being the other one. So there is this idea, I think, that still black women aren't necessarily electable, right? Because even people talk about Kamal Harris, you never necessarily hear the word electability attached to her in terms of being president. She's typically talked about as somebody who can run in tandem as a VP, right? With Biden. But not in her own right? Right in the right. And you know, some part of that electability issue has to do with the voting behavior of white women. I'm really taken by the overwhelming support that black women gave Hillary Clinton. Right. And the opposite with respect to Stacey, I think it was like 77% of white women voted for her opponent. So if we were even able to approach the, like a very small percentage of white women voting patterns that was clearly what was the formula that put Hillary in contention? If we were to able to move beyond, I use this term asymmetric solidarity. Right. So black women are therefore a whole lot of people that ain't there for them. We're there, we're there for our brothers. And I'm about to come to you because I'm thinking about so yes, there is this political power. But it doesn't necessarily translate to seeing the number of black women elected that we would think that level of power in the voting booth would translate to. So what is it that we are not seeing or understanding in terms of the barriers, the obstacles, the conditions in which black women move from being politically active to actually being candidates to actually becoming elected? There are so many barriers we don't even have enough time this evening. You know, I was thinking on the way over here, I just came back from Sacramento. We had a number of tough votes in a public safety. I said on public safety committee and you know, there are hard conversations that you're having because we use these strange definitions about who's suffering from mental health illness and who's a criminal and you know who should be fine and given assessments and penalties and when should we revoke these, you know, and who really deserves restorative justice and who really should be locked up. And I was thinking all day, Tuesday and today, you know, that when we're talking about race and gender, you know, that your privilege does not trump my existence, right? And you have to say that in these spaces. We are in the most progressive state some would argue, you know, in the nation, California. We have 40 million people living here. We have four African-American women in the Senate and in the Assembly combined. We have one black female senator and we have three African-American Assembly women and none of us represent a majority African-American or a majority of color district. And so all of us were elected because of white voters, male and female who for one reason or another probably decided to look toward values over, you know, racial representation and are giving us a pass. We could, I could not go out and drum up enough black women voters to keep me in this seat if I tried because we are just not here. We also have to have real conversations about the fact that as we look at the map of all of the districts, the 120 districts that make up this state of California, if we are looking to run black women, they too will be running in non-majority black districts. Then you have to have a whole conversation about electability about who is viable. Can you raise money? How much does it take? I ran in a special election. It was a million dollar race. Now I asked a lot of folks that looked like me to give me some money that certainly was not on the leader board in terms of givers, right? My folks. So who can raise the money? Who can actually get the machine behind you? I'm a Democrat. Most folks who are black, all of the folks actually who are black who are in the legislature are Democrats. You have to go through another machine, the Democratic Party. Well, let me tell you a little bit about that. Less than 3% of the delegates that make up the California Democratic Party are African American women. 150. There are 150 black female delegates representing this state. We actually run chairs to be the party chair of the Democratic Party in all states. We have a race going on right now. We have a black sister running to be chair of the Democratic Party. There is no way in God's green earth that those 150 votes will be the only votes that she will need to win, right? And so this sister has got to build a coalition and reach out to get other allies to help her succeed if she will be successful, right? So A, that means if the California Democratic Party wants to say, I want to have a black female agenda. Where are black women on this platform? Who's going to vote for that? You know, out of thousands of delegates, right? We all won't be able to lead that charge to the front, right? Then you, so I have to say, as a result of that, because the sister ran before and there were some things that went down and she was not successful. As a result of that, I actually co-founded the Black Women's Democratic Club because I said, well, I'll be damned if we have to go through this again or if any candidate comes before the party to get the nomination and to run and to not have more black women at the seat of the table. But it also means that we have to code switch because we have to figure out how to both represent ourselves and then represent everyone else in a way that is appealing, right? And tasteful to folks who may not be accustomed to hearing about black issues. And I want to go a little deeper into this issue because I recall after the re-election of Barack Obama, there was a whole conversation that really, it began in the first campaign, but then really took off that there was a new generation of black elected officials. These are elected officials who are not black politicians, but politicians who happen to be black. It was sort of intermingled with this idea of post-racialism, which basically means that we are beyond race, which tended to be translated into, don't ask me to talk about anything black. Don't ask me to put on the agenda anything that might identify me as black. Don't ask me to carry the water for anything that might sour my reputation among the white voters that I need. So what I'm interested in is A, how you have navigated that post-racial expectation. And B, do you think that it is possibly the case that black women, because they already are navigating stuff, they are black, they are women, they are many things, they don't get caught up in this idea that the only way I can be a black elected official is to deny every part of my constituents who are black and parts of myself. You know, so I don't think I have time to be anything other than who I am, you know, and I am emancipated black woman. And so I let everyone know when I was walking around knocking on doors that that was who I was and who I continued to be. I have to believe that voters are interested in authentic candidates that speak to them. And if you are letting folks know who you really are and then are stepping into the issues that are important to you, then you know, that's sort of, you know, that's the sweet spot in terms of connecting with folks. And you know, I will always talk about affordability issues and income inequality. I will always talk about criminal justice reform. I will always talk about the need to renovate our public education system. I will always talk about ways that we can have pathways into the middle class. I will tell you, after the failed 2016 national election, the DNC called an emergency meeting of 50 or so black female elected and stakeholders in the party and said, we need some help because we thought we were going to win in all of these races and we didn't. And so we all flew to DC in the summer, very humid. Hair was, you know, wide to have a conversation. And we said, you know, what was your agenda? What was the plan? How did you use black women? How were we involved? And folks, many of these sisters were from the South. They said, you know, because we were never engaged. We were putting our own pennies together to figure out how to get these folks elected. And, you know, where was the DNC? And the DNC said, we don't have any money and we don't have a plan. We do not have a black sister's plan. And I was thankful that folks were honest, but it was really sobering. And we were coming up on the race with Stacey Abrams and a couple of others. And you know, we said, then just give this to us and give us a little bit of something and then we will figure it out. And then we will come back to you in some months and you better have a plan. But I have to tell you for many of us who associate ourselves with the Democratic Party, it was, it was disheartening to hear that this infrastructure had forgotten us and was yet dependent on us to keep it going. And at least was honest enough to say, we're actually not that still, we're still not that interested in you all black sisters because we're still trying to get the disaffected white male vote. And we said, well, that vote is probably gone for eight years. So can you just come back to us? But sometimes you have to have those very real conversations, you know, and we were there for a few hours trying to remind them that these were the sisters who've shown up and who are going to continue to show up to find candidates to help them raise money and to get them across the finish line. But that can be disheartening. It's a little bit like that saying they don't want to dance with the people that bring them to the party. Right. So stepping for a moment outside of the immediate electoral arena to the broader political discourse, I want to go to you, Alicia. So we're in a moment where there are many different political waves that have happened. And of course you are at the center of one of them Black Lives Matter. And I think it's fair to say that the leadership of that moment and that movement looks a little different than the leadership of anti-racist movements in the past. The acknowledged leadership, let me say that. At the same time, it seems like that difference made the difference. Number one, and is also subject to backlash politics. So it's easy for us really to talk about politics in the big Democratic Party and white voters who are still not ready to vote for Black people. And that's a constant. But there are also internal politics that are playing out. So I'm wondering how you can take us through mapping of some of the internal backlash politics and what that might pretend for 2020. Well, shall the church say? You know, well, it's ready for it. So here's the thing. I mean, I always like to say that we're looking for Martin Luther King when we also need to be looking for Fanny Lou Hamer. And part of the intervention, I think Black Lives Matter was able to make was to use police violence and very visible instances of police violence and state sanctioned violence to also give contour to who was experiencing violence, to give contour to why. And because of your work, Kim, I think we were also able to say the face of violence in this country, meaning people who are experiencing state sanctioned violence are not just heterosexual Black men. And when we did that, I think what we also created room for was actually the growth of a movement because so many people from Black communities who have been kept out of mainstream Black politics said, oh, there's a place for me finally. And when we were able to do that, we were able to have different conversations about what's happening in our communities. We're able to have different conversations about issues, right? So we don't have to keep saying things like how do Black people get to the middle class? Because we can talk about, well, can LGBT Black people ever get there, right? Can poor Black women ever get there? Can Black immigrants get there? Like we could actually have a different kind of conversation about who is Black and what are Black people experiencing? I think the reality, though, is that to be honest, there is a huge backlash to that. And it's come in several forms. I will say to be 100% honest that the biggest supporters of Black Lives Matter are Black women. And a lot of that has to do with the lived experience of being pushed to the side and having your work completely invisibleized. So it was Black women who said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, check this out. We are going to make sure that you're all good. We're going to make sure that this story gets told correctly. And we're also going to make sure because when we actually decided that we would come out and say that we started this thing, it was because Black male dominated institutions were trying to claim it for themselves. We were fine to be anonymous until other folk were like, well, this is our thing and then started to water down what it was that we were talking about. So there is a backlash. There's a backlash on the level of why are these Black women? Trying to change the way that we've always done things. So there's one. There's backlash on the very basic level of, um, who are these Black women who have tattoos and who are queer and who are immigrant and who are all of these different things? Who do you think you are? Literally. And then there's a backlash that is the one that we all know, right? The all lives matter, the blue lives matter. There's all of that, which I call willful ignorance. Right? That's like saying water is wet. The sky is blue, right? We know all lives matter. Um, and they should matter, but they don't. And so this is, this is the conversation we're trying to have. And I was saying to a friend earlier today who asked me if I was surprised that people are so shocked by Black Lives Matter. I said, I'm not surprised by it. I actually think it's the lowest common denominator that we can be talking about. Like if you actually believe all lives matter, then Black Lives Matter should not even be an issue for you. Right? Right. But then at the, there's a fundamental level that I don't think we talk about a lot, which is the backlash that is coming that is related to both Black Lives Matter and then intersecting with the Me Too movement. And this is a backlash that essentially says that Black men are getting beat up on and that Black men, there's not enough attention being paid to Black men. And there's an alignment that's happening, right? That I'm incredibly concerned about. Now, I don't know if people, I don't know how much I want to go into this, but I'm just going to say it and we'll see what happens. There's a conversation right now that's happening about reparations. It's exciting. I like conversations about reparations. I think we should have more of them. They should be placed in a historical context. We should not act like the conversation about reparations is new. It is a long, not only conversation, but body of work. Yes. And it has never been intended to be exclusive to certain Black people. And there's a conversation that's happening under the guise of reparations that is essentially saying reparations should be limited only to American descendants of slaves. And the reason for that is because Black women, Black queer people, Black immigrants, and every other person in community of color is hijacking the potential that Black people can reach in terms of of redress for wrongs that have been committed. And why I'm concerned about that is because it mirrors very closely. A lot of us kept talking about Kanye being on one. What Kanye was talking about and how Kanye was being used was for a very similar agenda. The conversation around Black people exiting from the Democratic Party because of dissatisfaction around not being invested in, not being resource, not being engaged got hijacked to then say, well, Black people should leave the Democratic Party in favor of the Republican Party, which cares more about you. And when we saw those sit downs between Donald Trump and Kanye West, what were the conversations? The conversations were about Black fatherhood, Black malehood, Black business, right? It's gendered and it's racialized and it's classed and it's sexual identity-ized in a way that I think we should be concerned about. And the reason for that is it aims to roll back the openings that we have started to break open not just with white America and understanding who Black people are, but inside of Black America and embracing the complexity of who Black people are. If that strategy is successful and if the coalition that is Black people because we don't all think the same, agree on everything and I think if anybody's good at coalition politics is Black people. Right? But if that strategy is successful, I actually do think there are implications for 2020 because the reason that the Democratic Party has not invested in Black people is because they assume that Black people are always going to go along and get along. We don't have to worry about bringing Black people along with the Democratic Party agenda because we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, which you the whole time. But if a margin of that support erodes, that actually creates chaos for Democratic Party politics and I don't think we've talked about that in a way that is nuanced enough or serious enough to be honest. So there, there are two things about what, what you're saying that's so jump out at me. One is the fact that the male focus pro patriarchy, this is what they need. I want to throw Jim Brown in that conversation because he was part of it as well. But, but we do have to acknowledge that that's not just happened on the Republican side of the line. Let's let's remember that actually the point of departure for this conversation was the fact that my brothers keeper was lifting up this particular kind of narrative about what it, what ails Black people. What ails Black people is our gender disrepair. You know, what we need is traditional, two family, heteronormative families. And until we get that going, we can't expect any other kind of program or intervention. And this is exactly at the same time that working women are being talked about in positive ways when it's not talked about in a black context. When, when even sexuality engendered all of these issues are being embraced by, you know, the party. When it comes to Black folks, we're back in Aussie and Harriet land. So it is interesting that it's like a loaded gun on the table that can be picked up by the Republicans as well as the Democrats. So this is sort of like always sitting there, you know, sort of, sort of messing us up. So, so I'm hearing that and I'm also hearing the lack of investment, right? So you go to Washington DC and find out they don't have any plans to keep us mobilized. They think that it's just going to work out that way. And so here, Black women are kind of a bit twist in between, you know, asking for it to be made. And so what it reminds me of is actually when you were trying to get to the White House to talk about something very important. And that is the fact that the aftermath of the first election created a huge wave of voter repression. Right? It was happening across the country and it was racial. But the post-racial party, the post-racial president, didn't want to hear it. So talk a little bit about you were talking about coalition, how you had to use collisional politics, basically to get in front of the attorney general so that the reelection campaign was even possible. Right. And it's such a problem because, you know, I, you know, I, me and my big mouth, right? I guess you could say, you know, because I had the nerve to say that President Obama should have nominated a Black woman to the Supreme Court. You know, and that made me personal and regret in the White House because I said I wasn't supporting a Lena Kagan, not because he, if a Black president is going to point a Black woman to the court, who is? And so I was raising all kind of sand and they said, okay, we got you. And that means you're banned from the White House. So, let me just underscore this. At the time, you are leading one of the major civil rights organizations in the country. So one of the law are for 25 years. The lawyers committee on civil rights under law was being led by Barbara Arnwine. During much of this time, particularly this time, you're also leading the fight against vote repression. Yes. But you are banned for no way. Well, and so you know, it's the same. Ultimate contradictions, right? So, what happens is that while I'm banned, you know, the 2010 election, midterm elections happen, our folks don't show up, don't show out, don't do anything because we're happy! We got a Black president. We guys, does, does cruising with joy. And the polls, you know, racial narrative is just rolling. And so that's, you know, so it's a real bizarre time. But I'm sitting in my office and my staff starts, I mean, like January the 5th starts bringing me letters, the sign about all these ugly restrictive voting laws that were popping up as emergency must pass immediately, immediately, legislation in the states. And so the first letter I sign, and I said, oh, that's some ugly stuff. Voter, I, strict voter, voter ID, they're killing early voting. They just eliminated, you know, election day registration. What the hell? And so then the next one comes, and I sign and I said, wait a minute. It's the ugly strict voter ID eliminating, I said, wait a minute. By the third letter, I said, wait, wait, wait, these letters are all looking the same to me. What's going on? You know, did I just sign this? And they said, no, that was for the other state. I said, well, did I sign another one that was for the other state? I said, well, wait a minute. What's going on, people? They said, well, we think there's this thing called the American Legislative Exchange Council, Alex, that is behind this model of voter repressive legislation. And by the fifth letter, I said, this is horrid. We have to be mobilized. What's wrong with our community? Why aren't we calling this out? Why is all of the state by state? Why isn't there a national outcry about this? And folks were telling me, so I called a couple folks and tried to go around and talk with them by little notes and charts and showing people stuff. And they were like, they were like, Barbara, this is not the moment for this. In fact, people in the Democratic leadership sent a notice to me by one of my staff persons to tell me to hush up, to just shut my mouth. And why? Because they didn't want to hear it. Because they didn't want to play and quote the race card. And so it was really ugly. And so Mike, so you know how you commiserate? I don't know how you guys do. But I want to go sit down at the table in the middle of the house and start fussing. I'm just fussing out loud. So Mike said, heard me, my 25 year old son at that time, heard me fussing. And he came and he said, Mom, what is wrong? And I said, Oh, Justin, you won't believe it. So I tell him the whole story. And he said, so you're having a communications problem. I said, big time. And he said, so what? I said, so he says, Mom, he says, you know what? You need a map. I said, a map. He says, yes. He says, you need a really easy visual aid that people can immediately see it. I said, really? And he said, yes. And we could make an interactive. We could put it online. He can have his own hashtag. His own, his own, you know, handle. It could be on Instagram. I said, really? And he said, he said, yes, Mom. And I said, well, I'll be doing so I want to work the next day. And I looked at my staff and I said, I need a map. And we created what became known as the map of shame. So the map of shame leads to all kinds of reparations. I mean, people are going like, what the hell? Because I'm running around with my big old map, you know, going around from place to place to mass bigger than I am. It's at least five, six feet tall. And showing people what's going on and educating folks, 150 speeches in 2012, 100 speeches in 2011. But in 2011, all the civil rights groups are beginning to respond because Jesse Jackson picks it up and starts and helps we put on some press conferences and start rolling with this thing. The media is acting stupid. They're like, oh, this is just a bit conspiracy theory. We're not going to waste our ink on this. And all this other stuff. So the bottom line is that we start organizing and the language groups find out that I have been trying to get to the attorney general. I have called this office and just a usual run and round. And you know, nothing's worse than a governmental run around. And because they pass you the every door and body. And then they pass you back. And you know, it's all this ugly stuff. So I'm getting the stone, stone run around. So the good news is that the language groups, the Asian groups and the Latino groups had a meeting schedule with the attorney general to talk about section two, three, the language accommodation provisions of the voting rights act. And they called me up. And they said Barbara, we hear that you're having trouble getting in. I said, yeah, you heard right. And then they said, well, what about, they said, we're got a 45 minute meeting. We're going to we're going to take that meeting. We're going to put you on as one of our attendees. And you bring your map, bring your little map now, not the big map, because they're not going to let you in there. And you're bringing the little maps. And we want you, we're going to only take up 25 minutes of our 45 minutes. We're going to give you 20. And sure enough, we all got into the room and came after they ran through the 25 minute agenda. And everybody's going like, you're finished. They said, oh, no. Oh, no. Uh, Barbara's got something to say. And so I whipped out the map. And I'm really serious. That's how you roll, right? I whipped out the map. I laid it on the table in front of attorney general holder. And I said attorney general holder. This is the map of shame. This is what's going down in this country right now. Voter suppression. Look at these lawsuits. Look at these states that have all these horrible laws that they've been passing. Justice Department's been nowhere in this fight. I said attorney general, this is happening on your watch. Your watch. He looked at me. And by the way, the minute I started speaking, the heads of his head started going lower and lower. And by the time I ripped out the map and they just put their heads on the table. I'm really serious. I had never seen anything like it in my lifetime. And because he banged the table with his fists and he said, this is bullshit. He said, how has this happened? Everybody's. So in other words, he then, because Eric is just brilliant, he then started saying, listen, he says, I got this. I'll take care of my litigation people. He said, I got this and I got my policy people. He said, but what I'm hearing, Barbara, is that there needs to be a public education campaign. And he says, let's talk about how we do that. John Paden was still alive at the time. He's had an LDF and Wade Henderson and others. And so we had a great talk and that ended up with him giving the speech in that October, I believe. He gives a speech at the Lincoln, I mean, at the LBJ library in Texas, in Austin, Texas. It becomes a big naturally publicized speech. Justice starts intervening on all kinds of cases. And in the movement picks up. Now I'm still banned. Let me be clear. Ain't nobody invited me to any White House meetings. I'm not welcome. I'm still unwelcome because you know, they don't want me to say what I say. And people are getting so mad and frustrated that they literally are saying to them when they call them, the come to the meetings, I ain't coming. They say it's Barbara invited and they'll say, no, they sound not coming. All they'll go to the meeting and they'll say, I don't know why we're meeting because we need Barbara here because she knows more about all this stuff that we all do combine. And so finally, finally after the 2012 election, I am unbanned. That's it. That's the story. And then I came and got you in some more trouble. But we got to go there. But you know, one of the links that I want us to think about. So part of what the attorney general could do at the time was to bar some of these changes from going into effect because the Voting Rights Act was still on the table. And so that actually saved a lot of these elections. And now we see what happened without the Voting Rights Act. There's a whole lot to talk about. That fifth vote, Clarence Thomas, that contributed to the Voting Rights Act being taken from us and our contribution to putting him there. But that's a conversation for another day. What I'm going with the lying. Right. And without believing, I need a hymn. Just going to say, if we believed in need of hill, then Clarence Thomas wouldn't have been on the spring court. And we might still have the Voting Rights Act. And we might not have Trump in the White House. Right. However, there is the question about how this vote suppression actually played out in the midterms, particularly in what happened in Georgia. I want to tell you all that I've been teaching Voting Rights with Barbara at UCLA. And you know, she insisted that we teach a case that I hadn't been teaching. And it's all about how data was used to identify the voting practices of Black people and the voting practices of white people, eliminating all those things that Black people did, like early voting, right, and all souls to the polls. And retaining those things that white voters did. And they were explicit about asking about this information. So it wasn't like, oh gee, I wonder why this happened this way. They told us why they were doing it. And this is something that was, you know, finally struck down, but this is the level of vote repression. So there's that on that side. And then there's what we were talking about earlier, this 77% white woman thing. So, so, Nia, I want to come back to you and just get a sense of the difference between the strategies that are being talked about. So we might think about one strategy being the go all the way blue strategy, right, dig deep, activate voters who haven't been activated, really, really, you know, strike hard on some of the issues. And hope to just peel off four, five, six percent, although I mean, we don't need all of them. We just need four, five percent. So that's kind of the blue strategy. But then what seems to be talked about now is the goal purple strategy. So let's try to move the entire political discourse in the Democratic Party more to purple and perhaps borderline red to try to capture those Trump voters, particularly those Trump women. So is this an accurate sort of depiction of about the debate? Yeah, I think that's right. Those two strategies sort of deep blue or purple, you might even another way to look at it. It's sort of the rust belt versus the Sun Belt. The Sun Belt strategy being could a Democratic candidate for President win a state like Arizona. Could you win North Carolina as a Democrat in the way that Obama did in 2008? Of course, he lost it in 2012. Is Georgia ready to come online as a Democratic state that a Democrat can win in 2020? And the other part of that is, and I don't even know if the idea for the purple strategy is so much about white women as it is about the idea of white working class voters, particularly in the rust belt, particularly sort of disaffected white men who don't have those same factory jobs. So the idea, somebody like Biden can go, you know, Scranton, guy from Scranton, Gryping Scranton can go into those factories and into the rust belt and talk to those voters, Beto or work for instance, saying he's going to go everywhere, right? He's going to go to the rural parts of Iowa. He's going to go to Des Moines. He's going to go everywhere and talk to every voter. Obviously didn't work well for him in Texas. He didn't really get a lot of those voters. He was able to swell the voters in urban areas as did most Democrats who ran, like Stacey Abrams, like Gillum as well in Florida. But yeah, I mean, those are the sort of two strategies. And I think you'll see the candidates figure out what is the most viable strategy for them. Kamal Harris, probably more of a sunbelt candidate. And then somebody like Biden would be the rust belt candidate. And I think it's sort of the ultimate idea for a lot of voters you talk to and a lot of Democrats you talk to is that the ultimate outcome would be a purple ticket because Biden would be at the top and Kamal Harris or some other woman would be at the bottom of that ticket. So, you know, we'll see what happens. I think if you think about what did happen in 2016, basically 80,000 votes, right? In three states. So the idea that it was sort of a cataclysmic then in terms of the way people voted, not really, right? I mean, you think I had Obama, Obama won Pennsylvania by like 600,000 votes. I mean, just sort of a massive reshaping of the map in a way that Trump didn't really do. So the question is, do you go for the people who stayed home? There was a drop off, obviously, an African American voters, a drop off in young voters as well, the sort of Obama coalition. Do you go after those voters or do you hope and pray that the voters who voted for Obama in 2012 and then voted for Trump in 2016? Do you think you can go get those voters? The thing about those voters, though, is that there were Republican voters in many ways. They had a Republican voting history and then they flipped to Obama and then they flipped back to Trump. So this idea that somehow, you know, if you're Joe Biden or if you're better or work, I mean, maybe you can get those voters. I mean, it is proven that Obama was able to activate a part of the Democratic party that hadn't been activated and you wonder if that might be the easiest strategy. A couple of Harrisville tested, Bidinal Test, a different sort of situation. The question was, did they stay mobilized? Did they continue to mobilize them? There is a narrative that once they got activated, it's like, thank you very much. Yeah, you know, we're moving on. I'm going to go to questions in a moment. So raise your hands so we can get ready by I want to do two quick hits. Data. So you've got something going now called Black Futures Lab and help us think about how data can be used to enhance Black well being through politics, through other means because we've basically been seeing data kind of being used against us. So what are you trying to do with data and what are some of the lessons that might come out of it? Well, we're trying to turn data on a Ted in a way. So we got tired after the 2016 election of people talking about Black folks but not talking to us. And the result of that, again, is that when people are seeking our votes, they're talking about things in such a way that the control is the experience of those white working class, mythical voters that aren't coming out to do the thing that Black folks have been doing for a minute. And so we started a project called the Black Census Project, which is the largest survey of Black people done since reconstruction. And what we're, what we did is we asked Black people all over the country, what are you experiencing in the economy, in our democracy, in our society, and what do you want to see for your future? We collected 30,000 more than 30,000 responses from liberals and conservatives, from LGBT folks and heterosexual folks, from rural and urban, from folks who are currently incarcerated and formerly incarcerated, folks who are US-born and born outside of the US, and will be releasing the responses next month. But the thing that's really interesting that you should know is that the number one piece of feedback that we got about this survey was that nobody has ever asked me these questions. And you'll be interested to know also that many of the people who took our survey, even though they are spread out across the country, these are not people who were all surveyed by the same people. We built partnerships with more than 30 grassroots Black-led organizations in 28 states across the country. Everybody administered their survey the same, but it wasn't the same people administering the survey. Not everybody got the same questions, right? Like we really tried to diversify so that we could actually say, this is what Black folks are saying across the country, and you would be surprised how similar it is even across the differences that we were intentional about. Every single person is saying not only is nobody asking me what I need or what I want, but the other piece that I think is kind of fascinating actually is that people are saying, I prefer an organization that speaks to my experiences and speaks from my experiences. So from that 30,000 people who responded, 11,000 people said I want to stay engaged, meaning we did not require people to give us their contact information to participate. So a third of those people said, I need to stay engaged. That's pretty large if you know data, right? Last thing I want to say about the survey and I think this piece is really important. What we started to understand very clearly from the responses is that it's not rocket science. What we did was take our community organizing hats and say how do we use this in service of our goals in 2020, which is to get rid of Trump and Trumpism, right? And to create more political space for us to transform democracy. How do we do that? We are not, you know, a big organization where you're old. We put $500,000 or more into the field, resource black organizations and we were able to touch a whole lot of folk. What if the democratic party did that? Yes. How would politics change in this country? We also have started to think about, well, how do we influence candidates to think differently about how you engage with our communities? Because frankly, it's not enough to keep saying things like tax cuts for the middle class or, you know, we support affordable healthcare. It's like when you talk to black women in the south, that's great. We support affordable healthcare too, but the attacks on healthcare are unique to black people in the south, right? Like there is a uniqueness to how healthcare is being attacked. And if you're not addressing that as a candidate, you are not getting black folks behind you. That's a problem. So I know there's a lot of people that love Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders talks about inequality. Bernie Sanders is like deep in the like, let's get rid of corporations out of politics, like he's deep in all that, right? You would think that be something black folks would be down for, given the way that corporations are decimating black communities. He doesn't have a huge black following. Why is that? Because he only will talk about class. He won't talk about the relationship between race and class. He's just not good at it. It's something maybe he's trying to do, but that has an impact on politics. And when people are mad about what happened in the primary in 2016, people say, well, Hillary stole it. Or, you know, Bernie was the person. It's like, cool. That can be true. What can also be true is black folks were not lining up at the door, pulling the lever for Bernie Sanders. And we have to ask ourselves why. And any successful campaign in 2020 is also going to ask itself, why aren't black folks lining up behind me? And what can I do? That's why you have Joe Biden dangling this carrot saying, well, if I make Stacy my vice president, and they're testing really, can we get black folks support? So it's something for us to pay attention to. I'm dying to ask a question, but let me collect yours. And then I'll attach mine to what y'all ask. How about that? So let me see some questions. There are some right here. You all talked a lot about, like a lot of the like, like a series of who's been doing this work, and he's been doing it in ways that are comprehensive and like the world in terms of like talking about like black blackness, gender, all these types of things. And he was wondering if you can kind of speak to the way that like particularly something like the Columbia Heaver collective in the name itself, but also in the politics that it espoused the way that it kind of not only like talked about how we could move forward within the system, but also kind of separated from it, particularly in the way that it's grounded itself in socialism. And what that can look like for us to really see, like all of these candidates who are trying to get black voters, but that like the democratic party, but also the Republican party and the entire system as a whole isn't really checking for black people, but particularly black women. Great, thanks. Another question? Right here. Good evening. Good evening. Am I on? Okay. I've often wondered when you speak of getting votes and being successful, is there a certain age group you go after? Is there a certain geographic area? Educational background? I've always wondered because I've been a voter ever since I had the opportunity to vote and was very proud to do so. So for one to feel that they are successful, who is it that you go after and what age group are you targeting to know that you're going to be successful? Okay. So I think that question goes to you. Let me throw some in. Y'all can sort of jump in if you want. We're in Hollywood. We had a conversation last year about casting and black women. I just want to just kind of wonder if there's a connection between the role of colorism and just what looks like the part of the president and what doesn't. So let's imagine we were casting a movie. Let's not we. Hollywood was casting a movie. And it's about the first black woman president. My hunch is that nobody, you know, darker than Regina King would even get called to come in. Right? We expect that to play out in Hollywood. We don't like it, but we know that's what goes down. We don't talk about that so much in politics. But yet there seems to be casting going on. I mean, when people talk about Stacy Abrams, does she look like a governor? To me, I'm thinking, okay, are we having a casting issue here? Is it playing a role? So I'm interested in what you all think about how the, you know, handicapping of her chances might be reflective of some of the same stuff happening on the other side of the country that happens here. I'm also interested in, and me, this might be for you, you report a lot about black voters and black politicians. Do you have a sense of what a black woman's political agenda might look like? Or what does politics look like if black women's, you know, priorities were not so marginalized. And I think that might also be something that goes to some of the things that you've introduced, even though you're not a majority black district, there are some things that you're introducing that wouldn't happen if you weren't there, right? And then finally, when we talk about backlash, we talk about internal backlash, but then there's external backlash. There's this black identity extremism stuff happening that, you know, the me, isn't this co-intelpros stuff all over again? Do people know this history? Where is that conversation? And where does it need to go at this particular point? So these can be thought of as summaries and, you know, final words to our wonderful audience. So can we start with? Sure. So we love voters like you. We love older voters who are well educated. You all tend to come out in special elections and all elections. And so when you're looking at getting as many votes as possible, you also, we have a ton of formulas and algorithms on schematics. And when you need to spread your money as far as possible, you go towards high-prepensity voters and they tend to be older educated voters. There is colorism. When I first ran for the Los Angeles Community College Board, it is an at-large seat as for the entire county of Los Angeles. I had conversations, very real conversations with my consultant about what slate mail I put my face on and what slate mail went out with just my name. Sydney Kamlager, you wouldn't know who that person was. And I was unhappy with that strategy. And because it was an at-large seat for the entire county, I used that strategy and was successful. So in black communities, I put my face on so they knew that I was legit. And in other communities, I didn't. And I just went with, you know, doing the things that you would normally do. And it's very real. And we have got to move the dial and have very uncomfortable conversations about why people still employ those strategies to get elected. Here, as I mentioned, we have four black women in the legislature. But we are very powerful. We are doing things that are helping everyone. You have a sister who is chair of Senate budget. You have a sister who is chair of budget sub five on public safety. You have a sister who has a select committee on incarcerated women. You have a sister who is bringing forth a bill on eliminating lethal force so that we are not having to deal with seeing our brothers and our sisters killed in the streets. Because of black women, you have legislation and budget items that talk about funding black babies for wellness. And looking into implicit bias in the medical community in our courts and our law enforcement. You have black women talking about maternal health, you know, and looking at that data to figure out how we can stop some of these deaths from happening in stillbirths in communities of color. When we have to have hard conversations on the floors, black women are the ones who are tapped to say, can you exercise your voice of the moral compass of this house so that we can move the agenda forward? Now, these might be issues we have. You have a legislation running through that talks about the protection of natural hair to protect braids and locks. Yes. Now, these are all laws. These are all pieces of legislation that are being carried and championed by the sisters that are in the legislation that are in the legislature in the body. Now, we're also talking about a whole host of other things. But we also know that by fighting and getting these things passed, it will actually be helping everyone. But we are just using the lens from which we come to sort of elevate these conversations that have been marginalized and invisibleized or are only being talked about in homes of black homes. And if you're not there, it's not on the take. All right. Barbara. Yes. On the issue of the age group, what are the age groups that I really, really, really work hard with is the youngest voters because we forget that younger voters, if you do a, if you take a diagram and you mapped out the views, policy considerations and desires of people over 60, and you went to the opposite spectrum and that the politics policies and desires of people between 18 and 30, they're like polar opposites. And a lot of what's wrong is that that younger category needs to be voting as aggressively as the 60 and older's to our whole party, politics changes because what they want has no relationship to what's sitting in the White House right now has no relationship to what is sitting in the Senate and controlling the Senate. Their policies are so radically different than what we consider here that we, I mean, and they're good on so many good issues. So I think that my commitment with my old butt has been the work with younger folks to really motivate as much voting as I can, as much registration, much advocacy. In fact, next week, I'll be on college campuses talking with young activists about how to get our vote on and how to keep moving this movement because that's what is really needed. It's a very ignored cadre. The other thing I just want to say is that, you know, the one of the stats that most people missed, and in fact, when I gave that step to the CBC, Reverend Jesse Jackson asked me to come and meet with him with the CBC, the Congressional Black Caucus, and I said they were talking about strategies and concerns for 2018 at that time, and I said, well, the biggest concern is, you know, in 2016, you had two million less Black ballots counted in the presidential election. It's the first decrease, and they voted ballots counted for blacks. Now, when I say counted, you notice I didn't say turnout, because a lot of black ballots get spoiled and get tossed out by a lot of this voter suppression nonsense. And so, you know, so, you know, we, and I talked about what that looks like and how it affected this election, not to mention something nobody wanted to talk about at that moment, which was the Russian interference. A whole lot of Black folks, you know, thought they were cool, because they were following folks on social media who were telling them, don't vote. You know, be cool, don't vote. Or were telling them, you know, you better not go to the polls, because you're going to be arrested, whatever. They were doing everything they could to suppress the Black vote, and lots of that was Russian-based. They had Black faces on those Twitter accounts, Black faces on those Facebook accounts, Black political organizational names, and all of those were run by Russians. Right now, Ados, I'm not going to get all into it, because I was going to tell you we got to have a war up in here. But, you know, but we know that this whole, you know, movement telling Black folks that they have no alignment with immigrants, Black immigrants. They have no alignment with blacks throughout the African diaspora, that we have nothing in common that we're only US bases ridiculous. W-A-B-Dibors would just, oh my god, you know, all the others, you know, who fought, think about it, Dorothy Hype, you know, mean, every Black leader in history who was watched something was internationalists, Fetty Little Haymer, all of them, you know, we got to understand that this movement right now, and guess what? We've done some studies on where some of these accounts coming from. I'm not talking about leadership, because I don't know much about the leadership. But a lot of those accounts that have been jumping on my case, because I talk about problems with, you know, killing people like Maryl and Brazil, and I talk about anti-Black racism worldwide, and I talk about other stuff, and they've been jumping on me. Oh, system, we need you to focus on the US, and we don't want you distracted, like I can't think, right? You know, multi-dimensions, you know, just ridiculous. So, you know, so it's really important that we be careful, because we track some of those accounts back to Russians. They're all Russian-controlled. Again, so they got a new strategy, that is to get up inside the reparations debate, mess with it when it's such a critical issue, destroy it, keep talking about Republican candidates who people ought to be supporting, and dividing our unity among the African diaspora. It's sick. It's very bad. And we need to be very smart, that one of the things that we got to do this time is that we can't get caught in that mess, and we got to be smarter than that. And do you want me to talk about Harriet now? I'll give you the last word on Harriet. Let me get the last two, and you take us home with Harriet. All right. So, the Black woman's agenda, I think is the question you have three. I think the sort of template for thinking about the Black woman's agenda and what it might look like, and what a candidate might look like who has a candidacy focused on the Black woman's agenda. It's Stacey Abrams. I mean, this race that she ran in Georgia, I, you know, continue to be impressed by what she did there. And the folks who she got out to vote in that race were voters she had registered, right? I mean, that has been central to her identity central to what she wanted to do in Georgia, and almost did in Georgia. We'll see if she runs either for Senator in 2020 or governor again, in a rematch with Brian Kemp. But if you looked at the way in which she ran, she very much centered our own story. She wasn't afraid to talk about her blackness. She wasn't afraid to talk about her natural hair. She wasn't afraid to talk about her unique experiences as a Black woman, and what that meant in terms of being in debt, right? And being, I mean, we all, you know, in Black families often it's the Black woman who has to multitask and is sort of the person who is the lynch pin financially and people are, you know, supporting other other family members. So she talked about that. She obviously talked about criminal justice for whom she talked about voting rights. She talked about public education and desing in public education, as well as expanding Medicaid. So I think that is a race. I mean, if SAC Abrams ends up transforming Georgia, either in, you know, in this next election in 2020 or if she runs again and wins, that has tremendous power in terms of what the country will look like in terms of these southern states where the majority of African Americans are in states like Alabama, states like South Carolina. So that's a race where she ran as an unapologetically Black woman in Georgia. And so I think that is a race to do and almost one. And almost one. No, I think that's right. Almost one. Yes, yes, go ahead, Alisa. Wait a minute. She won. But Brian Camp stole the, stole it. All right. Stole it. So, you know, balance disappearing voting machines with no plugs. I mean, people waiting in lines for three, four hours. I saw a whole thing. She won the, she won the race. She won the race. But why would go to the crime scene? It was a crime scene. We talked about from vote suppression to voter depressions. So, you know, how do we come, come back from that? So you go ahead to, talk just for a minute or two about the identity extremists. Give us, give us your thought about where we go with that. And then we'll have to wrap up. Well, Black identity extremists is a new designation for Black Lives Matter activists. And it is not the first time that the government has come up with terms that identify Black activists and organizers with terrorism or terrorists. But certainly, what we know historically about that strategy has been that it's been used against some of the most powerful Black radical organizations like the Black Panther Party. And it's been used to decimate and create chaos both within and between organizations by both creating suspicion about either who's working with the government, who's not working with the government, or it is also very much, I think, been used to create a climate of distrust of those movements themselves. And in a post-9-11 environment where terrorism is associated with religion and with extremism, it's not a surprise, right, that there would be an attempt to denigrate support for a movement that has pretty good support amongst Black folks. And even some interesting support amongst white communities and certainly a lot of support among communities of color throughout the country. So what do we need to know about this? What we need to know is that we are under an administration that prioritizes and has been explicit about saying they prioritize law and order. And law and order really means for some because, you know, we have an administration that's breaking laws every single day. And at the same time, we should be aware that the increase of activism that people are being engaged in and are engaging in themselves to protect the rights that we do have left and defend them is game for targeting by labels like this. So it's being banned from the White House, right? I'm also was banned under that administration. We'll talk about that another time. We'll talk about that another time. But it is also very much being targeted for what you're doing. And so many activists and organizers that I'm in relationship to from the women's march to the climate movement are being visited by the FBI. Are being questioned, are being surveilled? And that's not conspiracy theory. This is well documented, right? Color of Change, Rana campaign to try to release the FBI records, right, of their surveillance and monitoring of Black Lives Matter activists that there's been another kind of suit that's been filed to try to get them to release that information. So it's just important for us to understand that this work does not come without risk and the work that Black women are doing to change the political landscape is not without risk. And frankly, right, it's not lost on me, right? That in this play, we saw Harriet's heart be broken over and over and over again. And my goal and what I think about every single day is what kind of work do we need to be doing to mend those heart breaks? That's why we engage in politics, not because we care about Democrats or Republicans or whatever. It's like because we care about mending the heart breaks in our communities. Yeah, you'll see why I roll with these sisters right here. Please join me in thanking Alicia, Nia, Barbara, and the assemblywoman, Candle, who does. Let me also thank some folks. Thank you, Hammer, Claudia, and your great staff for making this possible. And I want to give a shout out to APF staff. You see them running literally around with APF T-shirts, Naima, Madeline, Julia, Jira, Michael, Eden, Lisa, and Kevin. Please join us tomorrow. We're taking up the question of say her name, the lives that should have been. We'll be joined by many of the mothers of women who have been killed by the police. Rhonda Dormias is right here in the front row. Many of you probably heard her on intersectionality matters. So they'll be with us tomorrow. So please stay with us. Barbara, you get the final word. Quick word on Harriet. Well, most people don't know that Harriet Tubman would go to the White House all the time, because she was very close with Abraham Lincoln's wife. And she would go visit her. But every time she went to the White House, she refused to visit and meet with Abraham Lincoln himself. I mean, she had, I mean, scourge of visits. I mean, she would go there sometimes three and two and three times a week. But she would never meet with him. Why? Because she said his policies were wrong for black people. She didn't like where he stood on, you know, post-emacipation. She had all kind of issues about equality. And she just what she refused, refused to meet with him. And Sergerna Truffa, of course, met with him. And there's a famous photo of the two of them. And she said that in some of her memoirs, when people interviewed her about this, about why wouldn't she meet with Lincoln, she said, well, Sergerna got on me for that. And I told her that I didn't want to be a photo op. This is way back. All right. So last, you know, when we are talking about using our political power, just think about how you stand on principle. And how that is so critical to any success. And black women, that's something we know how to do. Thank you.",

And as you think about what happens next in your life, because it is your turn, I hope that as you move into the next phase of your life and your success, that you consider three things that I'm going to tell you. The first is to be unapologetic about who you are. Thank you for that, Lika. The second is to go places where you are not expected to be. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And the third is to don't be the last. Yes. Yes. Yes. So I want to share with you a story of about three weeks ago, I was invited to go to this conference. It was a big, snooty conference, super expensive. It was put on by this very wealthy man who went to prison and then came out, decided to do good things. And so he had this conference and he had a salon that I was invited to. It was a private discussion that he was moderating with the board of supervisors. So I went and I listened. It was a room of about 30 people and not too many of us there. And so he was talking as much as he was asking Shins and Listening. And then at the end he said, you know, I'm going to open it up to questions and answers. So I had a question. I was thinking, oh, I'm going to ask this. You know, I raised my hand. I had a good question. I had a good question that kind of took into consideration everybody in the audience. And so he spoke, he had to go to questions. And he pointed to this man right in front of me who hadn't raised his hand. And he's still trying to train. What do you think about what we were talking about? Do you have any comments or questions about, and I didn't have a question. But that's a good point you raised. So I was like, well, maybe he didn't see my hand. Although I think it was the only one that I'm going to raise again. So I raised it again. And he pointed to somebody in the back of the room. And he said, so, so friend, so this is another friend of mine. Do you maybe have a question about what we've been talking about? Da da da da da da da da. You asked the question. And the guy said, well, you know, you raised a good point. You know, and he asked his question. So I'm looking at one of the board of supervisors, Supervisor Mark Ridley Thomas. And he's given the eye, and he's giving me the eye. And then he leans over to the moderator, and he's like, you know, the girl's got her hand up. So I raised my hand again. And he asked this light scam black sister sitting right in front of me, who also did not have her hand raised. So so and so, I know you're a friend of so and so. I don't know if you have a question, but what do you think about Da da da da da da. And so she commented. And so by then other people who didn't have questions came up with questions, and they raised their hand. And he asked all of them their questions until the very end when he came to me. So, you know, I had been stewing. I was so irritated. I was so irritated. I had been stewing. At the time he got to me, I said, you know, I'm not going to ask that question. Screw that question. I'm going to ask the question that I really want to ask. And so I did. And my question was about gentrification, because they were to the board of supervisors. And I said, well, you know, how are you all going to manage gentrification in our communities? Because you see these little businesses that pop up and then come in. Our communities turn into safari destinations, but then people leave and where are the amenities. And so the supervisors said, well, that's a really great question. And they answered it. And then this moderator said, well, you know, I want to respond to that too. And he said, you know, it's not a gentrification that the trouble. It's reverse gentrification too. That happens with things like busing, busing into schools. And you know, you have these busing situations where you're busing poor kids into rich neighborhoods. And you know, the poor kids, they rough up the rich kids, but that's okay. They need it and the rich kids teach the poor kids stuff, and that's okay. But then what happens is the rich folks like me, we get upset and we leave. And then what happens to the community, it goes down. And so, you know, the only way that these schools, you know, get good and stay good is when you have these activists, parents of these poor kids, who really want to commit to the schools. And so that's what I think. And so, you know, I sat there and I was listening to him and I went through those five stages of grief, you know, shock, denial, anger. But you know, you eventually you land on acceptance. And I was thinking to myself, I said, you know, I specifically asked a question that was not directed to this man. And he specifically re-insorted himself back into the equation. And you know, that was when I had my acceptance moment. I said, you know, this is a great lesson for us all. Because this was completely unapologized. He didn't care. He was completely owning his perspective and his life. And you have to be that way too. Thank you. You have to be unapologetic in who you are. You have to be unapologetic in where you come from. And you have to be unapologetic in what you're working with.",

Well, I just wanted to be here to see John Cox, the candidate for California Governor, and here what he has to say. How about the US representative that's running? I'm actually not in her district. I'm over the hill. Over in Loretta Sanchez's district. Yeah, I know. But yeah, anytime I can get a chance to support any of the Republican candidates, you know, I'm here. I originally voted for Travis Allen. At first, fortunately he went down. So, next one is for John Cox? You think he could help California? Oh, yes, he will. With everything that he did promise it will happen. I wanted to be a part of something, so I just wanted to come and show my support. I just wanted to be a part of something, and we need someone like John Cox in the Governor's seat. We need a businessman that's going to change everything, bring everything back into balance. I'm Jim Sknell. I'm from Fullerton, and I'm here to see John Cox's help us on the way bus. And John Cox, obviously. We are here to support John Cox, and what we would like to say? Well, yes, on Prop 6, John Cox is a big supporter, and he wants to help lower taxes and make California great again. Keep the economy great in California because the Democrats are bringing it down. Big companies are leaving. If you want to keep the big companies in California, you've got to bring the repubs in and keep them in. Look at the big companies up north, they're going into Reno. Yeah. My name is Brian Cah. What are you here for? I'm here to support John Cox. How do you think he's going to help out the state? Repeal gas tax, that's the first thing. Our tax rate is too expensive. I'm about to move out of this state, so we have to change something to get this state going again. Absolutely. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you. Have a great weekend. You too, my friend. Yeah! Come on! Go, go, way back! You're just going to get pushed up. That's right. Hold your shoulder. Hold your shoulder. Help us on the way. What the whole world? Jump out. Jump out. Jump out. Jump out. Jump out. We have a push gun. We have a push gun. Go. We're going to be very careful. Let's get started. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here today. On Tuesday, the voters of this state are going to make their voices heard. They want this state to be affordable. They want this state to be livable. And that's what's going to happen when I'm the governor of this state. We are going to elect John Cox's governor, and we're also going to send young Kim to the U.S. Congress. Thank you, John. And one of the first things that I'm going to do as the governor of this state is we are going to stop throwing money down the train of a train that is behind schedule and over budget. And we're going to take that money. And we're going to give it back to the people of this state. We're going to refund every registration fee paid under that gas pack. The people of this state have been taxed enough. They have been paying so much for housing, for gasoline, for food, for electricity that have been driven up by the special interest groups that control Gavin Newsom, that control the legislature. We say enough is enough. We want a state that's affordable, and we're going to get it when I'm the governor of this state. Thank you all for being here. Let's have young say something here too as well. Thank you all. All right. First, what we're going to do is on Tuesday, we're going to repeal the gas tax by voting yes on six. Yes on six. Yes on six. Yes on six. Yes on six. Yes on six. We need John Cox to be the next governor of state of California. Can you imagine Gavin Newsom being our governor? No. All right. Can you imagine Gil Cisneros being your representative? No. I don't think so. We're going to repeal the gas tax, elect Young Kim to the 39 congressional district. We're going to bring some common sense back into governing. We cannot continue to have dysfunction in Sacramento or in Washington, DC. Ladies and gentlemen, I served you in Sacramento. I've seen dysfunction personally. We cannot continue that round. Drink this one. Drink this one. Drink it up the hand. There's no high spirel that's going nowhere. There's no conductor there. If we stop wasteful project like high spirel, we have money, ladies and gentlemen, to fix our rows and finish that infrastructure needs. So ladies and gentlemen, let's get out there. 72 hours is really critical. It's all going to come down to few votes. It could be your vote. It could be your vote. So don't step, don't sit back and do nothing. If you have an absent to battle, ladies and gentlemen, turn that in today. It needs to be pushed by two states to be counted. Tell everyone your neighbors, your friends, your relatives, tell everybody to get out and vote. That is what is going to make a difference, right? Right, absolutely. This election is extremely important for the future of this state. This state has been made unforetable and unlivable. We've got a school system that is competing with Mississippi for the worst in the nation. We are going to have the number one school system when I'm the governor. We have got to make this state affordable for people. Housing, gasoline, food, it's way too expensive. We're going to change that. The first thing we're going to do is change our government on Tuesday and elect me as governor. And then we'll have a new day in California. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

God bless you. Thank you. We just were counting on you. We're going to move to the car after the rest of the race. We are. You know that we spent $500 million on three homes that house 700 intellectuals and physically disabled people. Really? That money could be spent on so many other services for the intellectuals and disabled people. But it's being used to run those three homes, which would probably have a bunch of bureaucrats and a bunch of other people, you know, being natural. We're just going to get that money out to be spent to some more famous ones. I don't know if you're interested. I appreciate it. Thank you. Now for the issue. Run California responsibly, adapt spiritually, use our resources responsibly. That's what we have to do. We're wasting tax waste. That's it. And now, do we have that good? Thank you. We got to get these key turns around. We got to get these key turns around. Seven of these. It's happy to get going. Thank you. I want to thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to do what's going on. I'm going to want to start. I'd like to hear my end. God bless you. Thank you for being here. All right. Let's have that train. Go ahead. Yes. But end that. We do. All right. Thank you. Thank you for all your good work in here. Make sure we have these folks. Thank you all for all this work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to need this thing. It's all broken. It is an investment here. We're going to bring a head bunch交 towards Washington's. You were at the aerospace industry.kiT at Colombia. Good to see you. It's good to see you. Thanks for being here. The business has been destiny in this state before. We have some him RS這個 thing and Rachel's going Yes. Sure, sure. Captain, what? All right, let's do the air service. What do you believe in you? Well, the support president wrote. Well, we need to get the vote out. You know, people have to know that there's a way to get changed. You know what I'm saying? Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In your entrance, can I have a stand-alone? Sure. You know, we've got to have jobs and opportunity for people. Yeah, he's doing an event with Chelsea Handler today. He's doing an event with a bunch of congressional candidates. He doesn't even mention your name when he's out on the stump. Do you think that he's sort of looking past this election? Well, listen, he made Washington the whole issue in this race. He wants the run for president. I want to fix California. We've got 40 million people here who are really struggling. And, you know, I know what it's like to struggle. And I care about what's happening to this state. People are, you know, spending 40, 50% of their incomes on housing. There's nothing left at the end of the month. When I'm the governor of this state, one of the first things I'm going to do is we're going to call a special session. And we're going to come up with a whole lot of ways to fix this housing crisis. We're going to try to streamline the regulations, shorten the approval process, do something about the taxes and impact fees that people are paying. All of these things are driving up the cost of housing. That drives up costs all over the place. I mean, food costs, gasoline, everything that just keeps making this state unaffordable. And it just can't keep going on like that. And last question, this is the end. People are deciding your closing argument, the last, most important thing you want people to know as they head in to make their decision. This is the status quo versus change. This state is so tough for people. There's so many people that are moving out or thinking about moving out because they can't afford to live here. That's the status quo. I represent change. I'm going to cut the regulations and make sure that people can build truly less costly housing. We're going to get our education system improved. It's now 47th in the nation. We're going to make sure that people have water. We've got water rationing coming in 2022. That is not going to happen on my watch. There's a lot of things that have been run badly by the people of this state. By the people who have been leading this state. We need to have the courage. Real courage is voting for something different. Voting for change. That's what I represent. And I think when the people really sit down and decide they're going to vote for change and not the status quo. We're going to have a quick shot of the two of us talking and we'll let you be on your way. Yeah, John! John, I got one question. Go on. I'll see you. I have to make a decision. Okay. Calmedability is Sacramento. Poundability. You've got it. Okay. Okay, so last push, last weekend. Yes. You want to tell voters who are on the side right now. You know, this is about change. I represent change. My opponent is the status quo. It's as simple as that. We've got the highest cost of living in the country, the highest poverty rate, the highest rate of homelessness. Which he did nothing about when he was the mayor of San Francisco. It's worse than ever. I represent attacking these problems and solving them. That's what I've been doing in the private sector for 40 years as a businessman. Getting results, delivering change. The people of this state cannot live here affordably anymore. Cost of housing is out of touch, out of sight for most people. The cost of gasoline is now $5 a gallon in areas of Los Angeles. The political class in Sacramento is responsible for driving up those costs. I think we need a check and balance on what our legislature has been doing. I represent that check and balance. I represent real change. We've got so many areas in this state that need change that I think the people will vote for that. Contrary to what the polls are saying right now, your campaign is saying people will be surprised from Tuesday. I think they will. I think they will. I mean, the polls are the polls. The only one that counts as they say is the one on election day. But I think people, there's an undercurrent. There's really an undercurrent of people who are really disappointed in the leadership of this state. How can you be defending a school system that's 47th in the country? How can you defend 150,000 or so homeless people on our streets that are making life difficult for themselves and for the rest of us as well? How can you defend housing prices that are triple, triple what they are in most parts of the nation? You can't defend that. And a lot of that is caused by the political class. And they have to be held accountable. I represent change. I'm going to work with people on solving these problems. But I'm going to push for the change that we need. Thank you very much. Thank you. We've got to go straight to the bus. Sir. I've got our question. So we're out of time. You have to go to the next one. How do you do with workers? Well, that's just what it's got to do. Here's the worker calls. It's the trial. It's the trial. The browns and the California is going to get used to the fires. Move him. Move him. Move him. Thank you. That's what I want to go through. Yeah. Just over here. There it goes. Yeah. One, two, one. Yeah. Two, three, two, and seven. There it goes. That's what I'm going to do. Oh my God. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Help us on the way. Help us on the way. Help us on the way. Help us on the way. Help us on the way. Help us on the way. John Coffitt Governor. John Coffitt Governor. John Coffitt Governor. John Coffitt Governor. Alright. Can you move forward? Come on. See this. We're heading up to Riverside Park. to Riverside County, in Norco, and Coroner area. We are gonna support Dola Salie, a candidate for the assembly. But really, and truly, what we're gonna do is bring our message. And our message is very, very simple. This state has not been run well. It is unaffordable, it is unlivable. We are gonna be the change that's gonna make this state affordable and livable. We're gonna start by repealing the gas tax. We're gonna stop the train that's wasting money in the central valley, and we're gonna take some of that money, and we're gonna build roads and bridges. But we're also gonna rebate a portion of that back to the people and refund their registration fees that they've paid under this gas tax. We are gonna bring true change and accountability to this government, true check and balance. And we're gonna make this state affordable and livable. We're gonna make our schools number one. We're gonna help the homeless get back into productive lives. And we're gonna make sure that people can afford a home, afford gasoline, afford electricity, and- I can't tell you about the reaction of your bus. Oh, we've got a great reaction to this bus. I mean, all up and down the highways of this state, we are getting people that honk their horns, give us a thumbs up all across this state. I mean, it is tremendous. And you know, I'll tell you the most important thing. You see that first word? Help. That's what the people of this state are crying out for. Help. Help. Help. They don't want more handouts. What they want is a chance to buy a home. What they want is a chance to have an apartment they can afford. What they want is a chance to be able to fill up their gas tank and not have to worry about whether they're gonna be able to buy groceries next week. What they want is the ability to actually take a shower or a bath because there's water available. This is where the political class and Gavin Newsom have failed. I'm done with failure. I want success for the Golden State. And that's what we're gonna have on November 6th. Let me go. Yeah, let's go. Hey John, thanks. All right. Peter means loser and boy health insurance. Remember that. Thanks. Thank you, all the point. You're doing great. Thank you very much. No, we're practicing. But the next generation, better education. OK, check it out. Everything. It's very long. Yes. Come visit Daniel. Hey, John. Thank you very much. All right, go. Hey, how's my job? All right, thank you. Thank you. I can go. I can go. Yes, you have to go. I want to stay here. I can go. I can go. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Good. Good. Let's do it. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. Good job. Good job, sir. Good job. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. Good job. Good job, sir. Good job. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. All right, guys. Let's turn out some boats here. We're ready to go. Second boat. There are 10 boats turning these boats. I go. We're leaving. I can't wait until I come. Yeah. Two miles. Let's get back to work. All right. Okay. What was that pocket pay on the phone? Because it's working guys. They're out here. They're just paying for you. All right, so what's the point? Hi, Joey. OK. Let's sports stars. They get paid millions dollars. We'll get paid millions dollars. But this impacts our nation in such a huge way. Everything is a state, right? Everything. And in these final days, the only thing that impacts this race above and beyond anything is turning in these votes. For the last year, year and a half, in some cases, beyond volunteers like yourself have been calling voters in the field and asking them what they care about. Do you care about this issue? How do you feel about that issue? Do you support our candidate? Now we're in the final phase of those people who agreed with us, who supported us, who let us know what they're thinking and are going to be getting out to vote, right? So we're not in an NFL stadium. We're not getting paid millions of dollars. But you know what? We're walking on the field right now. This is that high stake level of game. OK, the stakes are that high. So while you're here and sometimes the phones quiet, and we're just waiting to get that caller on the line, think about it. Volunteers like you are going to be here all day, every day. You're going to talk to dozens of people by the end of the day. Dozens of yeses. Dozens of yeses. Dozens of yeses. Dozens of yeses. This adds up. We're in a race. We have this office. We have the office in the harbor. We have the office in your Belinda. Our opponents are doing the same thing. We're in a race right now. Final 72 hours. The contact those most important people make sure they turn in their balance. OK? So just keep in mind when you get someone on the phone. Do you support? Absolutely. Do you need to vote? Can I tell you where your polling place is? Do you need to mail in your ballot? Make sure they understand. OK? So just thank you guys for all the hard work and effort that we put into this. And as soon as this is ready to work on a roll. So does anyone want to give it a shot real quick and since you have to. It's back. It's back on. Hold it back on. Thank you. Thank you. I didn't win the step. I didn't have the, what was the, so I saw you. You followed the order. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Yeah, um, next I'd like to introduce a friend to the KCC, uh, who has just been just phenomenal in support of our group. Whatever we do, whatever we asked, Ed Royce was just there. And Ed Royce was there because Ed Royce has one of the greatest staffers for the last 20 years. And not only is she a great staffer, she's a Korean American who has to heart for the North Korean human rights just like us. And why? Because she wants the suffering to end. And I'd like to introduce to you, Young Kim. Woo! Thank you, everyone, for being here. You may know, just yesterday, the United States Congress passed the North Korea Human Rights Reauthorization Act. And it's been sent to the White House on President's desk to be signed for reauthorization. I believe for the fourth time since it was first introduced and passed in 2004. So I want to thank all of you for your persistency and dedication to this issue to make sure that our, uh, our populations speak for the voiceless people. As you know, as Korea is front and center of the foreign affairs policy lately, it is really important that we continue to speak out on this issue. We all fully appreciate the critical concern over North Korea's continued development of nuclear weapons program. But in no longer threatens just our Asian allies, but also the American homeland, including my fellow citizens in Southern California. However, there is more that is sinister about the Pyongyang regime than its weapons mess destruction. The brutal treatment of the North Korean people by Kim Jong-un and his massive police state stands out as the number one human rights violation in the world today. An estimated 200,000 men and women and children, including underground Christians, English and horrific conditions in North Korea in the place called Kuala Liso. And their English Christ should never be ignored. Starting of such a large number enduring this abuse can be my numbing. Soviet dictators Stalin once reportedly trivialized the suffering of the many stating that the death of one man is a tragedy. The death of millions is a statistic. So let us examine just a few of the individual tragic deaths caused by the murder by the Pyongyang regime. You remember our fellow American, University of Virginia College student Otto Wambir. He returned just a year ago to his grieving parents after suffering and being tortured by the views in Pyongyang only to pass away within a week of his return. And you remember the Christian missionary Reverend Kim Dong-shik. He was kidnapped on the Chinese border into Korean Gulag in 2000. His only crime was to carry on the words of Jesus Christ to be merciful by providing assistance to North Korean refugees. He reportedly died of starvation, torture, lack of medical treatment at a North Korean military base. His body was never recovered. When you guys remember the United States Army captain Arthur Bonifaz, he was killed in the ex-murder in the DMZ in 1976. And you all remember Yugeong-siyo San-nyeom, the former South Korean First Lady who was assassinated by a North Korean agent in Seoul in 1974. And how can we forget, just a year ago, there was the highly publicized murder of Kim Jong-un's own half brother using chemical agents in front of a large crowd at an international airport in Malaysia. These are just some of the most infamous examples of the tragic deaths of individual victims by Pyongyang regime. These murders have continued, unabated under the new regime of Kim Jong-un, just like father, just like the son. So let us pledge here today that these and other victims of the North Korean Kim family will not be forgotten. We cannot forget them. Those languishing in the death camps will not be forgotten, right? We won't forget. We won't forget. Those suffering starvation and malnutrition, including children, will not be forgotten. We won't forget. No Korean refugees on the run in China, Mongolia, Southeast Asia will not be forgotten. We won't forget. We won't forget. And women refugees being sexually trafficked on the Chinese North Korean border will not be forgotten. We won't forget. We won't forget. Ladies and gentlemen, we have to continue to speak for the voiceless of the North Korean people. This is our pledge. This is our sacred duty. Let's keep fighting for our brothers and sisters in North Korea. Thank you very much. Thank you. We have our interns and what do you want to say? Thank you for being the voice for human rights in North Korea. Thank you. The Congress maids ... Yoho ... ... come on up. I'll get it. Thank you. Thank you. Hey. That you? Where are you? Maia Preறing. Did you see me? It's the Korean Cold War. Voting of the North Korea. My name is not Chinese! Do you know I really have a ring! Anyway, I ...",

        "transcript": " So I've been saying a lot of things talking of the people making commentary. Interestingly enough, the ones I've noticed that have been making the commentary are wealthy black people, making the commentary about we should not be brightening, we should not be looking, we should not be tearing up our own communities. And then there's been an argument of the other side of we should be hitting them in the pocket. We should be focusing on the blackout days when we don't spend money. But I feel like we should do both. And I feel like I support both. And I'll tell you why I support both. I support both because when you have a civil unrest like this, there are three type of people in the streets. There are the protesters, there are the rioters, and there are the looters. The protesters are there because they actually care about what is happening in the community, they want to raise their voices, and they are there strictly to protest. You have the rioters who are angry, who are anarchists, who really just want to shit up, and that's what they're going to do regardless. And then you have the looters. And the looters almost exclusively are just there to do that to loot. Now people are like, well what did you gain? Well what did you get from looting? I think that as long as we're focusing on the what? We're not focusing on the why. And that's my issue with that. As long as we're focusing on what they're doing, we're not focusing on why they're doing. And some people are like, well those are people who are legitimately angry about what's happening. Those are people who just want to get stuck. Okay, well then let's go with that. Let's say that's what it is. Let's ask ourselves why in this country in 2020, the financial gap between poor blacks and the rest of the world is at such a distance that people feel like they're only hoping, the opportunity to get some of the things that we flaunt a flash in front of them all the time is to walk through a broken glass window and get it. That they are so hopeless that getting that necklace, getting that TV, getting that change, getting that bed, getting that phone, whatever it is that they're going to get is that in that moment when the riots happen and if they present an opportunity of looting, that's their only opportunity to get it. We need to be questioning that why? Why are people that poor? That are people that broke, why are people that food insecure, that clothing insecure, that they feel like they're only shot, that they are shooting their shot by walking through a broken glass window to get what they need. And then people want to talk about what is plenty of people who pull themselves up out of bootstraps and got it on their own. Why can't they do that? Let me explain to you something about economics in America and I'm so glad that as a child I got an opportunity to spend time at push where they taught me this is that we must never forget that economics was the reason that black people were brought to this country. We came to do the agricultural work in the south and the textile work in the north. Do you understand that? That's what we came to do. We came to do the agricultural work in the south and the textile work in the north. Now if I right now, if I right now decided that I wanted to play monopoly with you and for 400 rounds of playing monopoly I didn't allow you to have any money, I didn't allow you to have anything on the board, I didn't allow for you to have anything. And then we played another 50 rounds of monopoly and everything that you gained and you earned while you were playing that round of monopoly was taking from you. That was Tulsa, that was Rosewood. There are places where we built black economic wealth, where we were self-sufficient, where we owned our stores, where we owned our property and they burned them to the ground. So that's 450 years. So for 400 rounds of monopoly you don't get to play at all. Not only do you not get to play, you have to play on the behalf of the person that you're playing against. You have to play and make money and earn wealth for them and then you have to turn it over to them. So then for 50 years you finally get a little bit and you're allowed to play and every time that they don't like the way that you're playing or that you're catching up or that you're doing something to be self-sufficient they burn your game, they burn your cards, they burn your monopoly money. And then finally at the release and the onset of that they allow you to play and they say, okay now you catch up. Now at this point the only way you're going to catch up in the game is that the person shares the wealth, correct? But what if every time you share the wealth then there's psychological warfare against you to say, oh you're an equal opportunity higher? So if I played 400 rounds of monopoly with you and I had to play and give you every dime that I made and then for 50 years every time that I played, if you didn't like what I did you got to burn it like they did in Tulsa and like they did in Rosewood, how can you win? How can you win? You can't win. The game is fixed. So when they say why do you burn down the community? Why do you burn down your own neighborhood? It's not ours. We don't own anything. We don't own anything. There is Trevor Noah said it's so beautifully last night. There's a social contract that we all have that if you steal or if I steal then the person who is the authority comes in and they fix the situation. But the person who fixes the situation is killing us. So the social contract is broken. And if the social contract is broken, why the fuck do I give a shit about burning the football hall of fame, about burning a fucking target? You broke the contract. When you killed us in the streets and then give up. You broke the contract from 400 years. We played your game and built your wealth. You built the contract when we built our wealth again on our own by our bootstraps, same tossa, and you dropped bombs on us. When we built it in Rosewood and you came in and you swatted us. You broke the contract. So your target, your hall of fame. Far as I'm concerned I could burn this bitch to the ground. And it still wouldn't be enough. And they are lucky that what black people are looking for is equality and not revenge.",

        "transcript": " Well, just days after a surprisingly warm, oval office meeting with President Trump, New York City's mayor-elect, Democratic Socialists, Zoraan Mamdani, is doubling down on calling the president a fascist and a despot, even as he says they agree on the city's affordability crisis. This comes days after the House overwhelmingly passed a measure condemning socialism. Republican California Congresswoman Young Kim said this on the House floor before that vote. As a Korean-American who grew up in the aftermath of the Korean War, I have witnessed the horrors of socialism first-hand. If you want to see the difference between socialism and freedom, just look at the Korean peninsula and night. South Korea shines with opportunity. North Korea is trapped in darkness. Socialist ideas gained traction here at home. And as our nation's largest city and financial capital has elected not just a socialist, but a communist as mayor, we must firmly demand our capitalist free-market system, which empowers Americans of all backgrounds to achieve freedom, opportunity, and prosperity. President Obama, Congresswoman Kim joins us now. Congresswoman, Congresswoman, thank you for being with us today. Great remarks on the House floor, but apparently a lot of Americans, maybe especially young people, aren't necessarily believing them because Zoraan Mamdani got elected. Why? Well, look, first of all, let me talk about my quick, you know, why I'm so passionate that we need to denounce socialism. And my parents left North Korea during the Korean War to escape socialism and threats of communism. And I grew up hearing about the dangers of living in those repressive society. And because my parents made the sacrifice to yet again immigrate my family to America, I'm lucky to be living in a land of the free and live the American dream. I want the same for my children and grandchildren. And that's why, as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, after decades of being in the United States, I am so fortunate to say that the satellite images in the Korean Peninsula and night is what is going to make the difference between socialism and freedom. That's why I said, compared South Korea, that shines with prosperity and opportunity while North Korea is trapped with repression and darkness. And my mother-in-law risked her life crossing DMs in multiple times to rescue her loved ones from the North Korean regime. So I grew up knowing and hearing about what the socialism would do to a, you know, one's country, family, and, you know, taking away the freedom. But there are American young people who didn't have the experience you did, who didn't, you know, start out life in a communist country, who really think that socialism is a great thing. Charlie Kirk talked about it at the Turning Point USA summit back in July. Listen. Now, we should booze, oh, Ron Mamdanic, but we fail to understand why he is rising. There's a deeper thing at play. Younger voters are trying to get their leader's attention. We can't afford anything. Homes are out of reach. I'm tired of renting all the time and I have zero equity to my name. If we do not solve the economic disorder that is facing this generation from the debts, the deficits, student loan debt, cost of living, then Mamdani will just be the beginning of what you're going to see in communities across the country. He calls it economic disorder and it comes under a capitalist system, does it not? Well, first of all, I was very pleasantly surprised with the Mamdani and President Trump meeting, but I was also relieved to see President Trump giving him a warm welcome to the White House, indeed, exchange, culture, exchanges. So I think this is what I think was happening. I believe President Trump was almost like the President Trump cheering on the sun was returning home, trying to live from a better field, right? But they are meeting turned out to be surprising, the amicable, at least optically wise. But I think that's because they both went into the meeting with a purposeful attitude. One thing was certain, they both passionately loved New York City, but they have areas of disagreements, but they focus on what they want and do in terms of making life affordable and cost of living and addressing the public safety issues. But behind the post-doors, I think President Trump may have given him some bodily advice. They cannot find common ground on socialism. But I believe they had a hard-to-hard conversation and they tried to find common ground on how to drive New York City forward, which in turn would drive America forward. That's exactly what President Trump was doing. And that's why President Trump wished him well and he said, the better he does than happy who I am and I'll be cheering for him. To be honest, I as President Trump said, I want my life to be in the right direction. But I want to thank him for the hard-working New York City residents for the American people. But let's be realistic here. They agreed on what the share of policy concerns are, like the cost of living, rent, utilities, housing, and affordability of public safety. But I would cautiously watch where they align on how to solve those issues. Remember, President Trump is a conservative populist Republican. And Dany, describes himself as a democratic socialist. We cannot let dangerous socialist ideologies sneak into our nation under the guise of rent, control, housing, and free-brew streets. Mandani can't pay on those issues. Americans are not stupid, right? They are worried about affordability, but they also know that freedom isn't free. Everything comes in a price. If you don't pay it at the counter, the bills still comes due. Because of all these swipes, your liberties to cover the tap. So I wish we can find some common ground, and I want him to succeed. But again, for the sake of hard-working Americans, and I was studying with the New York City residents. Yeah, he has promised New York City a lot of free stuff. We'll see how it all turns out. Republican, California Congresswoman, Young Kim. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews.

        "transcript": " Congresswoman Kim, you were in the room as the Ukrainian President Zelensky asked for more U.S. assistance. That was followed by President Biden's announcement that, indeed, an additional $800 million in military aid was headed to Ukraine and the form of various weapons and weapon systems. Can you take us inside that room? Tell us about the effective President Zelensky's address to Congress and whether you think the U.S. is doing enough to help. Sure. First of all, Frank, thank you very much for having me. Yes, I was in the room and it was very emotional. And it was a real moment when Democrats and Republicans came together to show our strong United States support for Ukraine and also show our admiration for President Zelensky's leadership and bravery, which was on full display. I truly believe he is a bright leader for Ukraine at such time as this. In my view, he's a hero and he knows how to rally not only his people in Ukraine but the people around the world. And his message to us is very clear that he's not going to give up. They're going to continue to fight and neither can we. So the message he's given to us is that we need to do more for Ukraine because they need help now. So to that end, I think that we've done so far whatever we can, Congress passing the Ukraine aid last week and President Biden following up with the $800 million in additional support. We continue to do more because we need to do – I'm urging President Biden to organize an international humanitarian airlift to provide non-military supplies into Ukraine. You know, we've seen many aid convoys sticking to entering Ukraine to its cities, but the effort has been stopped because Russian forces are blocking or destroying the transportation method. So we need to provide the airlift to bring in these non-military supplies as soon as possible. And I think there is definitely a room for doing more. Congressman Kim, on Friday, you introduced the Dictator Act. It's a bipartisan effort to investigate whether the Chinese government is helping Russia to circumvent the sanctions levied by the U.S. and other countries. Is there any evidence at this point to suggest that that's actually happening? We truly believe because of the intelligence community that – remember just recently, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Li, he continues to say that Russia is China's most important strategic partner. And we know that as Russia continues to invade Ukraine, we know China is in Taiwan. So we want to be there to protect our ally, Taiwan, and we have to show dictators that they cannot invade a free country, who is a true economic trade partner with the United States for these unprovoked – without – you know, unprovoked – invasion without secure consequences. That's why I introduced the Dictator Act. And this is truly a bipartisan effort. And this bill is directing the State Department to investigate and report to Congress if and how Chinese government and its affiliated entities are helping Russia to invade the U.S. sanctions that we put in place after Putin's Ukraine invasion. And I truly believe that this will set us up for the picture that we come up with a strategy to block economic support from China to Russia. You're also leading an effort to urge the Meta-CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to block Chinese government-backed groups who are pushing Russian propaganda on Facebook and other meta-platforms. What's the impact you're seeing of these ads? And have you had any response yet for Mr. Zuckerberg or from Meta? Well, first of all, we just send a letter and we're waiting – we give – we give him time by the end of this month or sooner to give us a feedback. The broader issue is China is helping Russia. And I wrote a letter to Zuckerberg with several requests, including what steps are you taking to monitor non-Russian outlets, spreading this information during this Ukraine invasion? And what resources and staffing they have dedicated to fight this information campaigns? You see, Meta had a policy from 2020 to block state-controlled outlets from buying advertising in the United States. So we're asking if they're expanding that policy to global advertisements. And we've also seen how Russian intelligence is saying China is planning to invade Taiwan this fall. So we want to make sure that we're there. We're ready to support and protect our ally Taiwan when that happens.",

        "transcript": " Good evening and welcome to the Cree Society's third episode in our Women's Leadership and the US Korea Relationship Series. I'm Tom Burn, President and CEO of the Cree Society here in New York City. Our Women's Leadership Series highlights the achievements and the important role Korean and Korean American women leaders play in their own countries as well as on the global stage. And also we look at the contributions that are like they hear about the contributions they have made strengthening the bonds between the people of Korea and America. The Cree Society is honored tonight to feature Congresswoman Young Kim, one of the Korean American women trailblazers serving in the US House of Representatives. We will hear from Congresswoman Kim on how as an immigrant she pursued the American dream to become a successful Korean American leader and politician. Congresswoman Kim represents California's 39th District which includes parts of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties. Congresswoman Kim started her public service as director of community relations and Asian affairs for former congressman Ed Royce. Prior to serving in Congress, Congresswoman Kim was the first ever Korean American Republican woman to serve in the California State Assembly. California State Assembly. She is also a small business owner, a long time community leader and has been actively involved in numerous organizations throughout the 39th District. Also she was recently appointed as a co-chair of the Congressional Study Group on Korea, operating within a partnership formed by the Society and the Association of Former Members of Congress. There are only two other bilateral study groups composed of sitting members of Congress, Japan and Germany, but the Korea Group is the newest established rather recently in 2018. I am very excited to see that Congresswoman Kim will play a key role in strengthening the relationship between these two great democracies, Korea and America. Tonight Ambassador Kathleen Stevens, whom we featured in the inaugural Women's Leadership Program, will moderate the conversation. Ambassador Stevens is the board chair of the Korea Society, a former U.S. Ambassador to Korea, and is also serving as President and CEO of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington DC. Please join me in welcoming Congresswoman Kim and Ambassador Stevens. I hope you all enjoy the conversation between two highly accomplished leaders. Thank you Kathy, the screen is yours. Thank you very much and hello to everyone joining us. Today I am so thrilled to have our third episode, as Tom mentioned of the Korea Society's Women's Leadership Series, and we are so honored to have Congresswoman Kim join us for this evening. Congresswoman, welcome. Your life, your career, which I follow as I know many people who are turning in have for some time, they really personify the themes that we are trying to explore in this series. And you set an example of public service and leadership that is not only inspiring, but something I think we can really learn from. So we have a lot to cover tonight. Thank you so much for making time. I know you are coming from votes and it's always busy on the hill, but it seems especially that way today. So thank you very much. Thank you very much for having me and it's an honor to be joined by you and have this conversation. I look forward to it. Thank you. Well, I want to say a belated congratulations in person. This passes for in person on your election to be US Congress representing California's 39th District. And I know the audience is very eager to hear your thought about the many, many challenges our country faces that we all face as Americans, Asian, Korean Americans as women as citizens committed to a strong relationship between the United States and Korea and many other things. But if you would indulge us, before we get to all that, I know our audience and I also would really like to explore a little bit your own journey and learn a little bit more about you. I know that you were born in Seoul and as Tom mentioned, I think we've seen you say that your family came to America to pursue the American dream. Can you tell us a little more about that? What drew your parents here and what it was like for you and your family to settle in the US? Sure. First of all, I don't think I can talk like this with the president. I know many of our audience are Korean speakers too. I'm sure they understood what I just said. But thank you. Thank you for inviting me to participate in this Women's Leadership Series. And I'm really honored to have this conversation with you and to all of our audience listening in. I want to extend my warm greetings. You mentioned the American dream that I'm living and it's been a privilege and honor for me to talk about it along the journey that got me to where I am. And just like most immigrant families, my family came to the US for the hope and opportunity that this country provided that is to seek a better life, especially coming from Korea after the Korean War. I was born like just a decade after the Korean War. So you can see what my younger days in Korea would have been like. And so it wasn't easy for my parents who sacrificed a lot when they decided to emigrate my family to the US. And that was like four and a half decades ago. And I saw my parents over 50 years of old and older in my death case. But they came here and struggled to settle into this new country and provide for their family. And the youngest of what used to be seven, but there are five of us left now because two of my older brothers passed away. And we struggled with initially with language barriers navigating through a new society. But I can tell you now it was totally, totally worth it. And growing up on the island of Guam, I remember regularly going down to the beach and my mom and I would pick up cans and bottles. At the time, I thought it was a cleanup project, but any money that we made from that recycling project, we gave it back to church. And that was a very modest way of my mom teaching me the humility. And she would always tell me, you know, young, whenever you can, whenever we can, we have to get back to the community in this country that has given us so much opportunities. And her words left a very, very lasting impression on me. So you were the youngest in your family of siblings when you came over. So in some ways, perhaps that helped because you were a little younger when you started to learn English. How old were you? But you probably also had some special responsibilities too. Yes. You know, I was, I finished elementary school when my parents came over here. So I too had the difficulty, you know, because I didn't speak a word of English when I came here. So it was all learning experience. And at 12, 13 years old, I remember helping my parents to go to the DMB together to get their license, translating. When I didn't know that I wasn't even fluent in English myself. So those are the memories that I have. But like I said, the journey of living the American dream today, it was totally worth any difficulties and challenges we had to overcome. We are life speaks to that, but you really had to take a lot of responsibility early too. In many ways, I have to ask you, especially since you're from Southern California. And have you seen the movie Meenati? And I mean, that talks about an immigrant experience said in the 1980s, I think. So maybe slightly later than you, not too much. And in a very different part of the country, but have you seen it? Yes. Your reaction to it. You know, actually, I did watch that Minari with my husband and my daughters. And I know it was a story that resonated with me and so many Korean American immigrants. Since, you know, when we first came to America, we actually settled in Guam first. And then I went to Hawaii to finish my high school. And then I came to California. I remember telling my parents, as much as I love living on the island, you know, that is too small for me. This little girl, you know, born and raised in my earlier days in Inchan, which is famous for MacArthur landing. I mean, so I was born by the water and growing up on the island of Guam in Hawaii, I said, you know, I need to get out into the bigger world. And so this, that journey took over the Pacific Ocean, getting me to California, going to USC. And I remember just going through the difficult times because I had to pay and put myself to the college. But it taught me my resilience and perseverance. And I hope Minari resonates with many people as it did to me and my family. And I hope that it gives everyone an understanding of the experience of immigrants and an appreciation of the American dream. Yeah, I saw it too. And I had to say, I thought it was a quintessentially American story, you know, and with a very Korean flavor and with people understanding about Minari and perseverance. But I actually had grandparents who had a farm in Arkansas earlier in the 20th century. And you know, just seeing it made me think so much about that extraordinary experience of these cultures coming together and that experience. Yeah, I thought it was very, very moving. I want to pick up your journey in California and on from there. But I also want to ask you while we're still kind of talking about looking back towards days in Korea, how much do you still maintain many contacts in Korea? I know obviously we'll talk about it. You're very active in Korean American relations from the point of view of your current responsibilities and previous things you've done. And do you visit Korea often and do you like all of this kind of go back and think, oh, my goodness, it's changed so much since I was there six months ago or now maybe it's a year. Yeah, you know, yes, on that note, I do have family members, actually my aunt and her siblings, which are my extended family members and cousins, they still live in Korea. And during my time, as you know, I was a long time congressional staff working with former chairman at Royce, I had numerous opportunities to travel to Korea in that capacity. And along the way, I made a lot of friends and we still maintain good relationship with many people, both on the professional and personal level. And the development of technology like KakaoTalk, we call it KakaoTalk, has made it so much easier to communicate with my family and friends overseas. So I've been fortunate to keep in touch with them regularly. But every time I visit Korea, I am amazed by how much Korea has changed since I left as a young girl. And it has literally reasoned from the ashes of the aftermath of the Korean War to become the center of technology and economic superpower. You remember when you served as the master in South Korea and I know you've seen all that what I'm describing, you know, there is a term that the miracle of Han River. And so I think you and I share the amazing development and we've seen the incredible testament to the resilience of the Korean people. No, absolutely. And it really is, I mean, one of the most extraordinary, I mean, blessings of my life to have seen over, I confess now, it's almost 50 years. That's one thing about getting older and to think, you know, and reflect, of course, everywhere has changed. But the journey of Korea really is quite remarkable. One thing that I think we're finding and I want to get your thoughts on this as we move along a little later on is people are, of course, interested in many things about Korea because of its culture, its history, its journey. But I think there's also a sense, there's a lot to learn from Korea now too, whether it's in public health or sustainable economic growth or a lot of other issues that I know there are very much on your agenda and many of your colleagues. But I want to get back to your own journey for a minute because we're trying to focus on, you know, leadership development as well as a US career relations. And I know you move to California and obtained a degree, I think, in business administration. And then unlike a lot of people who study mid-minute, you actually started your own business. But I also understand that you had a radio show and a television show called LA Soul with Young Kim and Radio Soul. So what I was interested in about that is you clearly drew from your business administration studies and the entrepreneurial skills you were developing and your own Korean-American identity. So I think we'd be interested in kind of how you kind of figured that out because that was fairly early on, I think, to do some of those things, particularly as a young woman. You know, actually, I graduated from college and I remember, first of all, you know, as an immigrant and my parents who had the equivalence of a elementary school in Korea, for them, seeing their youngest child walking across the stage to receive my college diploma and finding a good-paying job. They were hoping that I would find somebody good and find a good husband, start a family. And then when they saw that I started as a financial analyst in the first day state holding company, I mean, it's now Wells Fargo, right? But then eventually I started running my own business. To them, it seemed like the ultimate American dream. And you know, it would have been something that my parents' generation would say, wow, we achieved the American dream. But for me, that was only the beginning. My parents lived a simple life and taught us humility. But I was fortunate to be surrounded by people who encouraged me to pursue higher goals and venture into uncharted territory, like hosting a television talk show. And I did that for about 10 years. First as a KSCI-generating, now it's called LA Seoul in Southern California. And then eventually at Adidas TV, also doing a second season of a real talk. So I got all these opportunities, but I wasn't comfortable doing that in the beginning. But I give a lot of credit to my husband, we've been married for 35 years. He graduated high school before he emigrated to United States. So his Korean was fluent. He encouraged me to actually take on that challenge. And he helped me to fine tune my Korean skills. So I looked and sounded good on TV instead of speaking Congolese, right? So when you have the opportunity, just go for it. And that's what I did. And I had good support system to help me get through. Yeah, so you actually, I mean, having come to the US to Guam as a middle school student essentially, and then living in the US and being educated in English all this time, then you took on to actually be a television radio person in Korea. And that's very brave. Yes. So my Korean wasn't, I mean, Korean, I mean, English wasn't so perfect at the time because I was still trying to assimilate. But at the same time, my Korean was like elementary school level. But over the time, you know, just like anything, language, linguistic skill is something the more you speak, the more you feel comfortable. And I was able to just hone my skills along the way. Yeah, well, I know that. I mean, I feel like I've made it more than most, but maybe Miner, I don't know how much work that takes, but also it takes some courage too. Because certainly I've observed that, you know, if you look like I do, and you speak some Korean, I mean, Korean kind of give you a pass. It's, oh, that's good, that's good. But if you look Korean, you know, it's like they're very exacting. You know, they're so, they can be very demanding. So I thought to you. Yeah. I've come a long way. No. So, but you did then. You said that wasn't enough. You then moved from the private sector into public service. And you've done, you know, the work as a staff member is a California State Assembly member and run for office. And I think you, you ran twice before you were elected. So that takes a lot of perseverance too. Can you tell us a little bit about, there are a lot of people never make that transition, never mind from business to public service. But then from a staff position to actually putting yourself out there and running for office. What was that like for you and where there's some, I imagine there'd be some challenges and maybe some advantages to being a woman, to being Korean-American, to, you know, your own identity, a little bit about that journey. Sure. You know, as a matter of fact, I talked about my husband's son earlier, but I give a lot of credit to him. I mean, he's a winner. I mean, to put up with me and really encourage me, you know, when your husband and your male spouse, your partner really encourage you, that is more credit to them than myself. So I really thank him for the support that he's given me and the support that I get from my grown-up children now. Between the two of us, we have four. They've always been there to support me along this journey. But it was my husband Charles, who encouraged me and taught me the value of serving our community as a volunteer. Charles Kim is a founder and past president of the Korean-American Coalition. You probably heard that. It's a non-profit group that was established in 1983 to advocate and empower our Korean-American community and focus on leadership development. And it was through him. When I first met Dan, state senator at Roy's at an event, it was like an early 90s. And our initial meeting led to Mr. Roy is asking him if I would continue to work with him. So that led to working initially in your state senate office and then eventually moved on to continue to serve with him more than two decades as his director of community relations and Asian affairs in his congressional office. And from there, it was both my husband Charles and my former boss at Roy's who encouraged me to run for office. The way I started was it was not something that I planned on, but in 2012, after we lost a state assembly seat in North Orange County to a Democrat, think about that. Orange County once read County, we had lost a seat to a Democrat. So at that time, Mr. Roy sent me down and I thought it was just having a regular conversation. But at that time, he said, young, we need to find a candidate to run against this Democrat state assembly member. Granted, she had just literally won a few weeks before and she hasn't even been sworn into office, but he said, we need to find somebody and somebody fast so we can start working on this. And I said, oh, sure, boss, I'll look for somebody. And he said, no, I think we have a perfect candidate. Look no farther. You'll be great. Like, huh? You know, that's how he started. But I went on to win that seat in 2014. That's how I became the first Korean American Republican woman to serving California state assembly. And now, when he said he's going to retire at the end of 2018, I ran. But as you know, I narrowly lost that election. It was heartbreaking. But after analyzing what happened and seeing where this country was headed because of so much partisanship that we see and the lack of representation that I saw representing me in my 39th district, I decided to run again. I'm glad I did because I'm here. The world goes winners don't quit, right? So I didn't quit. Right. Congratulations. And you came out of this background with very deep roots in your district and in your community, which I think does. Sometimes it's more reflected. I think in some of the women members of Congress, right, who often come with those, those, they say starting even with volunteer work and other things and really developing those ties. So I'd love to hear a little bit more about your district. I mean, I do know something about it. And, but what are you, what are you hearing from constituents? I mean, you just came through the election. But now you're here. It's been quite an initial several months. It this is definitely not the way I wanted to start my first term or let alone the first month in Congress, but we're making the most of it. I know why I'm here to represent not only the 39th district, but all Americans and using my story. I'm hoping that I can inspire others to do the same and know that they too can realize the American dream. But the 39th district spans across parts of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties and it's one of the most diverse districts in the country. And I think like many communities, the 39th district has been bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic and our small businesses, which is probably, I mean, this is a suburban district. So there are a lot of small and mid-sized businesses and they've been hurting and individuals have been hit hard by unemployment as well as California's, you know, California lockdown. You know, so people want to safely reopen and get back to normal. So that is a number one priority for me to make sure that happens. But in my district in Southern California, infrastructure has also been a big issue with the 57, 60-fold confluence highway that is known as the worst truck bottleneck in the state and other issues with rows and highways. And we have, even though it's not directly in my district, it's very close to the ports of Los Angeles and San Pedro and all of the goods that are coming out of the ports runs through my district along the 57, 60-free way. So infrastructure, freeways, these are very, very important for me. But, you know, additionally, many foreign policy issues directly impact many of my constituents from trade to our key relationship with allies in Asia and Central America. And this is also home to Cal State Fullerton. And this is a Hispanic-serving institution as well as where three of my four kids, they went to Cal State Fullerton. So I'm a tight, you know, tightens at heart, even though I'm a Trojan. Not that said. And what about immigration? Is that, does that play as a big issue in your district? Would you say? Yes, we're this. It certainly does, because as I mentioned, it's a very diverse district and where one-third of our constituency are Asian-Americans and it's one-third Hispanic and one-third Caucasian. So we have a lot of immigrants, legal immigrants that are making their livelihood and making this home. And we all want to encourage others to come but do it the right way and legal way. So it is a very important issue and I hope that I can add my unique perspective as an immigrant who has come here and now that the discussion is ongoing in Congress. I hope that we can find some common sense immigration reform because it's been broken for so long. And I definitely want to work on that issue. So it is a very, very important key policy areas that I want to focus on. Well, certainly to those of us, at least outside of politics, it would seem like immigration and infrastructure, two issues on which there can and should be real bipartisan efforts. So it's good to hear you emphasizing that, yeah. You've mentioned a couple of times and I know you on your website as well how powerful your own experience and your family's experience of the American dream is. And I think for my generation too, we feel it very powerfully. But I'm worried a bit that in the US and actually in Korea as well, that younger people increasingly feel that that dream is really out of reach for them, whether it's because of growing inequalities of opportunity or wealth or the crisis that we're in now that is really out of reach. In fact, I've seen this even more in South Korea, and then Lou, but later on that feeling coming into the US. I mean, do you see that too? And how do you respond to that? You know, certainly our job as policymakers is to make sure that all Americans, especially the younger generation that you talk about, can access the opportunities to succeed. So the policies that come out of Washington and Sacramento that I've seen have been making it more difficult to achieve the American dream. They make our lives hotter, more expensive, and they are making it impossible for middle-class families to get by. So I realized that we need to work to lower taxes and healthcare costs and strengthen our schools, which is part of the reason why many immigrants come to this country because we know America provides quality education, but we need to make sure that there is quality education and opportunities that are available, but also we need to work to revitalize our economy. But obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic in particular has left many feeling out of luck. But I think we are reaching a light at the end of the tunnel as more people receive vaccines so we can safely reopen. And I also said that for big things to get done in Congress, we must come together and find common ground and working a bipartisan way. There are more things that unite us if we can keep an open mind. And along the way, as I was campaigning, I've heard over and over from the voters and the constituents. People are sick of partisan gridlock and they want to see their elected officials getting things done. So when I came to Congress, I joined the bipartisan problem solvers, and I'm working with my colleagues across the aisle to introduce bipartisan bills. And that's why I'm so excited that so far in less than 100 days I've been in office, three of my bills have already passed the house and one has already become law. And all three of these bipartisan bills are an effort to help small businesses. Because I say there is hope. And I hope I can keep doing my part and make a positive impact in Washington. Well, congratulations on that. That is, I think you're absolutely right that there is a very deep desire in this country for bipartisan solutions. And I know you've been a very strong voice in that. And particularly, I know you're also now the Republican Vice Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Study Group on Korea, which is a study group that was established relatively recently in 2018. I know that there have been a long tradition of study groups, congressional study groups looking at Japan, looking at Germany that have been around for decades. So again, I think it's a sign, well, you can tell me, but a sign of Korea's growing salience and importance that we now have a congressional study group devoted to Korea. But that's just a background of saying, do you think that the Congress is paying enough attention to Korea? Would you like to see some more and are there particular issues that you think deserve some more attention? It's a very full agenda, whether you're in the Congress or in the administration. But also given meortize and your husband's ties as well to the deep ties of the Korean American community. I wonder if you see both in your district and more broadly, if you see the Korean American community, which is tough, is very diverse. But are they focused on particular areas? Or do you think that their concerns are larger, if I could buy the larger other constituencies as well? Sorry, I have a lot of questions, but I should turn that question of US Korean relations because now you're in, you know, you're such an important voice and as you have been for years, but particularly now. You know, as you mentioned, given the importance and relevance of the issues stemming from the Korean Peninsula, Korea should absolutely draw greater attention from the Hill. And now that I'm here, now that there are four Korean American serving in Congress to Democrats, to Republicans, truly bipartisan, I say. You know, so I think there will be more focus on Korea. And I'm really glad and honored to be serving in the capacity as a vice chair on the congressional study group on Korea. Even though the congressional study group on Korea was only established recently, you know, I am so glad that my counterpart, Congressman Amibera and I get to serve together. So we're looking to take a number of issues surrounding the US-Korea alliance and challenges from North Korea, actually. So in particular, I hope that Congress and the administration will pay special attention to the humanitarian situation in North Korea. And hope that we will act swiftly to provide relief while holding the Kim regime accountable for its human rights abuses. You know, for these reasons, I have repeatedly urged the Biden administration and, you know, I've actually sent a bipartisan letter to the President Biden to appoint a special envoy on North Korean human rights issues to coordinate our approach to these issues. And furthermore, I hope to work within the study group to promote reunification issues, such as the reuniting of Korean Americans with their war and torn families in North Korea. And I've been fortunate to have a co-sponsor and co-lead two bills on this. And I hope to raise it further among our group membership. And as you know, just today, we had a Foreign Affairs Committee mark-up session, including these two bills that I just mentioned. So I hope that it will come to the floor swiftly, so I get to vote on it and get the passage out of it, too. So we are working our- I'll make sure that Korea is on top of the plate and front-banner. And we may have a visit from the South Korean President, I guess, later or next month. So another reason, hopefully, that you can move these things forward. That's very welcome news. You know, you mentioned that I too was thrilled. I have to say that to see in the last election, not only for Korean Americans elected to the Congress, but as you say, I mean, to Korea, to Republicans, to Democrats, to- I guess three from the West Coast, one from the East Coast. And- but that's all three women. Zero to three. So- And he's lucky. Yes, he's around it by three ladies. So you're a pretty tight group, huh? Yes, we are. Yes, we are. You know, so the four of us, you know, everywhere we go, we are rarely mentioned separately, especially in the case of my dear friend and colleague and my sister, Michelle Still, from Orange County. We are always mentioned together in any of our public appearances or even the interviews. So yeah, we are currently working together to bring bipartisan awareness to important issues that affect, especially our Korean American community, which is the reason why we're able to work together to introduce that bipartisan bill to allow the Korean American families to be included in the next round of Korean Unification when we, you know, when we do this. So I'm so glad that that bill just got passed out of the Foreign Affairs Committee during the markup session. And you also may know that there is a gentleman that I greatly admire who is no longer with us, but Colonel Young-Kam. I enjoyed knowing him and getting to work with him in our community through Korean American coalition, Korean American youth community and many other organizations. He's, you know, we are working to, you know, work on a bipartisan bill to provide him with the belated Post-Mas congressional goal matter to Colonel Young-Kam. And we introduced it together. It was a bipartisan bill. And if we don't do it as Korean American legislators working in Congress, I don't know who will pay attention to this. So these are just some of the examples I mentioned, but I hope we can continue to work together to bring awareness on these issues, plus many more that is impacting our community. Yeah. And I mean, in addition to, I mean, all the things you've mentioned to the importance of the specific issue itself, I mean, the reunification of families, the honoring of people, it does you say brings awareness to people to a broader audience who think they know something about Korea, but I mean, I still find after all these years, I'm constantly discovering the richness, you know, in the depth of this relationship. So highlighting all that and you have a great platform to do it is a very welcome and important thing. I'm going to shift back a little bit before I actually, in a way, women and leadership, although men and leadership also have children, but you did mention, and we know you're the proud mother of four children, it's because they all went to school at a great university. But I wanted to ask you both, women always get asked this question, but we're always curious. How do you manage that? And I'm going to take your husband's part of the secret sauce here. But also in addition to that, I mean, how you've managed it, I mean, your thoughts going back to some of the policy things you're focused on about how the pandemic has affected women now, you know, in terms of making that work life balance even harder as we've had to juggle with education and so on. Yeah. I mean, you're right. I'm very fortunate. I'm proud mother of four and you wouldn't believe it because my name is young. So I always joke around, you know, I'm forever young, even if my husband grows old, right? My children are really 34, 31, 29 and 26. So when they see that, then my kids are this old, they go, no way, you know, so how old were you when you got married? You know, I always say, I'm only 15 and I'm forever 29, right? But women and mothers, especially, you know, had to resolve conflicts and get things done. And I've seen that as I was raising my four kids, there is always two versus two always teaming up sometimes first and last one and sometimes, you know, first and second, but I've been able to balance and, you know, I'm a Libra. I was born in the year of the Tiger. So I pride myself and call myself a Tiger mob. You know, when you see your four children have grown up and they all turned out okay. I think I deserve that title, right? But, you know, my kids are grown up now, but I have great empathy for parents with young kids, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, having to juggle their jobs and working at home, all of a sudden finding themselves to be, you know, not only a room mom and volunteering once in a while in classroom, you're actually trying to be a teacher and doing everything. So I really empathize with them and I really give them a lot of credit, but I'm very excited that we now have more women serving in Congress. And I hope that we can come together to create policies that support women. Do you think that there will be a greater role for eyes or in the public sector for things like childcare and support for working mothers or? I mean, I think there was a natural because again, we have, you know, in this, especially in class of 2020, we have young mothers, some single mothers with young kids. Look, for example, Julia Letlow, you know the story about her husband who was elected with my class, but just days before he was sworn in, he unfortunately passed due to COVID. But she took the torch and decided to just jump in the race to carry out the legacy that he had. And she had, she's a mother of very young two kids, like four years old and two years old. I mean, I give her a lot of credit. And with that, obviously, we are talking about balancing work, life, being a mom, and she's obviously work at a university. So she's a working professional. And we talk about how we can manage all of that. But you know, if we talk about childcare at workplaces, I think those are natural things that we would be working on as a woman working in this environment. So yeah, I see that coming out. It's good to have some legislators who have that personal experience, right? That's help. You know, I mean, again, you have such an inspiring story, but I have to ask you too. I mean, certainly there's probably been some times when you faced stereotypes because of your gender or your ethnicity or even barriers because your Korean American or because if your background is an immigrant. And I know people have been interested in any story you might tell of how you dealt with that or advice about that or maybe not. But it's a tough story. It's all about attitude. You know, if you think you are faced with a discrimination, but you know how you deal with it, how you tough it out. I think it all depends on who you are and what kind of personality you have. But I think the fact that we have so many historic number of women in Congress today shows how far women have come and getting into leadership positions. And so I say, you know, you have to be confident and don't let others perceptions of you hold you back from achieving your dreams. And I'm grateful for the woman that paved the way for someone like me to be in this position. And there have certainly been some haters along the way. And I've dealt with stereotype, you know, such as when I travel on Kodal with members of Congress, I'm perceived to be just a lowly junior staff or just a translator, especially when I go to Korea, you know, or just someone who is caring and delivering coffee. But you know, I just make sure that I didn't let those perceptions define me or stop me from performing my duties. Right. No, it's an issue in Korea, it's still an issue in this country. That's right. Yeah. And we, yeah. But yes, I think you and I both seem quite a bit of change too, which is good. Yes. But also on a kind of a very painful topic. And I know you've been active on it, you know, in recent weeks and months, we've seen the Asian community and especially Asian women, the victims of horrible hate crime attacks and worse. And I think certainly now there's, I hear and I wonder what you're hearing that among many communities, there's a, there's a, a, a, awareness and a worry about, you know, going out and about in public and how and what might happen. I just wonder, you know, what you think can be done about that either at the, at the public policy level or at the individual level. I know there has been some legislation on the Hill. And in fact, I heard something was in the Senate today, but what is, what's the, what's your advice here and what do you think the right approaches? You know, you talk about the legislation. I did sign on to a bill that would create a bipartisan commission to look into these hate crimes. So we can create a lasting solution. But I think it's really important to remember that we cannot legislate hate out of our hearts and minds. Real change happens with each of us taking personal responsibility. So I'll continue to work to help heal our divisions while speaking out for the AAPI community. And, you know, because this, you know, crimes against Asian community has been, you know, on the rise, especially because of the COVID. But I think the more of us in leadership positions, speaking out for the AAPI community, and as it experienced bias and attack, I think that's important. But I just want to say that the rise in violence and hateful actions we have seen across US communities, especially during COVID-19 pandemic is just a poran. It's unacceptable and has to stop. But I think with, we speak out and it's more important that like I said, either legislation that I helped to introduce will help to create a commission to really look into this so that we can prevent future crimes from occurring. And when it does, we have a way to try to solve it. And speaking out is so important. Yeah, it's very disturbing. I know you've been very generous with your time after a very, very busy day. And I don't want to tell you too long, but I do want to say, I mean, first of all, much as the Korea Society President, Tom Burns, at the beginning, we really do appreciate, you know, your continued engagement, not just starting this year or three years ago, but for many, many years in a whole range of activities related to strengthening the ties between the United States and Korea, between the people. I mean, again, you personify that between the people of the United States and the people of Korea. That's what the Korea Society is set up to do. And, you know, I welcome any advice you have or thoughts on how the Korea Society can play this role better. We certainly are trying to reach out beyond New York City. Well, we're all reaching out in the virtual world now, trying to use the virtual world we have, but really look at some of the shared challenges we face. But we certainly look for your engagement and also your counsel and advice on how we can do this better. Yeah, you know, certainly I'm really excited to work with my colleagues and leading that important bipartisan discussion on the issues that affect US-Korea relationship. And in fact, hopefully, as an Asian American who is fully bilingual, bicultural, but you're included too because you're bilingual, bicultural now, you know, you may not look like me, Korean, but you speak Korean. So after this, I know you can, you and I can go off and have a drink and speak in Korean. I know you can do that. So I think between the two of us, again, as leaders, you know, I think we can bring unique perspectives, focusing more on people to people, public diplomacy. And I already discussed this before, but it's worth repeating that, you know, there are a lot of issues that require our attention and immediate action, such as the division of families across North and South Korea and on the Korean diaspora. So I'm glad to see that the bills that we are talking about, including the Korean Americans in this next round of, you know, unification process, these are the ways that we can, you know, advocate on these issues and use our positions and our voices. But more importantly, using, you know, your organization and my position in hearing Congress, we need to continue to speak out on the human rights situation in North Korea, because that's an issue which I hope to shine a light on as a co-chair of the Korea study group. And our country and its allies must recognize and embrace that confronting North Korea on its horrendous human rights abuses is essential to securing very fiable commitments from the, the Kim regime and appointing the values of our nation. So I will continue to speak out and I look forward to continuing to work with you on all of these important issues. Thank you. It's much, much appreciated. The, and I was very glad to hear you reiterate the, the importance you're attaching to having a special envoy in that role that Congress created well over a decade ago, and we've just been infy now for several years. And then working with that person and with Congress closely on these issues, I mean, I think, you know, the Korean American community is only going to play a larger role, I think, and rightly so in the unfinished business of the Korean Peninsula, because it certainly is about division and nuclear weapons and security threats, but it's also about about human tragedy. And I know that's still very deeply felt in the Korean American community and something we want to not only not forget, but really find ways to address. So thank you for that advice and that encouragement. I am so grateful to you for your time and for this conversation. I hope we can continue it maybe in person next time. Yes, but please, like, thank you so much for coming. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much.",

        "transcript": " Because he's as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as long as I used to. But I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. President Biden in the swing state of North Carolina today, rallying supporters after last night's debate, where his performance has made some Democrats fearful about prospects in November. Last night, California Congressman Robert Garcia was with the president ahead of the debate, and also worked the spin room after the debate, alongside Governor Gavin Newsom here in California. Congresswoman or Congressmen, Robert Garcia, represents Long Beach. He joins us now right now. Thank you so much for being here. So going into the debate, a lot of Democrats and Independents were looking for reassurance on the issue of President Biden's age. They wanted to see that he was strong and fit and ready to campaign. Do you feel better about those issues? Do you think voters feel better about those issues after last night? I mean, look, I have felt confident in President Biden this entire time. And I think that he should be judged like anyone by the entire record. We've seen him as president now for over three years. We've seen him at campaign rallies. We've seen him at the White House. And yes, we've seen him, of course, at the debate. And like he said, I sure I would have preferred his voice, not to be raspy throughout the evening. But he today came out super strong in North Carolina and fired that crowd up. And so I have a lot of confidence in the President. And I think his record speaks for itself. It's about lowering health care costs, women's reproductive choice, investing in infrastructure, and quite frankly someone that's going to protect democracy. So I think there is a there is a choice here in the President's movie forward. And we're looking forward to that to the months ahead. But a big part of that is communicating that. If you really think that democracy is on the line, and there are some left-leaning voices who are coming out against President Biden right now, we want to put up some of them on the screen. Basically, most of the folks at the New York Times, Thomas Friedman, Nicholas Christoff, Frank Baruni, the opinion section, God help us. A lot of these folks saying that they like President Biden, that they're friends with President Biden, that they voted for President Biden, but that he should not continue. Do you think that of all the candidates in the entire country that Joe Biden, in his 80s, is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump? Absolutely. And you know why? Because Joe Biden is the only person in the entire country that has actually ever beaten Donald Trump in a presidential election. So he's done it once before, and he's going to do it again. And I think that is critically important. And you have somebody with the experience and the wisdom. And yes, we know he is older. He jokes about that himself. We know that he is someone with a lot of experience with also brings wisdom. But at the end of the day, it's going to be the record. And last night, yes, there was a lot we can debate a lot about the style of the candidates, and the style of Joe Biden's presentation, but the substance, and what he said, was solid. And today, he came out, again, in North Carolina, and I think knocked it out of the park. But a debate is, I mean, it's more than just the substance. The style does matter when you're in the process of communicating something. And four years ago, he looked like a different person on stage. And a big part of the job is being able to brush back what Donald Trump is saying. I mean, you do not think that if you had a younger nominee who could respond faster, who could do more rallies, who could do more interviews, who could put in more places, that that might be better for democracy. Well, look, I'm going to, I agree with our governor, with Governor Newsom. I mean, the best person to beat Donald Trump is Joe Biden, who's already done it once. And so I support the president. I mean, the party is going to be behind the president. I don't think that the New York Times is exactly, you know, a great representation of most of the, or the middle of America. And so at the end of the day, particularly not some of the columnists there. But so at the end of the day, we're going to have a binary choice. And let's remember who Donald Trump is. I mean, Donald Trump, in my opinion, and I think in most of Americans' opinions, is someone who let an instruction against the Capitol. He, they convicted criminal. He attacks immigrants. He does not support a national right to reproductive health care in this country. And so that is the choice that will be in front of voters. There are many months still until the election. There will be another debate. And sure, I think everyone, including Joe Biden himself, who has mentioned it, would have preferred him not to have that Raspi voice in the debate. But we've moved on from that. And I think that if you look at even some of the kind of quick polling of undecided voters in certain states, I mean, I think Joe Biden did fine. And we're going to move forward. And we're going to win the election in November. All right. We will see in the days and weeks ahead what happens in terms of the polling coming into the debate. Of course, he was behind in most swing states. We'll see if he pops up ahead in the days ahead. And real, real quickly, what was it like being in that spin room? I mean, look, the energy, of course, was incredible. I mean, I think obviously just to be there, supporting representing the president, the proud to be there with our governor, the two Californians there. We spent a lot of time together yesterday in behind the scenes and the now in the spin room. And I think we're all really proud of him as well. All right. Congressman Robert Garcia, thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it.",

        "transcript": " I'm a finance refuelbastic. I'm a professor here at the Price School and I run the Bedroes and Center. I like to welcome you all to our lunch with a leader program. I see a number of familiar faces but there are some I think who may not have been to one of these before. So I want to say a little bit about the Bedroes and Center and then give you the ground rules for today and then we'll sort of get into it. So this is one of our programs of the Bedroes and Center for Governance. And the Center is really focused on issues associated with implementing policy. So there's a lot of work that's done by people in the field, the experts in the field, to try to set up systems in a way so that we set up the incentives right, we structure the programs right and we design the policy in the best way possible. But that's only half the story and half the deal. And once it's designed it actually has to be executed. And too often when policies fail, it's on the execution side and not the design side. So what we're trying to do with this center is lift up issues around how to execute and implement policy, ranging from the politics of getting it enacted all the way through to the management, the leadership, the vision and the delivery on the ground. And as part of that, we do this in three ways. We promote research. So there we have a number of faculty members here who do some leading research. We try to lift up that stuff so that people know the latest in terms of management and how to implement policy. And we have a training program. So we actually train people who are practitioners in the field. And we do this both here in California and overseas around across the globe. So we really are trying to project that. And the third thing we do is try to get people to think about governance issues on a regular basis. And that's through the events that we have here on campus and some of the things that we have on the web. I hope you're all on our mailing list and you get our things and listen to our podcast. We have a book club now. And we do a bunch of things that I think are that we hope get you to think about governance on a regular basis and understand how important it is. And as we look at our communities to be mindful of the issues around governance and to focus on, I'm going to be willing to invest and have that happen. In terms of events, this is a lunch with the leader event. We design this specifically and purposefully to be intimate, to be an opportunity for all of you to really talk with the person who is the guest for the day. And rather than just listen to the person talk and then have three or four questions as you wish you asked and knew you would never get a chance to do. This is really structured for this to be your time. And so we don't really have an agenda. We don't have, you know, I've asked them, you're not to give a speech. And rather what I want to do is just do some quick introductions so everybody knows who's in the room. And then we open the floor up to talk about whatever it is you want to talk about. I'll be the moderator, but other than that, this is really your time. When thank you for being here. And maybe we could start with just a little bit about your background that you have to be super extended. But that's how did you get to where you are and give us a little sense of your journey? Well, first thank you all for coming for lunch. I appreciate the invitation. It's always good to be on campus. Start off by saying I'm a graduate of the Annabrik School here at SC. And so I did my graduate work there. And the new building is fantastic. As is the new price building. I've also had the great pleasure of teaching here part time. And for the last almost four years now, I've taught part time in a few courses at SoulPrice here and also at Annabrik. And so I've had the chance to come back and to be involved with a lot of the issues you're all involved with. And I think the faculty here just do a great job. I'm so proud that having been a graduate and seeing what the faculty are doing with the students are doing, the research. And so I have a very big, big place in my heart for USC as a, as a Trojan myself. Just to go, to go back, I was born in Lima, Peru. We have another Peruvian American here, Peruvian here. And I came to the US when I was five years old. So I came in a very typical immigrant experience, like a lot of immigrants that arrived to the US when they're young. I came here with eight other members of my family. We all arrived and kind of bounced around most of my childhood. We went from Norwalk to Downey to Los Angeles to parts of the San Gabriel Valley and just kind of went where, you know, we're family found work or whatever was convenient for, for the house. Well, that's the time for the house. Well, that's the time during that time and that really was all through, through the point where I graduated high school. We were a family that relied a lot on each other. We didn't have very much. We certainly classify ourselves as a, you know, a low income immigrant family. But we're very strong, well, committed to, you know, to kind of work in hard. And I always say that my mom is very typical of that kind of immigrant woman that wants, that brought us here for a better life or a family. And so she and my grandmother did a great job, I think, of just keeping the family together and kind of in tough times. But we never felt growing up. I never felt growing up like I had less than everybody else, even though I did. It was a really great, great family to be in. Growing up and what brought me to Long Beach, it's kind of an interesting story is, you're never growing up expect that you're going to go to college or expect what your life's going to be like. And when we all came over, English was all of our second languages. So we were Spanish speaking. That was what we knew. And then we just began to learn, learn the language. And when I was in high school, and I became more aware of kind of what my surroundings, we would almost three or four times every summer throughout high school, middle school and parts of growing up. We would come to a beach in Long Beach called Mother's Beach. A few that are from Long Beach or from middle with Mother's Beach, it's a really small beach in Long Beach. Without, you know, it's kind of small for kids. And so we would go there and on the way to Mother's Beach, my mother who didn't try to keep telling me you're going to go to college, you're going to get an education. Because knowing my family had much more than a middle school education, the only way to get to Mother's Beach off the freeway from a layer of the Tangaro Valley from the 605 was to pass by Cal State Long Beach. And we'd pass by Cal State Long Beach and my mom would literally say, hey, you're going to she'd point out and say, you're going to go to college. That's a college, that's a university, you're going to go to university. So when it was time for me to apply to college, I literally applied to one school. I applied to Cal State Long Beach. Because that's all I knew. I just figured that was my college, what I knew of what college was. And I ended up at Cal State Long Beach. We, you know, we was fortunate enough to live, I live in the dorms. And we just had a great experience. And for me getting to college, while I got to college, was around the same time I also became a US citizen. So those were two very, those for me were the two kind of defining moments of my life, being at this place that kind of opened my eyes to the rest of the world. And then becoming, I finally felt like a full participant in my community. I felt like I had the ability. I was as American, as I could be as involved as any of my classmates or friends. It really made me feel, give me a lot of confidence to be quite frank. And while I was in college, I explored, I think I grew up really quickly. And then I really got focused on education. I gained a couple really strong faculty mentors. And I'll say that if not for those two faculty mentors as an undergrad, I would not have kind of pursued leadership or challenged myself. And I was fortunate that I had a faculty that challenged me and that always told me, you know what, you can go to graduate school or you can get involved in leadership. You can do, you can do more than what you're doing. And that's when I made the decision when I was in college. I had done some leadership stuff, but not anything big. I actually ended up running for student body president to be honest, partly on a joke as, as my friends said you should run. I said, oh, I'll run, but I didn't expect to win. And then I won. And then so I thought that was my first very small taste. I was elected student body president at Cal State Long Beach. By then I had knew I want to go to graduate school. I left the campus. I came to USC about two years later to Annemburg for the graduate program there, which ended up meeting a French for life and people that I'll never, I'll never lose touch with. And then I immediately after graduate school began teaching part time, I speak full time in high school. And then I taught part time at Cal State Long Beach in Long Beach City College. And that's when everything became I got involved in education. I started teaching more. I began to I got a full time job in the administration at Long Beach City College. I got invited back to come to cheer at Annemburg first. Then I started teaching part time at Seoul. And while that started happening, I got really involved in the city. This was now probably about eight or nine years ago. I ended up becoming president of my neighborhood association because quite frankly, you I bought a home for the first time. And the first thing you realize you, you know, you buy a home, you start looking around, I have an investment. What am I going to make my investment better. And that's how it really starts. And I started getting all my neighborhood ran for the city council. I got elected to the city council. And then if I rewind a set a year ago, I was in my I was serving just my first term on the city council. And my plan was always just to run for a second term. And our mayor decided kind of at the last minute not to run for a last third term, which he was initially going to run for. And so he made the decision to not run. And I decided the next day that I would run. And I wasn't the favorite to win. I don't think. I think the favorite to win was a sitting member of the state legislature, who was her and her and her family had 123 straight elections. So they're a family. So it's she was in the legislature. Her ex hub was in Congress representing Long Beach. Her son and law was a judge. And her daughter in law was on the city council. And the family had won 23 elections never lost. So everyone had told me at the time, well, you're not going to win. You know, you're too young and everything else that you hear. And so I ran. I made it into the top two. She ended up placing third. And, you know, four or five months, four or five months ago, I got elected mayor. And now I've been mayor for about a little over 100 days. And I'm 36 years old. I have I have an EDD in education. I initially thought I would be a quite I was on the track initially where I really wanted to be an education. Not just an administrator, but I wanted to explore how education impacts, particularly communities that have access to graduate education, which is what I was interested in. And I still am. And I always say, whenever this is all done, I'm going to go back to a college and, you know, and enjoy myself. But here we are. And so a mayor of Long Beach, Long Beach is the 32nd largest city in the country. The largest seaport complex in the United States. It has, you know, obviously home to Cal State Long Beach, which is the number one applied to Cal State in the state of California, which is great for the we have the system office for the California State University there. It's a second largest city in the county. It's one of the most diverse populations in the country. It's a great place full of neighborhoods, all sorts of people, huge coastline and really proud of it. Long Beach is I've lived there for 20 years. And and that's that's the story. Well, that's quite a story. You know, I've not really heard the accidental council member, the accidental mayor. It wasn't totally accidental. I didn't think it was really that accidental. And then you actually gave a shout out to faculty, which rarely happens in these things. So I appreciate that. So lots of ways we can go, but let's just open this up and folks have questions. Okay. Hi. Thank you so much for sharing this really touching your story. So now that you're a very young me, I'm sure that you have had a lot of experiences working with people of different ages, different temperaments. So in the last 100 years, what two or three lessons have we gained as a leader managing people of these different backgrounds? Well, I think, you know, one thing that one thing that I learned kind of growing up is I was always different. So I'm gay. I'm openly and I've been obviously that's something that I struggled with when I was younger. I was an immigrant. I remember when I was particularly in the fourth or fifth grade and I was trying to really master English. I remember I had a very thick accent. And that was very difficult for me because I would get teased for having this, this, I didn't think it was an accent. I think everyone in my family talked. But I remember forcing myself to try to overcome that, you know. And that experience kind of taught me to celebrate diversity and just, I think, I think differences is what makes everything great. So when people are come from different points of view, even a point of view politically that I might disagree with, I always welcome that. You know, I, I, I think that work, the, what, working with different types of opinions, I think they're really good thing. I think it makes democracy stronger. I think that it's good to have debate. It's good to have different points of view. And I, I always welcome that. And so I think that sometimes we try to make everything the same and expect people or we want to hear things that we enforce our beliefs. And I usually like the opposite of that. So I want to, I think I'm going to sharpen his question a little bit. You're a young guy, right? You come into a major city. All the division directors are older than you are. They all have more experience than you. And here you come waltzing in. Yeah, did you got any pushback? Do people like look at you and say, yeah, I hear what you're saying, but you don't really know what you're talking about. Like, has that happened at all? And if, if it hasn't, you know, why not? Because that would be the natural course of things I would think. I think that's, yeah, I think, well, there's a couple things. I think one, one of the great things about getting a complete education and a graduate education is that as, as you move forward, you have a certain level of knowledge of the way things work. And I think that regardless of your age, going to graduate school or getting an education at a great university, being involved in research or being involved in gaining knowledge gives you a, a, a base level of information that you can use regardless of age. So I always felt like I could have a intellectual discussion or have a debate based on facts and knowledge because I love to consume information, even, you know, even at, whatever, you know, at 36, I feel like I know a lot about a lot of things because I try to consume, I read, I get information. And so that gives, I think that gives you a certain level of confidence. But absolutely, I mean, I'll tell you that being when I was, when I was running, it's difficult. I mean, I, when I ran in the fields for mayor, I was by far the youngest. In fact, I mean, I was probably the youngest by, you know, 20 years. And so when you, when you look at, actually that's not true. There's one other, one other guy that was maybe four or five years older than I am, but, but majority of the rest of the folks were, were older. And so when you, you deal with that all the time, I would get all the time, all you're too young or you don't have enough experience or, and the media would cover me as like kind of the younger candidate sometimes. I think what helped was that I had a strong education. I used a lot. I actually tried to use that to as an advantage. So I would, I would try to focus on the fact that I had, you know, that I had a graduate experience that I had, you know, taught that I had started a small business that I had been, you know, had a lot of experience as a city council member. But then I try to use it as an advantage. So I thought, well, they're going to use it against me, which they, which they did. But then I try to flip it. So what does someone at 36 bring? It's different. Yeah. Okay. So I'm now the, you know, in the youngest mayor that cities ever had. But what are the benefits? And I would talk to people. I can, I can talk about creating a government of the future. What are the 21st century government look like? How do we communicate in new ways using, you know, social media and other tools? And how do we energize young people to get involved? The next generation of leaders. And so I tried to do that. But I have had moments both of those accounts and I'm a campaign where I even had meetings. I remember one particular, I had a breakfast meeting where someone thought I was the waiter and they were meeting me for lunch. And that's happened to me oftentimes. They come up to you and they're like, oh, you know, can I take my order? And I said, oh, I said, you know, I'm Robert Garcia. I'm here to meet you. I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry. So I, you know, I get that all I get that. And that's okay. But you just kind of get used to it. You know, you get used to it. I, you just, it's part of, it's been in my DNA for a long time. And I think that we shouldn't regard people regardless of their age and be, shouldn't, that's not a good reason for me. So, so just as a, as a point for everyone, do not ask random people, will they take your order? Just, just let them ask, can I take your order for it? And that's happened to me multiple times in my life, by the way. So I'm sure it has a lot of people. Other questions? Yes. So I'd like to hear your position on minimum wage. There can't be in across the country now to raise minimum wage and election results last week. You know, in various areas across the country voted to raise minimum wage. And I just like to hear what your position on that is and any potential policy. Sure. I have Councilor Mungo over here. She's like, what is your position? So, let me, let me, let me tell you. So one, I, I was reading something the other day, which I think is, is, is so telling that, you know, 50 years ago, the largest, America's largest job, job producer was GM. And the average, the average wage at GM was $50 an hour. Today our largest producer of jobs is Walmart. And the national average wage is $8. So I think when you look, that statistic in itself is, should, should cause heartburn to anyone, regardless of politically where people are at. And when I was on the council, I supported a ballot measure to raise the living wage for hotel and convention center and airport kind of the tourism and travel industry folks. I supported a living wage that was on the ballot. And I also voted for it at the city council. And so from a, a policy point of view, I do support when, when you're able to raise a wage in a reasonable wage. So, in a reasonable, unresponsible way that won't, that won't be a detriment to the economy that you're working in. I think it's, I think you should absolutely make that decision. Is the minimum wage today in the country, the federal minimum wage, too low, absolutely. Should the wage even be higher in the state of California, I believe it should. I know that it's going up over the next few years. And to, to the larger point, right now there's a movement in Los Angeles and a lot of other cities to raise the minimum wage. In some cases, there's a discussion to raise it to $15. Mayor Garcetti has proposed to raise it to $13.25 over three years. Other cities, Pasadena, Santa Monica, Glendale, a few others are right now debating whether or not to raise the minimum wage and what it should be raised to. So, in the middle of $15, Germantusco, I think $15, I think San Diego went to $15. So, it's happening, what's happening is cities are now taking on that challenge. So, back to Long Beach. Right now, my position has been, you know, I've been mayor for 100 days. Do I, do I think that there's an opportunity for us to have a discussion sometime in the next year or two about what the minimum wage should be in Long Beach? Absolutely. Do I personally think that the minimum wage should be higher? I do. Is that something that is at the top of the agenda, that the council and I are discussing it's not. And the reason is because we have three or four or five really big issues that we're dealing with right now. But, I'll tell you this, and is if Los Angeles increases at 1325 or more and all the other cities in LA County do and the county, the board of supervisors is also debating whether they're going to do a minimum wage increase in different parts of an incorporated areas as well. So, what I think will be, what I think is not beneficial to Long Beach is to be this large, second largest city in a county where wages have been, have risen everywhere else and then we become this poverty pocket where our wages are not where other wages are in the area. That is a honest discussion that we're going to have to have in Long Beach. We're not having it right now. I don't expect we're going to have it any time in the next few months or in your future, but we will have it. With that, I think it's important to note that Long Beach, like a lot of cities, we have a poverty issue that's real. We have 20% one in five of our residents are living in poverty or at the poverty line. And they're having to make real tough choices about what to do. And so, it is giving someone an increase in wage always the answer, it's not. Does it sometimes hurt small businesses? Absolutely. Does it cause some businesses to close? It does. I mean, this is all, these are all facts, you know. And so, when you have the way increases to the wage, you have to weigh the economic impacts. And so, what we're trying to do first is put together a comprehensive economic development plan for the city that looks at education, that looks like technology and innovation, that looks at maximizing healthcare service and what we have to see what we can do to work with. To see what we can do to address the poverty rate, because we know the wage issue is a much bigger debate that will happen. If you wouldn't help with this, you should definitely give us a call. Okay. People in our building would be very pleased to weigh in. Dr. Garcia, I understand you owe into news organization in 2000 and you also remember that in every faculty, so I'd be curious to know what the impacts of communications and the media and the participants of the media have been in terms of your governing style. Huge influence. So, when I went to, when I was a graduate student here, I became fascinated when I was in Annabberg with hyperlocal news. And the way that kind of hyperlocal news outlets were kind of changing the way news is being reported and the way people get information, how, at the time, how new technology was changing the way people consume the news. Whether it's now on your Twitter feed or whether you're getting it from a smaller news source and not the traditional paper every day. So, I got interested in that and so a friend and I started a small business, which was a hyperlocal news website called The Long Beach Post. Today, it's a very successful business in Long Beach. I have, I dispose of kind of my shares of the company before I was installed as mayor because I thought it would be odd to be mayor and to have a, you know, control the press. And it's one of the kind of top news producers of content in the city. And so, it's got something to, I think it has something close to 50,000 kind of online subscribers and is really well read. And so, but creating that, that, that business and to be very honest, my business partner is really the one that created and that really is a one that really developed it. I was providing kind of articles and why I was half of the, of the team, he really, is the one that built that organization. And so, and he ran it. He passed away, like two years ago in a pretty tragic car accident. And so that's kind of when I begin to vesting myself of it because I really couldn't do it. But what I learned is that you have to use every channel of communication available to communicate to the public. And you cannot just rely on traditional sources of communication. You cannot just rely on just the news covering things and then, and then, and then people, assuming that people are going to get all the information from, from the newspaper, because they're not. I mean, I, I, I communicate extensively through social media. I think it's a very powerful tool. I get as many people that send me Facebook messages that I do oftentimes like emails to my office. Because people just view that connection, whether it's through Twitter or whether it's through, I have a pretty good network of folks that I, that I communicate with. And so I think you have to create your own ways of communicating. And I think that, that's the question about, about age, I think that being having kind of grown up in that change in the digital environment has helped me greatly. The, the piece of your story that resonated with me was how you started off as head of your neighborhood association. And I think actually one of Long Beach's strengths, we have a lot of really active people in the community. I live in the big spinels area, and the flares, we're right in my neighborhood. And I think what I see in my neighborhood is economic development, opportunity really coming from the community. And so now, as, as a policy maker on larger level, how do you see really implementing that on a more sort of formal basis, sort of empowering local residents to, to sort of support their activities in their communities? You said economic development, is that what you said? Well, I can now do a sort of general activities opportunities within the city. Well, I think, you know, there's like a macro and macro way of looking at obviously at economic development. But I think that what we're trying to do is come up with right now, a long-term view of what economic development is going to look like in Long Beach. You know, Stacey, who's at the end over there, is one of our nine, one of the nine council members that we have. And she also, what's interesting is, you know, the council went very young this year. In fact, I think the average age is, what's the average age on the council? It can take out one person, it's 36. Yeah, wow. And so it's never been like this before. It's great. I love it. Stacey's chair of our economic development and finance committee. And one of the things that we're trying to do right now is come up with this kind of new kind of tenure plan for what economic development will look like in Long Beach. And we are putting together, I'm kind of be appointing kind of an all-star 11 member commission to look at that. That commission and group actually tonight at the city council meeting, the council will be voting to restructure that commission so that we can do the things that I'm talking about. So I need your vote on that, Stacey. So from there, that commission will then work with Stacey's committee and develop and present to the full city council a kind of tenure roadmap for economic development that is going to do a few things. One is talk about those kind of macro issues like the new economy. How is healthcare changing the way we do business in the city? What's the future of transportation look like at the port of Long Beach? How is technology changing or work spaces, those types of issues? But then hopefully also talk about the strength of our business quarters. Like Bixby Nolts is a massive success story. How did that happen? Because it was city investment, but also because it was great people like the Blair Cones and the business groups and neighborhood association. They are doing some of that grassroots work to make the neighborhood strong. So we're hopeful that right now our plan is to develop that sometime in the first quarter of 2015, that plan that we presented at the council, the council will adopt it, and then we'll begin implementation. We've restructured also in my proposed budget this year. I recreated a new bureau, which is the new economic development and property management bureau for the city of Long Beach, which will help guide this plan as well. So can I ask you? I will ask this differently because you later sound like it says I'm a big happy family and all the neighborhood associations get together and we all just want to do the same thing. When you're running a neighborhood association, you definitely have views and the notion of self-determination and all that. But now you're the mayor, right? And you have, I don't know how many neighborhood associations there are in Long Beach. There's a lot. I would imagine. And they are all going to want to push back against what you want to do per se. How do you manage that? How are you navigating that? I know it's only been a hundred days. So we're still learning our relationships. But that's got to be something that's a challenge and ongoing struggle. That's a great question. Let me first say that one of the things I'm so thankful for in retrospect, even though it was terrible, when I was going through it, is that a tough campaign makes you a tougher mayor. And my skin is so thick because I went through 10 months of hell. And particularly the last four months, three months of that campaign, I was waking up with my partner and turning on the TV and seeing commercials about how horrible the person I was. Receiving mail into my mailbox every day saying that Robert Garcia is unethical or he's mismanaging taxpayer money or he didn't have the experience. Whatever it was, the campaign that I just finished as mayor was the most expensive race for mayor we've had. Tons of outside interest money. My opponent was a self-funded millionaire. So he spent of his own money about $900,000 on top of what he raised. So I was out in the final election. I was outspent probably two to one. Fortunately the outside groups came in and supplemented that for both sides. But when you go to this really tough campaign where it's really a knife fight, I mean it is a life or death. Every day you're getting attacked, you're getting hit. People are saying horrible things about you, you're reading horrible things about yourself in the newspaper. People are talking about you like they know you and you're like, what is happening to my, your life almost is lived. Like you're watching this caricature of yourself and it's not really you. And you're doing the same thing by the way. I attacked him and hit him back as much as he was attacking me because unfortunately that's what politics is. That experience today I am so immune to letting things that would normally bother me, bother me anymore. And I think that an important rule for me of governance is if you're in this business to make everyone happy you're in the wrong business. This is not the make everyone happy business. This is the hopefully you have listened to the community. You have your own core set of values and ideals and then you're going to I was elected to implement those. And I'm going to stand up for those and you know some really good advice I got from a former political friend was the most popular day. The day that you're the most popular as an elected official is your first day in office. And then you're going to start making decisions and not and people aren't going to love every decision you make but that's okay. I love you know there's a lot of quotes about those that make the big differences in life or those that fought for what they believe then. And weren't always the most popular or weren't always but you know but did the right thing. And so I hope that I can I know what my personal beliefs are and I don't mind ruffling feathers now when I read something you know that someone said negative about me. I absorb it. I try to learn from it but it doesn't really bother me look at you to bother me. It just is is what it is. Now oftentimes read like and my partner always says why are you reading the comments sections of these things. And I don't know I'm just sort of kept reading them. Yeah and I'll be reading these things and I hear these people have conversations about me or something I'm doing and I'm going you know they've never met these folks and they're just talking about how violent I am. You just have to sit back and go you know that's just it is what it is. And so you just kind of develop brush off. That's very zen. I'm at a good place with that now. Alright yes. Glad to hear that. When you're talking about the minimum wage you mentioned that there are a few things that were sort of higher up on the priority list right now. Some of the biggest issues along with just facing. It's wondering what those issues are and also how you determine when one is a priority and gets to the top of the list. Well I think it's important that I kind of deliver on the things that like I campaigned on first and foremost. And so I the major things for me are and I talked about one one is economic development. You know our our port is the largest provider of jobs 30,000 direct jobs hundreds of thousands of indirect jobs you think about regionally what trade and what it's doing. So to focus and ensure the port is strong that we're growing that infrastructure is in place. That trade is stable is for us job number one when it comes to economic development. So I got to make sure that are that were that were the jobs are stable. Large industries are are are being are being good stewards of those jobs and have good relationship with their employees and all that piece is important. Secondly I have a huge education agenda which has really been my priority since I've been in office. There's three things that I want to achieve as mayor and I take this from my experience. You know teaching in the classroom being an administrator at a college knowing how important it is. I'm a big believer that the single most important thing you can do to strengthen your economy is to invest in education. There is no better investment of a public dollar that's invested a public dollar in the classroom and into the education system. I'm 100% convinced of that all the research I believe points points to that and for me I look at that in three ones. One is I want universal preschool for all want for all long Beach eligible preschoolers. Cities are doing it across the country. The education research is pretty clear about the impacts that a pre-K education have on the ability of that young student to be able to get in and succeed in college and then graduate and become a productive member of society. So we can get universal pre-K I believe in long Beach it would be one of the single most important things we can do to strengthen the future of the city is to ensure that there's an equal place where all youngsters have access. In Long Beach the families with the least access to preschool are also the families that need at the most. So we have families that have the lowest level of income, the least amount of education, the ones that need to work that can't because they have a youngster, whether it's a three year old or four year old, that needs some type of child care education system that they can't afford. So the universal pre-K Seattle just passed the universal pre-K program this last election. New York has done it. San Francisco has done it. There's 10 or 15 cities that have done it the right way. We're going to do it the right way in Long Beach on pre-K. The second thing on education that's been important is the issue of link learning and internships. So the city of Boston, their public school system has 50,000 public school students and the 50,000 public school students in Boston, 15,000 of them have internships. Long Beach has 80,000 public school students, 1500 of them have internships. 1500, 80,000, 15,000 to 50,000. So we have, and this is no different than Los Angeles, by the way, very small numbers of link learning and internship opportunities for particularly juniors and seniors in high school. Why is that critical? It's critical because we know that if a young person has an internship, the chances of them being hired by that company or that nonprofit is higher than if they were just a cold applying. So a lot of companies will hire interns that work for them. And we also know that the students that have the hardest time getting hired are oftentimes also from low-income communities and they need that foot in the door. So if my goal is to double our amount of internships in the first year, we've almost already done that just by asking a few large corporations in the city of Long Beach to do it. If the city of Long Beach is 400 internships a year, I've asked this to double that to 800. That's an easy ask. Now we're almost there. We only have 1500, we're getting there. And so internships is another important piece. And just whatever the mayor can do in my role to strengthen college completion, to strengthen access to college, I will do. What I don't believe in is I don't believe in cities trying to control education systems. That experiment has happened many times including here in Los Angeles and it does not work. And cities try to control universities, school districts. I think that's a huge mistake. I think that cities should collaborate. Cities should provide support. But school systems should be driven by teachers, by parents, and by the administrators. So we're going to do whatever we can. So it's been education, economic development, and then some technology stuff. So just on this, it was almost like, did you read our website in advance? So we had a conference last spring called Innovating to End Urban Poverty. And we asked a bunch of experts from around the country to what things would be most important to move the dial on poverty. And when we asked people what one thing would they do? It was universal pre-kindergarten. Because the data show that the disparities between those who are in poverty and those who are not are large at first grade. And that gap never closes as you go forward. So when you get to high school or at the end of high school, you're way behind. And so you're not as competitive in your possibility to get wages. That thing would be out of poverty or much lower. So this is actually a really important thing. So I hope you succeed. And we'll definitely be keeping an eye on that. So that's quite interesting. The link learning is actually important too. The alternate path ways to employment that college need not be the only way. There are other ways to do it. And that's important to give people options. All right. Another question. Yes. So my question is how is your gay identity having impact on your election and job? Is that an active image making you look evil or something? Or positive? Like you are diverse and open-minded or neutral like nobody throws it up. Nobody cares and just treat you like strict people as well. And second question if allowed. I'm wondering. So how the Long Beach mayor and council set up the policy on agenda? Like which issues do you think are more important than others? Especially in renewable energy policy? Like do you think is there a goal to comply with state policy or you plan to do more? Thank you. So on the first question about has being gay, how that affected my election or being mayor? I think that I was more worried about it the first time I ran for office when I ran for city council. I was out already. I came out in college. But I never made an issue. Like I was out. Everyone knew I was reported in the press. But it's something that was, I mean for me being gay is, you know, I'm Latino. I'm gay. I live in downtown Long Beach. There's a lot of things about me that make me me. So I've worried about it more in the first election. In the second election of a mayor, I wish I could say that it didn't have any sort of impact because I mean there are a few occasions where I would knock on someone's door and like they wouldn't like someone or I met someone and like they wouldn't shake my hand or. I had a few messages or letters where people would say I would never support you because of your lifestyle or whatever things like that. So there were instances but I don't know that it made a difference. I think that that was like the extreme minority. I have no obviously data that proves if it hurt me or helped me, I don't really know. Long Beach, I would say generally is a more progressive city than most. I think there's a larger LGBT population than in most cities. So I think that that I was very, I had a big support group. In Long Beach, it wouldn't fly for an elected official to say something negative about the gay community. It just wouldn't be acceptable. So I think I was very supported. If anything, I think it helped me consolidate the strong LGBT vote and base. So I think that helped me a lot. But I don't know. So whether it hurt me more, to be honest, I think that the way the election went. Sometimes you have to strategize on who your base is and in my election my larger base, what I was trying to consolidate was progressives, the traditional kind of like Latino vote, LGBT and younger folks. That's what kind of I focused on. And so I figured that maybe if there was a stronger social conservative vote out there, they probably weren't going to vote for me anyways. Regardless of if I was gay or not gay, because they probably didn't like the fact that I was maybe more progressive. And so I kind of felt like that group didn't really matter because I wasn't going to get to vote anyways. The second energy policy. Yeah, just I'll just say a real real briefly that on energy in general, I'm a big believer in this at a speech last week that if cities don't get on the ball, like immediately on the issue of climate change and what's it and what it's going to do to our cities, then we're going to be in big trouble in the future. Look at all the scientific data. What cities are going to be affected are coastal cities. Long Beach is one of them. We have to change the way we're doing energy consumption. So next year, I'm going to be working with we have an aquarium and Long Beach Aquarium Pacific of very great institution. We're going to be bringing together some some scholars, the Aquarium Pacific and others to put together a really strong climate change action plan for the city, which we don't have, which you really need. So we've got to we've got to look at how our emissions, how what we can expect with the next 20, 30 years, you're going to look like for the city with climate change. And then look about the ways that we consume energy and the way we can do a better job of doing it. So you should definitely reach out to the federal government. There are folks in the EPA, even at HUD, who have some models to help communities work through these things. I worked with a little of that stuff. But particularly for coastal communities, it's really important that you have sort of an emergency plan so that you're prepared and understand sort of what assets are at risk. Any event that things happen. So definitely it's important. Other questions? I've won over here and I'll get you to. I've been working on a project in the Annabberg School called Open Data LA. We're working at the Open Data efforts throughout the LA County. And Long Beach has it really done that you're talking about them technology, stopping our priority and 21st century city. But we've noticed that Long Beach is big. It is hasn't quite kept up with some of the smaller cities, including Santa Monica and Culver City. Is there anything in particular you're going to do about that is a chief data officer position, something you see in the foreseeable future. Yes and yes. First of all, we are greatly behind when it comes to Open Data. And it's just not with part of the culture of the city. And I'm a huge believer in that. And I think that I'm not, you know, it's just the world, it's just the future that we live in. We've got to be open to information and to, for the information to be developed and massaged and, and look that. And so I think you're going to see a big change in Long Beach when it comes to Open Data. It's already beginning to happen. I think everyone at the city kind of knew when I was coming in as mayor that those are the kind of things that were important to me. So everyone knew that I was like the technology guy that I like all this kind of stuff, the new cities kind of two, you know, three point of stuff. It's really important to me. So you're going to see a big change in Long Beach on Open Data stuff. I'm a big, the reason why I restructured our technology department is for that exact reason. So we went from in this last budget. We used to have what was called the technology services department. And it's now called the Department of Technology and Innovation. We're going to be hiring a chief innovation officer in that department as well. I'd love to have a data officer. I think what LA is doing some amazing things I spent maybe about a month ago. I went to the city lab conference that was here in LA, which was all about Open Data and the future of cities and how cities are changing that the Bloomberg Foundation puts on. And we're actively competing for large innovation grants right now through the Bloomberg Foundation and others to do some of this Open Data work. But we think even if we're not successful in some of the larger grants, we're going to internally get it done. And listen, if you want to help us and there's people here, we're going to... We're helping already. Yeah, well, no Long Beach. If you want to help us. No, we are. Andrew Schrock, who's a PhD at the Bloomberg School is one of your residents and he's doing a great job. In Long Beach? Yeah, in Long Beach. He's got to reach out to us. Let me just drop one name who's been working in your city who's been helping us. Her name is Rachel Tanner and she's at the city manager's office and she's just done a great job helping. Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that. She's great. She's great. John, you know Rachel. Yeah, she's great. Okay, good to know. All right. You've been waiting for a while. Oh, yeah. My question is more about when you were giving your introduction, you talked about mentors in your undergraduate graduate school. It's really important to be getting you where you are today. And I just wondered if you still rely on mentors in your current position and how they... If so, how did it help you lead? Is that something that you still... Absolutely. I have a mentor, a faculty mentor of mine from my undergrad. His name is Dr. Craig Smith. He is still my mentor to this day. And I mean, he was in my office last week. He is a scholar of first amendment studies and is... My opinion is one of the most brilliant men I've ever met. And what I like about him is that he's always been a very kind of honest, really kind of straightforward person on any issue that I might bring to him. And he helped me kind of develop a lot of my messaging over the years politically. He's been... He's been a long history of being involved in politics. He's been great. He's still as a mentor to this day. I would say that my mother is a mentor of mine. She continues to be a mentor of mine. I get her advice all the time. I think she gives me great advice, actually. And so I have a few of those. So I have a few mentors that... There's another faculty member that's been a real strong mentor of mine. And I just try to keep gaining their wisdom as much as possible. So two questions come to mind on this one. How did these mentorships come about? Right? So did you take someone's class and then did you bug professors Smith relentlessly after you were done so that you just started talking on a regular basis? Did he reach out to you and send you in on how did that happen? And then I was wondering about the notion of a kitchen cabinet. Do you have a small number of people who you just call informally to get that input because a lot of times you're in the big chair now. There can be a bubble around that in a lot of ways. So how do you stay grounded? But I want to start with the mentor thing because that's actually something that I think is important for the folks here. So for me it was out of necessity. So when I was in college I didn't have a support system. So my family was always working. My mom always worked two jobs. And so my mom could give me good advice but I didn't have a support system. So when I was in college I looked to the faculty members as my support system. And so in Dr. Smith's case he was a faculty I had him in class. I loved what he had to say. And I just would be a kind of past and stay after class or go to his office hours and try to get more information. And then over time I just I became a mentee of his. I didn't have him in class but he just continued to mentor me. And that was I always had this kind of attraction to faculty that were in the classroom that were kind of imparting their wisdom or their information. And so I was always attracted to faculty members and I would connect with them and try to gain information from them and they always knew more than I did. So I like that. And that's kind of how I kind of sought it out. And then the second part of your question was do I have a kitchen cabinet? I don't have a formal kitchen cabinet. Sometimes I think I need one to be honest. And I kind of thought about like should I form one. I more have like people that I go to for advice. They're not part of a group but I have people that give me that give me good advice. I get good advice from one of my opponents who lost, didn't win but not the one that I was in the final. I would never get advice from him. But one of the other ones that is a long time. I always say that if I wasn't running he's the one I would have voted for. But you know he didn't make it to the primary but he's someone he headed up my transition team for example. And I get a lot of great advice city advice from him. There's a few people in the city that I go to for advice that I think have been around for a really long time. And I don't know all the answers and I don't know how to solve every problem with the city. And so I think you have to go out and get mentors and advice. But that sounds like a kitchen cabinet. So so most kitchen cabinets I think never actually meet. Yeah, I have a kitchen. They're just there around and they're in your sphere and you can reach out to them when you have questions. And it sounds like you've established that. I have but I do feel like I need more because what happens is and I think you're totally right. This is very different experience when I was on the city council. You immediately when you become mayor and there's just one of you. You this you this bubble immediately forms around you were no offense to my wonderful staff but they're they're always like trying to protect me right. And so they're I oftentimes feel like some of their job is to limit access to me because they want me to be able to focus on x y and z. And I really appreciate that but it makes you more isolated. And so it ends up happening as that you become you know now people don't email me directly and myself. My cell phone number is being changed and I have different emails and so my access to regular you know to people to me that that's a to just our community I feel like is more limited. And I haven't figured out yet how I'm going to deal with that yet because I'm not I'm feeling like I'm I'm in this I'm getting more of this bubble which in some cases is necessary for me to get work done. But my personality is not like my my staff hates that I like to respond to messages on my own on like on Facebook or that I like to take calls like they would rather me like not take my own media calls and I'm just used to that you know so I got a I haven't figured out yet completely. So the bubble is important so yeah because you know I've been in a smaller chair than yours and even in that context the appetite for your time is insatiable and there you can there are a multitude of people who want your voice and your opinion your presence and so you guys are doing a vital thing by by stopping that but but it but it it is a double and sort because you you can. Really lose touch if you're not careful but I don't think you're going to have that problem my guess is but the interesting question other questions I've been in I've been with my with my partner for six years he's actually a PhD student here at USC so he's finishing a dissertation political science and we didn't meet on campus but not that matters but he so he what's great. So the great is that he is a like true like academic and in political science so what what I love is that he thinks what I'm doing is not real politics so what he's doing what he's doing is is real politics you know is real political science which is you know research and all sorts of stuff. So what's what's been nice is he is this kind of if you were to meet him you would think while this guy is really quiet and kind of shy and which he which he gently publicly kind of is but he's also like the smartest person I know and so you know he he's here is on full fellowship he is he last year received the top at PhD prize for research for PhD student here at the university so he's brilliant political science mind he is probably my best political advisor and a lot of people don't really realize that and so he's been very supportive of me even though he hates talking to people you know so he he like has a very he has his friends and family and is very sweet and and great guy but I'm very thankful that we met before I was in office so we met before you were a council before was a councilman so we know we met when we were just you know just having fun and I was out at a club and he was there and we met and talked and you know it was with grad I was in grad school and he was looking at grad schools and then we just start and then you know a year later I was running for the city council and it just kind of happened I don't know that I could meet somebody now it would be very hard for me because I don't I wouldn't first know how to date anymore and then I just feel like I it's just very hard to you know I feel like our love is like a very genuine because it's like a very hard thing to do. It's started we kind of got to this place together which is really nice so the only thing that affect them in relation to difficultly was no one got more mad at the like attacks and he did so I hated seeing him get so upset about every every day it was like the commercials and the male and he hated getting the male and so he in the that really really bothered him rightly so you know I get it and then the first your first question was remind me was about I mean I don't know that I'm better suited for I just think that because of my age I'm a consumer also of like pop culture huge consumer of pop culture I watch reality TV I listen to hip hop I like to dance I know a lot about just you know popular culture and what's going on and so I think I can talk that out of the way I'm going to do it. I'm not a language if I need to and I can turn it I try to turn it off a lot as mayor but I'm as interested in like popular culture oftentimes I am in political stuff and I can consume a lot of that information and I think it's interesting and I watch real housewives of Atlanta I just saw it and I can have a conversation about that show just as much as I could have about like what's going on in Congress and that's just me so it helps me connect. I'm better grounded and I am so just on that have you did you when you became a council member did you start thinking more carefully about where you went and sort of what you were doing when you were out and we've had a number of people here who say you know Greg Smith is a who is a former councilman for the city said he would put on a tie and jacket to go to home depot because he knew he was going to run into people and so so the office changed. How he engaged the public are you living that at all or you just do what you do absolutely and the hardest thing for people I think particularly if you're if you're a gay in an office which a lot of people don't realize is for a lot of like gay men your social circle revolves around bars and where you go is there you're you end up going to a lot of like bars or LGBT restaurants or night clubs that's just part of a big part of. Kind of like the social circle you grow up and so for for me when you come out particularly when you're first coming out and then you're you you navigate and you tend to go to a lot of gay bars even something you want would drink all the time but that's just kind of where all your friends saying out there isn't like you know unless you're saying you know on occasions and we get coffee house or whatever else and so one thing I we got on the council and definitely now is all my friends like of you know my friend from college that are 35 36. They still all hang out at the bars that's where they hang out so if we're going to go do something or there's a birthday we're going to go to the drag bar or the whatever bar or and so. I've had to I've gone out to like bars with friends and I've had people walk up to me and tell me what are you doing here or people say why you at the bar like are you embarrassed to be here and it I had to really adjust my so I do less socially now. Then I probably ever have done even with friends because. Even though I don't really think there's a problem with it I think other people can perceive as a problem with me going to. Bars you know and having like a beer or a drink or something so I try to limit it as much as possible so it does affect you know I don't mind by the way. When I'm out I'm I'm very casual so I will actually go out in a hat and shorts and I know I shouldn't but. In my neighborhood I will oftentimes on the weekends I'm just in a baseball cap if I'm not having an event I'll just be in a baseball cap and you know a polo and and you know and shorts and people will stop me and they'll always say oh you're so casual what it'll say you know oh you're you know you're wearing a hat and I'm like yeah. So it's just as what it is. Other questions. Yes. You mentioned that you didn't have any intention of running for mayor and then mayor Foster decided not to run for a third term and you arrived at that decision within like 24 hours. Can you walk us through the. Sure and I should clarify it's not that when I when I was on the council I thought you know towards that end of that kind of first term I thought well I could run for mayor but I didn't had no intention of running for mayor. That time I thought maybe I mean I didn't know I thought maybe I'll run for mayor like after mayor Foster is done with this third term or maybe not maybe able to something else I wasn't really sure so it was that I had thought about it just not at that moment so what happened at that moment basically was I was I was a week before I a week or two weeks before I got the call from mayor Foster. He had asked me to chair his mayoral campaign to be head of his campaign as like the committee chair he had told me six months before that that he was going to run and likely to run and he was going to start you know but he was going to wait. He needed time he wanted to he needed more time and throughout the whole that whole six months I just assume I was going to run for real election. He on a few occasions like wavered on all we like well I'm pretty sure I'm going to run but then we always call me back and reinforce he was going to run and I just really believe it was going to he had done everything I thought he was very popular. He did a great job as mayor and I just wasn't really prepared I wasn't really at a like emotional or. Financial because it cost you a lot of money by the way you know you end up not working enough and I just wasn't ready but I knew that I knew when he called me he actually called me on a believe it like a Sunday night and I was on my way home from Palm Springs I had gone the Palm Springs with friends over the weekend I was coming home I had gotten home Sunday night and he called me and I was just shocked and he said I decided not to run for mayor and I remember the first thing I said to him I said what I said and I was I was actually kind of upset because I felt that he should have told me that like he was so certain of it he never once gave me any sort of room to start planning if maybe I would because I was a time I had been elected by smayer so I was on the council my colleagues had elected by smayer and so I thought okay so when he said I'm not doing it I knew with and the reason why I knew that I would do it is because I knew who all of you were running and it's nothing against them because they're really good people. But I just knew that like they weren't the right it was not the the the person that should be mayor was not in that group and um and so I just was very easy for me to decide I'm just going to do it and so I jumped in real quickly and he he literally said I'm not running in the next day I announced. And I ended up getting his support not not till towards the end of the campaign but he did end up supporting me and I think part of it was because I respected his time I didn't like jump ahead or or ever disrespect his his process um and then it was like a roller coaster I mean for basically was just like a rocket ship I'm from getting I'm running to having a raise you know 800,000 dollars uh and campaign and it was the it was horrible but great at the same time. So we'll have to end on that um because we're just about at a time but this has been fantastic I like to listen to you for another three hours and and the questions have been really really really interesting you have such a remarkable perspective on what has been a really remarkable experience in moving from a low income immigrant family to go into a college being the first one figuring out that you need implementers and then accidentally winning a council's seat in the mayorship and and yet having real perspective so you know just listen, you know I had a couple of takeaways that that that struck me the first was you started with your education and consuming information and knowledge and having that be the base for for how you engage with people and that that's interesting I I don't actually hear people say that as much as they should and I but I I think it's really important. And then a second thing is this communications issue, which we are seeing play out at every level of government and how we reach people. And I actually think for what we do in the hydrogen center circles, how do we engage people to participate, to be willing to have a voice, to learn to use their time, to be active and help us do things is really important. And so we're going to try to learn some lessons from you. The third one is, there was actually probably the same as the fourth one, but I'll say it to everybody, is you repeatedly had a good sense of what you needed and tried to do things to fill those voids. The mentorship you knew you didn't have the framework, the support system, so you went and created one. Just in even terms of talking with about the kitchen cabinet, you feel like you need more, you're going to figure out what to do about it. That's actually interesting. That's a sense of self and what you are and aren't that is really unusual, I think. And that's the fourth point, which is I just am amazed at how comfortable you are with who you are and really grounded in terms of what the world is and how we need to live in it. It's a level of maturity that is remarkable for old person and really super amazing for a young person. Thank you. Thank you again, this has been great. Before we clap for the mayor, I want to just encourage you to take the materials that we've left here with you. Stay in touch with us and we will have a number of these. I hope you found it interesting and I hope you come back. Mayor Garcia, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Please welcome California representative Robert Garcia. Thank you. Thank you. We all remember. We all remember the world in 2020. Where we were and for some of us who we lost. Now I was in my second term as mayor of Long Beach California. And my mom was a healthcare worker. Like many of you I watched in terror and horror as a COVID pandemic consumed our lives. As mayor I fought from her hospital beds for more tests and to make masks more accessible. What we needed at that moment was national leadership. But instead we got Donald Trump. While schools closed and dead bodies filled morgues, Donald Trump downplayed the virus. He told us to inject bleach into our bodies. He peddled conspiracy theories across the country. We lost hundreds of thousands of Americans and our economy collapsed. Now that summer of 2020 my mom and my stepfather both died of the COVID pandemic. And I miss them every single day. So when Donald Trump and his mega extremists like Margie Taylor Green downplayed the horror of the pandemic, it should make us all furious. Now I will never forget when Kamala Harris called me after my parents died. She told me about her own story, about losing her own mother and that she was praying for me at that very moment. Now we all know that later that year Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were elected president and vice president. And what a difference they made together. They got people vaccinated. They got the virus under control. They safely reopened our schools. And they passed the American Rescue Plan. A historic economic package that helped small businesses and created jobs all across the country. Thank you Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Now I am a proud immigrant who came to the United States as a young child. We grew up poor. English was our second language. And we often like many immigrant families struggled to get by. But my mom, she moved here to the United States because she believed in the American dream. I'll never forget the day that I became a United States citizen. I raised my right hand and I pledged an oath to protect and to love this country. It was the proudest day of my life. My mom taught me to love this country. She taught me that real American patriotism is not about screaming and yelling America first. Real American patriotism is loving your country so much that you want to help the people in your country. That is American patriotism. And we all know that Kamala Harris understands and knows this as well. Kamala Harris is ready to lead this country. We can all remember 2020. We can all remember the horrors of Donald Trump. But let's remember most importantly tonight and every single day this week that we are not going back. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " And I just want to start off by saying that I take voting very seriously. I appreciate all the discussion around voting. I'm an immigrant. And so for me, the day I raised my right hand and took a note to our country and Constitution and earned the right to vote. I was in my 20s. It was to this day the most transformational moment of my life. And it's something that is incredibly important to me personally. And so I just want to thank everyone's work on voting rights. Now, I consider myself a patriotic immigrant. I'm also a former mayor and someone who cares deeply about democracy. And like many of our conversations in this committee, I find today's conversation deeply disturbing and offensive in so many ways. Now, this committee is now for the third time chosen to waste our time on working and trying to figure out local laws and what D.C. should or should not be doing. I loved my time in local government and as mayor of my community and when I served on the council. But I oftentimes feel like I am back on my city council whenever we bring up District of Columbia here in D.C. And I encourage my house colleagues if they want to get so involved in local government. They should run for office here in Washington D.C. There are plenty of city council seats that are open. There are plenty of positions to be appointed to. And they should stop making D.C. their partisan playground for attacking elections, attacking mostly non-white voters and attacking our democracy. Now, D.C. residents are Americans who deserve the same rights and privileges and anyone else. Folks here are working hard to ensure that people have access to the ballot box. And we don't need House Republicans pushing voter suppression and a pro voter suppression campaign on D.C. I remind us that D.C. is the highest voter registration rate I believe in the nation. Now, let's start with some facts. There's no crisis of American confidence in elections except for when Donald Trump created one across the country. And many people rightly feared for the integrity of our elections when Trump welcomed the Russian support and interference in 2016. This whole rant about elections and the destruction of our democracy starts with former president Donald Trump. Now, let's be real clear, Joe Biden won the last election as much to the dismay of Donald Trump and many House Republicans by earning 7 million more votes and 74 more electoral college votes than Donald Trump. Now, with Donald Trump's ego disregard for the Constitution and the rule of law and his pathological fear of being a loser that led him to lie to the American people. Many people knew then and know now that he continues to lie and replete this great lie to cover for him and his loss. Now, there is no evidence of voter fraud in D.C. or anywhere else. The District of Columbia nailed each registered D.C. voter a mail ballot for the 2020 election and over 200,000 residents voted by mail with no evidence of voting fraud. Now, this legislation that Republicans are discussing and want to promote will actually make it harder to vote in D.C. and will have less of a voice for the American people. So I just want to repeat that despite the fact that it keeps being mentioned, there is no voter of some widespread voter fraud happening in D.C. Ms. Wiesler, can you remind us how common in-person voter fraud actually is? An American is more likely to be struck by lightning than to commit in-person voter fraud according to multiple studies over decades. Absolutely. Thank you. And if voter ID laws don't actually work or solve any problems, their impact is really about making it harder for Americans to vote. And so we should be clear, voter ID requirements just proportionally affect non-white voters. That is clear. I think that's been studied. Ms. Wiesler, can you remind the committee what happened after the passage of the Texas 2021 voter suppression on the Miss Bill, which required the presentation of driver's licenses, absentee ballot applications, and what happened then? The Brennan Center actually studied the impact of just one of the provisions in this massive voter restriction bill, which is the requirement that voter ID numbers be provided with absentee ballots and absentee ballot applications. We found that tens of thousands of ballots were rejected 10% of those ballots that mail ballots. And that it was disproportionately African-American voters and Latino and Asian voters, 19% of Latino and Asian ballots were rejected and 16% of African voters. We should be holding hearings about that travesty. We should be holding hearings about disenfranchising non-white voters across this country that is happening in state legislature after state legislature. So I just want to thank you for your work. I want to thank, and once again, restate my position that Washington, D.C. should be a state and the people here deserve the same rights as anybody else in this country. And I want to thank you for your time. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.",

        "transcript": " I just want to thank all of you, friends, supporters, most importantly my family for being here for what really is an exciting day and it's a special day for me and for our neighbors and for the community. I guess I should make it official, but as all of you know, I'm here because I'm running for the Long Beach City Council and I'm looking forward to making Long Beach a better place for all of us. And there's some people here that I want to point out before we get started. I see some people from my Long Beach City College family. Thank you for being here. I also obviously I want to thank Ernie and Caesar who have opened up their home today. This is a 1902 colonial revival. It's just as beautiful on the inside as it is on the outside. And I see Ernie and Caesar here. Let's give them a round of applause for thanking you for opening up your home today. And if you don't know, Ernie has been a longtime leader and fighter and supporter of the Wilmore City area and he's been a longtime community activist and having his support and Caesar support means a lot. So thank you both for opening your home up today. I do also want to say thanks to two other people that are here right now and those are two of our elected officials and I see Vice Mayor Val Lerks that's here and I want to thank Val, thank you for being here and I also want to thank him for his support because he's endorsed me as well so I want to thank you Vice Mayor Lerks for your support and I also want to thank a council member who I will be working with very closely on downtown issues and that's Council Member Suja Lohantau who's here as well. Council Member Lohantau, thanks for being here and the council members from the first and second have to work together oftentimes on many of the issues that face the area and the region. Suja, I look forward to working with you on that. I'm making downtown and the neighborhood surrounding it as well as the whole city a better place so thanks again for your support as well. But most importantly I need to thank my family because quite frankly I am and why I am because of the strong work and the dedication and the love of the people that are here close to me right now. You know we didn't grow up with a lot. My mom often times worked two jobs. I didn't even see her very much often times but what we had at home was a lot of love and what we had at home was commitment to each other. And my aunt and uncle are here who are off my second set of parents so thank you for being here. I love you both very much. My two cousins Jonathan and Joey who are who I grew up with like my brothers. We all grew up in the same household by the way all together. And so they're like my brothers thank you for being here. My brother Jacob is here. My stepdad Greg I think is hiding over there. He's a little shy. And of course my mom who is the light of my life my best friend, my lifetime partner and everything that we do together so this is just as much about you as it is about me so I love you mom. Thank you for being here. I think as Josh and mentioned you know I feel very fortunate. Now I was born in Lima Peru little did I know that I would end up in Long Beach. What brought me here was the opportunity to go to college at Cal State Long Beach. And I actually remember when it was time to apply to school you're none of us had been through that process that application process. We know one of my family has a college education but what we didn't know is that we used to come down to Mother's Beach when I was a child in Long Beach and we'd get a memory we'd come down to the beach we'd splash around we'd play around so I had very fond memories of Long Beach when I was young so when it was time to apply to college Long Beach was the place. What's important today is what we do for not just the downtown neighborhoods for the rest of the city. And so I often get asked you know why are you running? Why do you want to do this? The easy answer for me is I'm running for the City Council because I love Long Beach. I love the city. I believe in its potential. I love the fact that it's diverse. Look around just the people that are here. We all look different. We're different colors. We have different beliefs. I love the fact that it's historic that we're in this beautiful home that's been built in the early 1900s and it's been restored and taken so well care of. I love the fact that we are an urban community but at the same time a community of neighborhoods and I love the fact that we're a downtown by the coast. Now let me say something about that I think which I think is important. We are the only downtown on the water between San Diego and San Francisco. We're also the only downtown by the water that really has a shoreline and actual beach in front of it yet we don't take care of it. We don't sometimes realize the potential that we have. We can be the greatest city in the state of California. I want to set off by saying that this election is not about the past. This election is about the future and it's about what are we going to do tomorrow and what are we going to work on together to make the future better. We are in a fiscal crisis. There are major issues facing the city and it's going to take hard work and tough decisions because the decisions that need to be made are not going to be easy. They're going to be tough. The first and the most important is always a commitment to safe and clean streets and you can be sure that my number one priority will always be the safety and security of the people that live in the city. And that means that we're always going to be supportive of our police and firefighters making sure that they're well trained and showing that we're tough on games, that we're tough on crime. Ensuring that graffiti removal is a top priority always for the city. That we're doing prevention programs that we're working with our youth. That we're ensuring that our youth have somewhere to go after school, working with our school district. That will always be what's most important. Secondly, is that we live in a healthy and clean environment. And that means creating new parts. There's all these great spaces in this neighborhood that are being created as you can probably see new green spaces. And we need to create more of those, but especially in neighborhoods that are, you know, are disadvantaged, that have more poor, that have people that are less fortunate. We need to create those opportunities. And we need to activate our current parts. Here are current parks. And another thing that I mentioned before is we need to reclaim our beach fund. We need to activate the beach. And a lot of good work is already being done there. But we need to do a better job of reclaiming our beach. And I'm also very supportive of the breakwater study that's looking at reconfiguring parts of the breakwater. And finally, I think something that is important to the city is we need to have efficient and responsible city government. And what does that mean exactly? The first is a clear commitment to balancing the city budget and fiscal responsibility. And I think it's important right now that we all need to know that we're in a bad shape. And this is not just bad shape in the city. We're in bad shape in the country. The state is in horrible shape as well as our own city. So we need to ensure that we look at every single area of government for waste, for mismanagement. And that we're ensuring that we're providing the best for the taxpayers of the city. And so you have my commitment that I will work very aggressively and very tough to make sure that we are providing the best, efficient, run government as possible. And there's a couple of things that I want to bring out that I think would make that even more efficient. One thing that I will be a strong supporter of is a citywide 311 system. If you're not familiar with 311, the cities of San Francisco, of New York have the system. And it's a system where instead of having to call various numbers or phone numbers for information, you can call one phone number. You call 311 and you can get information about trash services, information about graffiti, information about community organizing, all from one number, which I think makes government more efficient and is easier for the residents. You also have my commitment to ensuring that our city website is a 24 hour city hall. And that you could be able to go on the website and do as much as possible at any time possible to improve city services. I think it's important that we make all of our public spaces wireless. And I think that's something that clearly needs to be done. Our public parks should be wireless. We should be encouraging technology and encouraging really the future. So in closing, I just want to say that one thing that you will always get for me is I'm here to represent everybody. I know what it's like to grow up poor. I know what it's like for English not to be your first language. Spanish was my first language. I know what it's like to not have a lot of money to have to make sacrifices. And so because of that experience, I feel that I can relate to every kind of person, whether they're the poorest and the most unfortunate situation to those that have been able to succeed and get on their own. And it's my hope that I'm going to be able to reach out to everyone, regardless of where they come from in the city. And let me leave everybody with this. I really strongly believe that this campaign and just this whole process is going to be a team effort. This really isn't about me. This is about all of us and about what we can all do. And I'm going to need all of your help because this is not going to be easy. There's a lot of tough decisions that are going to happen. But I think that we can do this together. We're going to make the city more green, more progressive, safer, a better place to live. And at the end of the day, we're all going to be better off for it. So thank you all for being here. I love you all. I really do and go Long Beach. And let's win this thing on April 7th. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Ladies and gentlemen, Andy Garcia. APPLAUSE I've been living my entire life, Sean, with people saying, what was it like to work with Sean Connery? What was it like to work with Sean Connery? So tonight I'm going to share a couple anecdotes of what was like to work with Sean Connery. One of the first things we did was a scene where Sean Conner was going to take this enthusiastic plea from Charlie's Martin Smith about that we can nail alcohol through because of tax evasion. So we got to the set and before we got dressed we were doing a rehearsal and Sean was in dressing his golf clothes with, you know, pair of red polyester golf pants. And we go through the rehearsal, you know, kind of talked about the scene a little bit, not really too much, but Brian says, well, Sean, what would you like to do in the scene? Well, I'm going to read the newspaper, I'll sit in the corner, read the newspaper. LAUGHTER And I said, I said to myself, oh god, that's what I was going to do. And Brian turns to Sean, he says, OK, Sean, you're dismissed. And he walked off the set, came back at four o'clock in the afternoon, after a five hour golf game. They sat down in the corner and they did a close-up and a master. He got up and he says, oh, now it's time to get you. You want to really know how to get components, not into a time to get components. And he walked out and he worked for like five minutes after 18 holes of golf. And me and Charlie grabbed them after the scene and said, that was very clever of you. You know, the fact that you came in, you already dressed for golf, you sat in the, you didn't even play the scene until the end of the day. You came in, you said, one line, you walked up, they get a big close-up of you. The scene was over and he said, it's not my first bar, but you. Then we do another scene, there's a phone call and from Malone to tell me where to come. He's got the bookkeeper. So I step in, imagine the camera's looking like this and I step into the scene. And I pick up the phone, but you know, and I say, hello, it's George Stone. He goes, yeah, yeah, Charlie Dester, get to 14, last scene, whatever the hell thing was. And right away, okay, thanks. And I hang up and Brian goes, come on, come on, come on. I'm going, what's the right, Andy, we didn't see her face. And I said, well, Ryan, you know, the phone is over there, the camera's over here. And my character doesn't know there's a camera in the room, there's a phone there, you know. He asks us the phone and who cares, just, you know, it's not a big deal. So I look off camera, Sean's going. So now I go in again, take two. Hello, yeah, it's, and I turn kind of a little bit, you know, I go like this. Yeah, it's something so other here, we're seeing it. It's a cut, cut, cut, Andy. You need to turn more, we're not really seeing your face. And I said, okay, and then Sean, here he goes, come on, Kate, it's not hamlet. And there's a lot more stories that I won't say in order to protect the integrity of my fellow actors. Things like, I don't know what to do here, you know, maybe it's a lock of intelligence on your part. The list goes on and on. I'd like to read a brief, a brief note from your greatest admirer. And I promised that I would read this. Dear Mr. Connery, as a young boy, I waited with great anticipation for the premiere of your latest bomb picture. I was always at the matinee performance on opening day, not because of the reduced prices, but so I could stay in the theater through the evening shows. At that early age, I was so taken by your character in those films that I took on an alias. So whenever someone would ask me my name, I would look at them dead in the eye and say, I'm a mon, Ramon. Those performances and those magical moments in the theater inspired me to dream the dream. The dream of becoming an actor in films. I have active side by side and at times head to head with a one and only extraordinary for Sean Connery, playing that role of one who is long overdue Oscar. Shaken's turn that, baby. My deepest appreciation and admiration to all my greatest inspirations from Garcia and the Garcia. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Officially I want to thank two people that have been mentors of mine who I had a chance to connect with both of them today. That's of course our US Senator, Kamala Harris and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. Thank you. And of course the members of the City Council. I wanted to say a few just few brief things. The first is, as we know, a special day in any city which is election day. And I want to say that the last four years have been challenging but just incredibly rewarding and amazing. I feel and I, I, I, Matt knows this every day that I wake up every morning and I love going to work. And I love Long Beach so much that it's, this is the greatest honor I will ever have in my life is to represent all of you and to work hard for all of you. There is, there is no better city in America than Long Beach. Yes. Yes. And I'm just incredibly grateful for the support. Not just from the institutional support that I've had from folks within the Democratic Party or within the business or labor community. But most importantly from neighbors that just every day at the door have been so supportive of what we're trying to do. I also want to say that I'm proud of the last four years. I'm really proud of the last four years. Unemployment is at the lowest it's ever been in the history of the city. Our homicide rate is the lowest it's ever been in the history of the city. Over 5,000 private and public sector jobs have been created in the last four years. We have, as you probably are all aware, some of the best investment happening when it comes to streets and sidewalks that we've ever had. We are spending more to rebuild our streets and sidewalks and our community. Then we have in the last 50 years in the city of Long Beach and we could be more proud of that work. We're also proud of the other work that's happening, whether it's protecting our environment and building a more sustainable port and a more sustainable community. Whether it's expanding our services and our libraries or actually hiring more police and firefighters instead of what would have been happening in the past which was actually cutting our cops and firefighters. We have hired more police and firefighters. We have dropped the paradigm response time across the city. And as we all know our education system has stronger than ever. We have increased incredible folks at our community college system at Long Beach Unified and at the school board president Megan Kerr. I have the friends here somewhere and so much other work that is happening. And this could not be possible by the way. If it wasn't and I have to think them. I have learned to love the 6,000 plus city employees that work hard every single day for all of you and for me. Yes. The women and men that put on uniform, whether it's a fire uniform or police uniform, the librarians and our libraries, the park workers that are taking care of our kids, the women that are working hard to clean our offices every single night while we enjoy our families, the hard working public's works officers that are cleaning gutters and fixing our streets. These men and women that I am honored and proud to lead and represent some of which are here tonight. I just want to thank you every day for waking up and making Long Beach a better place. Give them a round of applause. Thank you. Oh wow. And most importantly of course I just want to thank all of you. People ask you how's Long Beach doing and I always say I think things are going pretty well. I think things are going really well and the reason why things are going well is because I believe in the power of optimism and hope. And with people are feeling good about their city. People view and believe that things are happening in the city. This city has more construction happening right now than it's had in decades. There's over six billion dollars of investment happening and building more housing and building more infrastructure and building our community. But we know we also have great and big challenges. And so as we celebrate tonight, I also want to just remind us that we have real challenges ahead in this next turn. And there is no larger challenge we all know than addressing the issues around homelessness and ensuring that as a community we come together to assist those people in our community that need the most help. The truth is that we as a city and a state have failed our homeless community. We have failed the men, women and families that are sleeping on the street every single night. And every single person here at this party and across the city, we all share some responsibility in that. And so I hope that we redouble our efforts to ensure that every single person that currently is on our street has access to a home. And you can be assured that at the very top of my agenda, especially next week when we roll out a very exciting initiative on this topic, that eliminating homelessness will be at the top of the agenda over the course of these next four years. And tied into the issue of homelessness, of course, is the issue of housing. We got to ensure that people have access to housing in our community. Whether it's a senior who's having a hard time paying the rent, or whether it's a student looking for their very first apartment, or whether it's a recent graduate from our university college that can't afford to buy that first home. There's a lot of conversation on this issue up and down the state, but I know that coming to the table as a community, we can work hard to address this issue in the next four years as well. And so you're going to hear a lot about how we can build and ensure that we create a long beach and housing for everyone in our community. And finally, let me just say that as we talk about what's important in Long Beach, and we've talked about it, we have moved the city into the 21st century. Sometimes kicking and screaming, but we've moved the city into the 21st century. We have improved and managed technology. We have launched new initiatives of all types, whether it's sustainable initiatives around technology. But I really hope that as a body and as a government, that we also, over the next few years, get back to basics and the basics of government. And so the questions that I'm going to be asking myself every single day are our neighborhood safe. Do people feel like their community is clean and blight free? How do people feel about their government services? Are we making our city a healthy place to raise a family? Are our budget reserves strong enough for the future or for a future rainy day? Those basic questions around how we govern are what's going to guide me every single day. And so I'm excited about these next four years. I'm excited to have your support every single one of you. I want, please don't head out until I personally thank you and give you a hug or a kiss and thank you for your incredible support of me. And I love you all. And so tonight, I want to, as we close, I do want to say things it's important. I want to thank my opponent. It's difficult and hard to do this. And I want to thank Mr. Khan for stepping up. It's hard to step up. And I look forward to working with him and sitting down with him in the future and hearing his worldview and his point of view. And I look forward to his supporters as well being a part of all the solutions that we have here in the city of Long Beach. And so thank you. So thank you all very much for being here tonight. There's a million people I want to thank personally. But go Long Beach to all my staff out there. I love you for running the ship every single day. And we're just, the part is just getting started. So let's have fun. Go Long Beach. Yes. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Let me first thank our councilman Mike Bonan and Jonathan Burke and Ted Louis and everybody else who worked so hard Sheila to get us together on short notice but guess what? When Americans need to stand up against racism and anti-immigration we have to come together on short notice where ever we need to be. And we have to say the necessary things for today we are not afraid of you. If you are dishonorable you are despicable. If you are despicable you will not be donated by us. We are bad news, I can't make children from their parents. How dare you pull children out of their arms to their mothers? How dare you lie and say you couldn't do anything about it? You are the one to cause it and you are the one that we are going to make to turn it back because what you are doing now is lying, lying, lying. The American people are put up with this president long enough. They are more than we need to see. What more lives do we need to hear? It is time for us to say even though there are those who don't want us to say it. Mr. President you need to be impeached. Yes, God more than it seems to be a thing. But putting this on top of all that he has done is a line with Russia and Putin. His love or the dictators of the world. How he has not said one word about the fact that they have been to our DNC. I am the line that democratic process. He has not said one thing about it but he can wrap his arms around another dictator. Come down on and tell us we are out of swallowed. We are through a journey of surprise again. We are not going to swallow it. You have disrespected all of us. You have violated all of us. And now you have sacrificed our children for your aims and your goals. That is because you want to build the wall. Mr. President there will be no wall built on the back of the picture. You are not a necessity. You have got to make Mexico pay for it. We are not going to pay for it. You are going to find these children. You are going to reconnect them with their families. And we are going to give you out of office. Thank you so much for coming out here. Because history is not going to be kind to this administration. We are not going to recall that we stood up. We are going to stand up. We are not going to consider ourselves victims of this mess again. History will be called the while we try to step on all of us. We kicked him in his will and he stepped on him. And so the president who lies all the time, who will change on the drop of a dime. The president is watching what is going on. And the only reason he came up with this fake initiative of years is to try and say to the people that he's seen come out in huge numbers. I'm sorry, I'm scared. I'm going to back it up but he didn't back it up enough. Because that initiative that he's put out that's not defined, how they're going to connect these children with their parents. And now where are children? They don't have numbers or identification where they can connect parents. And some parents have been deported and their children are still here somewhere. And between this president and the racist attorney general Jeff Sessions and John Caldwell said that they're going to do this. They said publicly that they're going to separate these children from their parents in an issue that they're trying to use to get that role good. So they can intimidate all of us. But again, the message has to be Mr. President, we're not afraid of you. We're not afraid of justice. We're not afraid of John Caldwell. We're not afraid of your administration. And while you think you have got away with everything that you've done, we are going to show you that you haven't gotten away with anything. We want the children back. We want the children back. We want it done now. We want it insisted. If you think we're wrong, you're not here and say nothing yet. Alrighty, you have numbers of your cabinet that have been built out of restaurants. Yes. Who else is thinking about that house? Who's saying no face, no sleep, no blanket, no sleep. And that's what we're going to win this battle. Because while you try and force the Bible, Jeff Sessions and others, you really don't know the Bible. God is on our side. On the side of the children. On the side of what you write. On the side of what's honorable. On the side of understanding that if we can't protect the children, we can't protect anybody. And say let's say the God. Let's make sure we show up. We're everywhere we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, and a gasoline station, you get up and you create a crowd. And you put up a lot of money. And you put up a deal and welcome. Anymore, anywhere, we've got to drop the children connected to their parents. The children are suffering. We don't know if the shots that they're going through can ever be overcome. We don't know what damage has been done to these children. All that we know is they're in cages. They're in prisons. They're in jails. And if you know what they call it, that's where they are. And Mr. President, we will see you every day. Every hour of the day, everywhere that we are. To let you know you cannot get away with this. Thank you so very much. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Yesterday we thought we were on the brink of a showdown between two different groups outside of Congresswoman Maxine Waters office. Now what we expected were that the right wing of keepers organization was going to be there attempting to intimidate the Congresswoman, bringing guns and all of that. And it was likely that counter protesters would come out to protest against them. And we know how that has gone in a number of different instances in the US. A little bit worrisome. Didn't actually happen though. But the protests, which was announced earlier this week was, this is their language by the way, the off keepers. It was against Maxine Waters' incitement of terrorism. And a stand for ICE and the border patrol as they enforce the perfectly constitutional immigration and naturalization laws of this nation, which Trump has ignored in the number of cases. That's what they put on their website by the way. That's the SPLC. Authorities had been in contact with the group apparently though, and it was decided that they would not come in order to ensure peace. That said, just in case it still happened, counter protesters did still show up. They gathered by the dozens and remained long after the off keepers had apparently bailed on their original promise to appear at the office. Now at one point, someone did take a flag off the pickup truck, doused it in oil, and set it on fire. Chanting America was never great. So that part of it is unfortunate, of course. But at least the potential fight between these two groups did not happen. And Maxine Waters herself had been worried that that was a possible outcome. She had warned people not to counter protest, actually. She said that off keepers would like nothing more than to inflame racial tensions and create an explosive conflict in our community. Can I say three things real quick? First of all, hashtag abolish ICE. Second thing is hashtag abolish ICE. And the third thing I'd like to say is hashtag abolish ICE. At least that does not lack clarity. Okay, so I have a number of different opinions on this. So first of all, off keepers are disastrous. They carry weapons around with them and come in camouflage. And so when they start saying Maxine Waters is enabling terrorism and I'm going to come with my weapon, that's a recipe for disaster. So thank God they didn't show up. And I agree with Maxine Waters that I would not want counter protestors there. So now as it turns out, oath keepers didn't show up anyway. But thank God for that because if they had with clearly some of the counter protestors had, you know, were in a frenzied state, okay, in my opinion. If they had met the oath keepers in a frenzied state and one side has gasoline with them and the other side has weapons with them. It's only a matter of time before something like this explodes. So don't do it, don't do it. And if some lunatic right wingers are going whether they've got guns or don't take them. Look, outside of Charlottesville and yes, Charlottesville was shocking that there was a, appeared to be a couple hundred of them there. But almost every other right wing protest is 17 people. Just let them be goofballs by themselves. March around like jackasses and go home, okay. So now the third thing is really important. This, I don't know who did this. We in fact called some of the unions that were present. They're like, we did not participate in that part, right? And because I'm trying to figure out who the hell did it because ripping the American flag first of all from somebody's truck private property terrible and could lead to violence if that person then wants their property back and it's wrong and it's illegal, etc. Saying after government America was never great. Okay, I don't agree with that and I know that at this point there's a lot of rage on the left as well because of all the suppression, oppression, etc. for this long. And you want to have legitimate conversations about the things that America's done wrong throughout history. Are you kidding me? That laundry list is enormous. On the other hand, America's also done wonderful things throughout history. And I would hope to smart people have a conversation about both of those things, right? But the part that really I object to is burning the flag and then this quote, one of them said, this is not the American flag, this is their flag. No, exact opposite. No, the American flag is our flag, it's our flag, it stands for all the things that we believe in, equality for all. The things that are in the Constitution, freedom of press, freedom of speech, human rights, civil rights, it stands for all those things. Now, can we always live up to that? No, but that's why we fight so that we can live up to those principles. So those are our principles. The right wing doesn't own those principles, the right wing hates those principles. Look what they're doing now. They have an authoritarian leader going around the world kissing up to other authoritarian leaders. They never believed in our democracy. They never believed in freedom of the press or speech. They never believed in any other constitution. That's our constitution, our flag. You should fight for it instead of against it. And it's so important that we maintain non-violent civil disobedience. Yes, there's just overwhelming evidence over the history of our country and movements for justice throughout the world that civil disobedience and resistance works specifically when it's non-violent and passive because in those ways we maintain the more high ground. Yeah, and you're not going to out-violent the right wing, okay? And right now they have the government in their control. You're not going to out-violent state violence. It's a terrible idea, both on morality and on effectiveness. I'm not dubious about the story. I'm curious. There are going to be some more details about the story. The details are incredibly sketchy right now. With the Supreme Court is thankfully upheld it. You have the right to burn an American flag. You should unquestionably have that right to burn an American flag. But everyone who burns an American flag in America looks like an idiot. And we talked earlier in this hour about propaganda and already this story will be utilized by the right repeated again and again and again and those images will show up. And no question in the march in the resistance to fight Trump. Burning the American flag today, if that story holds up and is true as reported did significant damage. It was a terrible, terrible, incredibly stupid selfish thing to do. Two easy ways to follow the young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below.

My name is Maxine Waters, and I'm not a friend of George W. Bush. My name is Maxine Waters, and I'm not intimidated by Dick Cheney. My name is Maxine Waters, and I help to get rid of Roomsfail. My name is Maxine Waters, and Connie Rice is nothing but another Neocon, and she doesn't represent me. George W. Bush, let us enter this immoral war. He tricked the American people, and he told us there were weapons of mass destruction. He did not tell the truth. He came out on the battleship and said mission accomplished. He misled us again. He said we were working with the coalition of the willing. It was only a figment of his imagination. He said that we were moving forward with training the Iraqi soldiers who would take over the security. Where are they? They are nowhere as a matter of fact. They're undermining our soldiers in the civil war. He said we were going to get proceeds from the oil that would be pumped back into Iraq so that it could be reconstructed. As a matter of fact, he told us he made these decisions. He said he is the decider, but you know what? He's not the decider. He is the liar. Thank you for being here today. I want you to come to Capitol Hill and lobby on Monday and put some starch in the backs of the members of Congress and give them the courage that they need to do the right thing. It is all right to have some resolutions that are not binding. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating and that will come when it's time to decide whether or not we're going to fund this immoral war. I will not vote one dime for this war. And when you come up here to lobby, you ask these members, are you going to support an appropriation to continue this war, to expand this war, and you can tell the difference between those who are ready to bring our soldiers home and those who are only paying lip service? Don't forget he is not the decider. He is the decider. He is the bring our troop zone. Thank you, Maxine.",

        "transcript": " Please welcome Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Good morning Democrats. You know I just returned from Washington DC where President Biden gave a great state of the Union speech that denounced the Russian invasion of Ukraine and gave his declaration of support to Ukraine. President Biden has demonstrated strong support for voting rights and he certainly understands the importance of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act that is HR4 that could prevent Trump-dominated states in right-wing conservatives from passing voter suppression laws. Black Americans must continue the work of the Civil Rights Movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and dedicated freedom fighters such Andrew Young, John Lewis, Jesse Jackson, Dorothy Height and Fanny Lou Hamer who sacrificed and persevered to pass the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965. And they kept up the fight to protect these rights that were won through struggle and sacrifice and we must all continue to do the same. Blacks in this country truly understand that when we vote we win. Blacks turned out and showed up and voted in unprecedented numbers for Barack Obama. Blacks continue to increase the number of elected officials of color at every level of government. Blacks have won races in some of the most southern states such as Georgia which sent a black man to the United States Senate, Raphael Warnock. And they came within a hair's breadth of cappuccine the Governor's seat for Stacey Abrams. Blacks on the front lines fighting for justice and equality and ensuring this country lives up to the guarantees afforded in the amended version of the Constitution of the United States of America. The Congressional Black Caucus is now 56 members strong in the Congress of the United States of America and represents more than 92 million Americans which is 25% of the United States population and are chairs of six of the most important committees in Congress. For example, representing education and labor, Bobby Scott, Greg Meats, Foreign Affairs, David Scott, Agriculture, Ediburni's Johnson, Science, Space and Technology, Benny Thompson, Homeland Security and yours truly Auntie Maxine on financial services. Does all of this matter? Well, it certainly does. As chair of the Financial Services Committee, I overcame the big banks using their influence to direct money to their concierge clients in our response to the pandemic. And I was able to provide the leadership to reorganize and appropriate $60 billion of PPP money that we were able to send to minority banks and community development financial institution so that they could get that money out to small and minority business persons, business people suffered mightily because of the pandemic. But we were able to respond under the leadership of our president, President Biden to not only support our families and our children, but understanding that many of our businesses had closed down. Many of the small businesses didn't know where to turn. But we stepped up to the fight. My committee and I have been able to fight for money that we send to our states that ensures resources are available to deal with homelessness, assist renters and increase affordable housing and home ownership. I was able to include $10 billion in the American Rescue Plan to assist struggling homeowners and $1 billion of that I ensured was sent to California Marga's Relief Program to help California save their homes. In addition to the money, we sent to states based on population. My committee included an additional $5 billion in response to the pandemic for homelessness. I've led the way in organizing $150 billion more for housing in the bill back better legislation that we're fighting so hard for now. The Republicans are working day and night against our ability to provide the kind of assistance and support to our states. But we don't back up. We don't stop. We keep moving forward. Now, does diversity make a difference? It certainly does. The inclusion of African Americans in decision-making roles certainly make a difference. And I created a subcommittee on diversity and inclusion in the Financial Services Committee. They're very first in the Congress of the United States. And we're compiling data. And we are compiling this data on the hiring and contracting practices of the big banks, Wall Street firms and government agencies. Now, the Republicans do not want to engage on these issues. They're fighting us every day. But Democrats are moving forward. And in the leadership of African Americans, people of color, black folks who understand how important it is for us to register and vote. Again, does diversity and inclusion make a difference? Just take a look at the tremendous work of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a black attorney general whose competence and hard work won the conviction and sentencing of the police officers responsible for George Floyd's death. And make no mistake in understanding, we now have a vice president of the United States of America, black woman, Kamala Harris. And now, we have a nominee that has been put forth by the president of the United States to serve on the United States Supreme Court, Katana Brown Jackson. And this all happens because of the strength of our vote. We elect representatives of color who understand freedom, justice and equality. Blacks must vote as if our very lives depend on it because it is true. We must never be counted out. We must show up in the primary elections and in the general elections in 2022. In the words of Reverend Jesse Jackson, civil rights leader and former candidate for president of the United States who said, and I quote, if we fight, if we vote, we can win. If we don't vote and we don't fight, we will certainly lose. Everything is at stake. And the black community here in California are leading the way as an example of the kind of leadership that can inspire and speak to the successes we have won as a result of our commitment, our fight and our struggle. We're very fortunate to have as a chair of the Democratic Party in this state a very competent, committed leader. Rusty, you are doing a very great job. Rusty, you are providing the kind of leadership and support. And I am so pleased that you worked so well with our black caucus right here in the state. I want you to know because of your support and the strength that you have to provide to our caucus, our black caucus right here in the state of California, the black caucus was in the leadership of supporting our governor when there was an attempt to get him out of office. There was an attempt to basically recall him for office. The black community led by the black caucus, led by those who understand the importance of our vote. They helped to ensure that they turned out the vote so that Garenusum could continue to be Gavin Newsom could continue to be our governor. And so I'm very proud to be here today. I'm very proud to be a part of the Democratic Party of the state of California. And everything that I do every day is with the understanding that we must ensure that we provide leadership for the blacks in this nation, in this state to be a real part of the decision-making and the leadership. Thank you all so very much and thank you Democratic Party.",

It was in 1964 in Atlantic City. And she arrived with a group of black delegates from Mississippi. And she simply asked, she simply asked that her delegates be seated in place of the state's all white delegation. She told the people in the room about the violence she suffered at the hands of white police because she, a black woman, had demanded her right to vote. When she finished, she asked the country a simple but profound question. Is this America? She didn't get the outcome she was hoping for in Atlantic City. But you can bet that when the official Mississippi delegation was seated at the convention, four years later, Fanny Lou Hamer was sitting there with them. Now here we are, here we are, 60 years later at another Democratic Convention with Kamala Harris, Kamala Harris as our party's nominee. Oh, so I know there is no better leader to marshal us into the future. Kamala has been a courtroom prosecutor, a district attorney, an attorney general, a United States senator, vice president of the United States. And when the dust settles in November, and Americans of all stripes have elected her, their president, I know she'll be thinking about Fanny Lou, who I happen to know is one of Kamala's heroes. In that moment, all of us, all of us from New York to Pennsylvania, to Arizona, to California. We can ask ourselves, is this America?

        "transcript": " I'm the project manager for Mom's Clean Air Force and our Latino engagement program called Ecolmailitis. I'm so excited to welcome you today as we celebrate Congresswoman by Ragan's announcement of a new resolution called protecting Latino moms from extreme heat and air pollution. While extreme weather and air pollution affect everyone, low income families and communities of color, often burn the brunt of these challenges, compounded by the systemic issues of housing discrimination, unequal access to healthcare and language barriers. Through my experiences growing up in Costa Rica and living and working in vulnerable communities both there and in the U.S. and dealing with natural disasters, water shortages, vector born diseases, I know that environmental injustices show up in issues of public health and affect people's quality of life. This is what brought me to work with Ecolmailitis to help engage and educate Latino parents and caregivers on the link between the health of the environment and the health of people. And to ensure that all families have the tools and platforms to advocate for stronger environmental regulations, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as the air that we breathe. Ecolmailitis we focus on protecting the health and the future of Latino families that we listen and learn from every day talking about how they're living right next to toxic pollution sources. And this work starts by making sure that our mothers and our parents are protected during the vulnerable period of pregnancy. So this resolution that representative by Ragan is introducing today really highlights the unique risks that pregnant Latina space in the U.S. and how this jeopardizes both maternal and infant well-being. So this resolution is a powerful testament to how community advocacy can really drive change. And we're, we couldn't be more grateful that this is happening today and it's just a huge step forward. And soon you'll hear from true leaders in this movement from the National Hispanic Health Foundation and the National National Campesinas, the National Alliance of Women Farmworkers. But with that, it's my absolute honor to introduce California Representative Naneh Dias Barragan. Thank you so much for your leadership and the care that you bring to this cause. Thank you. Thank you so much. There you go. Well, thank you Danielle. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for being here with us. And thank you to the advocates, to our moms and to our young ones that are even advocates to, for Latina maternal health that have come here today that stand every day on this issue and that will continue to advocate for Latina moms. So today I'm introducing a resolution to highlight the devastating impact that extreme heat and air pollution have on the health of Latina mothers and their babies. Now in many communities across the country, particularly in low income, Latina neighborhoods, mothers are more exposed to dangerous levels of pollution and rising temperatures creating serious health risk during pregnancy. Just take a look at Phoenix, Arizona, for example. So far, Phoenix has had 113 consecutive days of temperatures above 100 degrees. Think about that more than three months of straight 100 degree days. That's dangerous for everyone. But air pollution and extreme health are not just environmental issues, they're issues of equity and health. And Latino mothers, we know are more likely to live in areas with high levels of pollution which expose them to toxins that can lead to things like preterm birth, low weight, low birth weight, and then even still birth. So climate change worsens air pollution and increases extreme heat further threatening these communities. And we of course know that Latina's and Latinos, but in particular, Latina's do more work outdoors and jobs like agriculture, which put the even higher risk of heat related pregnancy complications. And again, this is an issue of justice. Latino communities already bearing the brunt of environmental injustice are now facing the compounded risk of heat and pollution during pregnancy. Too many Latinos do not have access to things like proper health care, air conditioning or green spaces that places them and their babies at greater risk. Now the Biden Harris administration have taken some meaningful steps. They've launched the heat.gov portal for real time extreme heat data and they have proposed a rule to protect millions of workers from extreme heat. They've also created the Office of Climate and Health Equity at HHS to address climate related health issues. But this office still must be funded by Congress to fully carry out the work. So I'm proud that the Implition Reduction Act was able to secure $3 billion for climate and environmental justice block grants, which can be used for clean energy and climate resilience in our communities. But we know far more must be done by Congress and federal agencies. So my resolution calls for urgent, urgent policy action to protect the health of Latina and others. And that includes in doing things like investing and clean air initiatives, professional training for health care workers on the vulnerabilities pregnant women face from pollution and extreme heat, bilingual air quality alerts that we make sure everybody knows in Spanish as well, and improved maternal health care access in more. So we must act now to ensure that no mother has to choose between her health and her job between staying cool and protecting her unborn child. We can and we must do better for our mothers and our babies. And so I want to thank again all the advocates everybody for staying with us every single day. And now I have the honor to introduce Amy Tamiyo, who knows a great deal about the effects of heat and pollution on Latina mothers as the national policy director of the national alliance of farm workers. Amy, thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you, Congresswoman Barragan for your attention and efforts to protect Latina's including farm worker women. My name is Amy Tamiyo and I'm the National Advocacy and Policy Director with Alianza National DeCampacinas or the National Alliance of Farm Worker Women. There are an estimated 700,000 farm worker women and girls in the United States, the majority of whom are Latinas and likely to be subjected to low wages, wage theft, discrimination, sexual violence and harassment and multiple health risks due to heat and chemical exposure. For weeks and sometimes months on end, farm workers are required to work through high temperatures, having to start their work day as early as 1 a.m. to avoid extreme temperatures during the day, which can cause heat stroke, dehydration, heat stress, high risk pregnancies or even death. Without a federal standard ensuring workers paid shaded breaks, access to cool water or medical care if the experience heat related injuries, farm worker women often get sick from heat even though it is entirely preventable. Without being able to cool off during the work day, it is even more crucial to be able to cool off after the work hours in the home. However, that is often not possible because of the poor housing conditions. In addition to heat, farm workers are also exposed to a lot of pollution because they are exposed to harmful chemicals in the workplace and in their communities. Pesticide exposure in the fields is highly toxic and poses dangerous risks to farm worker women who are often not told which chemicals are being applied in the fields. What the associated risks are or how to protect themselves from those pesticides. This leads to many farm workers often times unknowingly exposing or contaminating their family members, something by such as accidentally contaminating their children's clothing, food, or skin, puts everybody at risk and sometimes simply just by living near the farms that they work in, their homes are also directly exposed by pesticide drift in the air. Pesticide farm workers are particularly at risk of higher health impacts because some of the pesticide exposure can cause pre-term labor, miscarriages, infertility, and various forms of cancer affecting the reproductive system. Additionally, many children of farm workers experience some of these health challenges as well due to the pesticide exposure during their mother's pregnancies. It has been well researched and found that some herbicides cause neurological behavioral developmental challenges due to the utero exposure to pesticides, but we also see high numbers of asthma, impaired vision, and hearing ADHD and autism. Farm worker families are also not likely to have health insurance or access to health care due to their immigration status or lack of resources. In fact, about 50% of farm workers do not have health insurance compared to the 10% of the general population. It is also common for farm worker women to struggle accessing health care due to the language barriers, living in isolated rural areas, or not being able to get an examination by health care providers that don't have the knowledge on what the health risks are from the heat and the pesticides. This means that many live with conditions that are undiagnosed and untreated for years. Today, Alianza is encouraged to hear Congresswoman Barragan prioritize the health needs of Latina farm workers, and we're pleased about the introduction of this resolution because the farm worker women who help us nourish and take care of ourselves and our families also deserve to be taken care of. And they should not have to fear for their children's lives or their health when they go to work every day. Thank you, and I'd like to now introduce Luz Drava from the National Echo Madras team. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I am Luz Drava, and I am the program coordinator for MAMS Clean Air Force and Echo Madras. And this is Dominic. He is my seven-year-old son. As a MAM, this resolution brings me hope, and I believe that many of you feel the same way today. So today, I would like to share part of my story because this mission is very personal for me. In 2016, I was diagnosed with pre-Clency. During the second trimester of my pregnancy, my first reaction to that diagnosed was feeling very, very scared. And I even wonder if I have done something wrong. With the realizing the impact of the climate change and air pollution, how affect expect the mothers and infants? To this day, I wonder if the answer to this issue should involve raising awareness among health professionals. Many doctors will tell you to eat healthy and exercise, but they don't ask you to protect from high temperatures and or air pollution, especially if you're pregnant. In my case, did not help that I live in San Luis, Missouri at that time. In mid-Dwest city, recently named the 30 and most polluted in the nation for ozone pollution. And according to the American Law Association, 2024 State of the Year report, more than 131 million people still live in places with unhealthy levels of air pollution in San Luis metro area that still has work to do. It wasn't until I joined Mom's Clean Air Force and a com address that I learned that a string heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the U.S. and the string heat poses significant help to maternal and infant health. I went through a C-section at 36 weeks of my pregnancy. Unfortunately, today, my son and I are both healthy. To this day, I wish someone would have told me to avoid going outside when the temperatures were extremely high. But also I know that in the U.S. Latinas communities, like mine, are disproportionately impacted by string heat and air pollution. Latinas, for example, are also a high risk for string heat exposure and air pollution because we are more likely to live in areas in the United States that are vulnerable to string heat. At Mom's Clean Air Force and a com address, we remain committed to educating Latinas communities to empower them and mobilize them to fight for clean air and climate change solutions. This resolution is a big step in the right direction and feels made with optimism for our future and hope for our better tomorrow and for mothers and children. Thank you all and right now is my pleasure to introduce our next speaker, the Director of Programs at the National Hispanic Health Foundation, Wadalupe Pacheco. Thank you. When I start this, good afternoon. It's interesting there's only two males up here. I'm going to bring my perspective from two angles. Number one, I'm the oldest of 11. I got eight sisters. So I know some of the challenges that females face and also thinking about my mom, she was a product of a, she was a farm worker. So can you imagine when she was picking fruit, the exposure that she experienced in terms of pesticides? And she did have cancer, she did, luckily she recovered. But let me also just say that I'm on behalf of Dr. Rielena Rios, who's a president of the National Hispanic Health Foundation. She would like to thank all of you here, especially Congressman Barregan for being such a strong advocate and a leader and advocating not only for health equity among Latina women, especially in the area of environmental justice and maternal health. The National Hispanic Health Foundation focuses on Latino health equity. We focus on access through leadership, research and education. So Latina Health falls into those three action pillars. We know that Latina has already been previously stated have existing health challenges, such as higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic health conditions. So you add climate change, you add extreme heat. That's like more added kind of challenges that Latina women face. Additionally, we know that Latinas have higher, let's ignore, disproportionately are affected by environmental pollution as those are already been stated. And it's associated with health risks, adverse maternal health outcomes. So you have outcomes that are not very positive and they have negative consequences because of those environmental kind of conditions that they live under. So NHHF, the National Health Foundation, strongly against support, Congressman Barregan's resolution on protecting Latina moms from health and pollution. And more importantly, to raise awareness of these issues, but also how we can take particular kind of action to mitigate these kind of issues that affect Latina women. We, the National Spanic Health Foundation, recognize that we need to do more research, look at policies and programs, and look at community-based interventions that can reduce the burden of extreme heat, environmental pollution to mothers and their children. So NHHF is ready and willing to advance this important work since its supports our mission. So again, thank you for letting NHHF be part of this important resolution announcement. And thank you for the opportunity to be part of this effort. All right. Thank you so much to our speakers, Luz Dra, Guadalupe Patek, Juan Emit Amajo for sharing your stories and for your ongoing commitment to this work. Thank you to Congressman Barregan for introducing this resolution to protect Latina moms from extreme heat and air pollution. This is a moment of celebration and inspiration to keep pushing for more change and will continue to do so as a collective. Thank you so much. I don't know what to do with my hair. No, thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Good evening. You know, my story is very unique to me, but it's one that is more and more common today. When I was a kid, never would my parents ever have imagined that I would one day be able to work in the White House, much less become a member of the United States Congress. My parents were immigrants from Mexico. My mom came to this country for a better life for her kids. And I was the youngest, as mentioned, of 11 kids. When I was growing up, my parents said to me, you're a doctor or a lawyer, that's the only way you're going to get out of this world, because we were poor. And when I see blood, I want to pass out. So I decided to go to law school. And I made it. My district, the 44th, goes from the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro all the way through Wilmington, Carson, Compton, Watts. It's very working class. Only 10% of students go into college here. I'm one of the lucky 10% of who beat the odds, who got a piece of the American dream, and then said, now's my chance to give back, to make sure that others have the same opportunity. And that's what I see in my role as a member of Congress, to give a voice to those who need it the most. But the path here was not easy. And it wasn't planned. As I said, I never dreamed I would run for Congress. Nowadays, I just read a study the other day that our kids at a very young age, by the time they're six years old, they're already falling into the stereotype. And in this study, they asked kids, they told them about people who were really, really great. And then they asked the kid if they thought it was a man or a woman. I believe it was the six-year-old all identified with their own gender. So if it was a woman, it said, oh, it was a woman. If it was a man, it said that they're a man. But by the time the seven-year-old, you did the same study, and they all reverted to saying that it was a man. So we'd see it very early age at the impact that our stereotypes are playing on our kids. So let me tell you a little bit about my story that I started to tell you about, in particular about how I got to where I am. I went to UCLA undergrad, and then I went to USC for law school. I came out with a ton of debt, and I decided at the time that there was just no way I could afford to do public interest work. And I got very lucky, as a UCLA undergraduate student, I got to work in the Clinton White House, and then I got to work on the Hill with the NAACP. I was just an intern, and I thought then, you know, if I worked really hard, maybe I could come back one day and serve a president, still not thinking that I might run one day. But I started practicing law, and seven years went by. I was very politically active behind the scenes, helping other people get elected. Still not thinking that I would run. I decided to move to Florida to work on a presidential campaign, doing voter protection work, thinking, where can I apply my skills? And when I got home, I said, what can I do locally in my community? Now that I've paid down this debt, what could I do locally in my community? And I was flipping through the channels one day, and I saw City Council meeting. It was all men. There were no people of color, so I started to Google these guys. And I said, they're not that impressive. I could do that. And that is when I decided to run for City Council. Now, at the time, there was an oil company that wanted to drill in a neighborhood, and then out into the Santa Monica Bay, and I immediately took a position and people said, what are you doing? You don't know which way the wind's blowing. And people also said, you can't win. Nobody knows who you are. You're not from around here, and they were true. The city I was running in, I wasn't from around there. Just to give you an idea, it was 86% Anglo, and about 5% Latino. And I said, you know what, my entire life, somebody's always telling me why I can't do something. You can't do something because your parents are immigrants, because you have no money. Whatever it was, somebody was always telling me that. So when I heard this, I said, you know what, I've heard this on my life. We'll see how it goes. And I worked really hard. Now, having worked in politics behind the scenes and helping other people get elected, I knew that it was going to take a lot of work. I knew I was going to have to knock on doors and raise money, and we did all that. I became the first woman in 10 years elected to the city council in our most obiach, and the first thing they ever elected. And I spent my time there fighting this company, this oil company. It wasn't until after we beat this oil company that I started getting calls from people saying, we think you should consider running for Congress. And it was actually a member of Congress who called me and said, I've seen what you've done. This is a community where you grew up, where your family is. We need somebody who's going to make sure to give a voice to those who need it the most, and to represent our community to be at the table. Because you know what they say. If you're not at the table, you're on the menu. And in this environment, today's day and age, isn't that so true? So I hung up the phone with the member, and I thought about it. I didn't take it very seriously at first, but then I looked at the numbers. Now, if you ever want to run for something, I highly recommend there's a lot of women's ready to run programs. But Emily's has something called the POP program, political opportunity program. I did it before I ran for city council. What I really liked about it was a one day crash course. It was completely free. And it tells you what you need to do. Raise money, who you call, had a message. It was a real good crash course, and I encourage everybody to do it. The women, especially if you don't think you ever want to run. But let me tell you, when I was running for Congress, I did the old fashioned way. I knocked on doors. My district is 70% Latino, and you have never had a Latino representative in this district. You know, when I got into the race people called and said, what are you doing? It's not your turn. Somebody else was promised to see. And I said, you know what, I've heard this all my life. We'll see how it goes. Right? But I knocked on those doors. And one of the things that I really love is when I knock on the doors, and I would, young kids would come out. Seven, eight, nine. I would get down on a knee. And I would say, what do you want to do when you grow up? And you would hear these kids say, I want to be a teacher, or I want to be a beautician. And I would say, how about the President of the United States? You know you could be the President of the United States one day. And you should just see their eyes light up. And the big smile on their face, nobody's ever told them that before. We need to tell that to every young person you see. You know that women need to be asked seven times to run before they run. And men wake up in the morning and say, I could be President of the United States today. It's a true story. So I take every moment I can to tell young Latinas, Latinos, boys and girls that they could be whatever they want. I'm the prime example of that. Now who could have ever imagined? And so, you know, I had a very tough congressional campaign. My opponent was hand picked. I wasn't supposed to win. The party was against me. The mayor was against me. The governor was against me. And I kept going. Now I had to quit my job a year and a half out because I did a full time. I know that it's a little crazy. Sometimes people say, what would you do? At the end of the day, I knew I was completely invested in it. And when I'm set out to do something, I put 110% in it. And I don't do it just to get my name out. I do it because I want to win. And it was a very tough race. And it's harder for women than it is for men. And it's harder for Latinas than it is for otherwise. Especially because of the amount of money you have to raise. It's so very difficult. So if there's one thing today, I tell young people is build your network. Those people that you go to high school with, keep their information, become their friends, maintain those friendships, college, same thing. You never know where it will take you. And why is it so important that we're at the table? Because we need a voice. Look at the number of women you have in Congress today. It's 11 Latinas in Congress. That's just unacceptable. Right? I happen to sit on Homeland Security. The wall that we're talking about that the president wants to do is coming to my committee. You can bet on one vocal person on this wall. And by the way, my mom, she has no idea what I do in Congress. My mom has a third grade education. I show her the photos and every time I'm in the paper, she'll go get 12 copies of it. And say, like, me, Hamina. But for me, it's really an honor to serve the people of the 44th Congressional District. My story for me is one I could never have really planned out. Sometimes we have these plans in life and we divert from the plans. I'm very risk-adverse, so I don't like to take big risks. I like to say I took a calculated risk and it paid off. And so I encourage every single one of you whether you want to run, whether you have young people that you think are big-rate, think about it. And it's okay to divert from the plan every now and again. But really investing in ourselves and our future, because we are the future of this country. And we need to have young people and young representation at the table so we can give a voice. We provide a very different perspective, both whether you're a woman, whether you're a Latina, whether you're an immigrant. It's all added value and diversity that we really need at the table. So thank you so much for hearing me out today. I look forward to meeting every single one of you and reach out to our office and let us know how we can be of assistance. Don't let somebody to tell you to wait your turn. The time is now. Let's run. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Today I rise with a great sense of gratitude, gratitude for the opportunity to serve the people's house, gratitude for passing my first standalone bill, HR 189, the John Lewis National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Endowment Revitalization Act. It passed the House and the Senate and on a bipartisan basis to boot. The bill is on its way to the President's desk and on Friday President Joe Biden will sign it in a White House ceremony that this kid from the harbor area of Los Angeles never dreamed was possible. This is a full circle moment for me. One that made me tear up last night as I sat to reflect how I got here and how my passion on the issue of disparities and health took shape. In 1998 as a young college student I had the opportunity to work as an intern in the Clinton White House. I worked in the office of Public Liaison doing African American outreach under Ben Johnson and Minyan Moore. It was during my work there that I learned about the issue of racial health disparities. At the time United States Surgeon General David Satcher highlighted the issue and it became a passion of mine. A year later I would continue my work on the issue and in the health care space at the end of the ACP with Hillary Shelton. Ben Johnson and Hillary Shelton mentored and inspired me. They encouraged me to keep up my work on the issue. Today as a member of Congress the issue of racial health disparities and the need for us to close the health care gap is among my top priorities. In that light during the 116th Congress I was in my second term that an opportunity arose to work with organizations like the association of minority health profession schools and others on a bill to help fund research on health disparities at schools of excellence. I remember approaching our friend the late John Lewis about the bill. He encouraged me to fight to get it across the finish line and it agreed to become an original co-sponsor. In this Congress the 117th Congress I renamed the bill in honor of my friend the late John Lewis. HR 189 is now the John Lewis National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Endowment Revitalization Act. I thank the gentleman from Georgia rep buddy Carter for being a co-lead on the bill. The Senate bill S320 was introduced and championed by Senators Bill Cassidy and Brian Schatz. I am grateful for their work to get this across the finish line and Senator Cassidy for being gracious. HR 189 will once again allow for current and former NIM HD or health resources and services administration centers of excellence to receive research endowment funding. Money that is critical in the fight to reduce minority health disparities. The research endowment program at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities provides funding to the endowments of academic institutions across the country. Schools like Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science will qualify more House School of Medicine, the University of Puerto Rico School of Dentistry, to Stuggie University College of Veterinarian Medicine, Xavier University of Louisiana College of Pharmacy, and many more will be eligible to receive funding under this bill. The goals of the program include promoting minority health and health disparity research capacity and infrastructure, increasing the diversity and strength of scientific workforce, and enhancing the recruitment and retention of individuals from health disparity populations that are underrepresented in the scientific workforce. On Friday, 24 years after getting my start in politics at the White House, I will be back there again. This time, as a member of Congress to see HR 189 become law and move us one step closer to ending the disparities in public health facing communities of color. For that, I am grateful. I yield back.",

        "transcript": " Chair recognizes the general general lady from California Miss Bergon for five minutes. Mr. Speaker, this week I have the honor of traveling to the beaches of Normandy, France, along with the congressional delegation to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day. On the exact site, we're over 2,500 brave Americans were to, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, give their last full measure of devotion. Several among those fallen were some of the nearly 500,000 Latino soldiers who served in World War Two. By the end of that war, 17 Mexican Americans received the Congressional Medal of Honor, a source of great pride for the Latino community, and a legacy of honor that has continued throughout modern history, which now counts 60 Medal of Honors awarded to soldiers of Hispanic heritage. Among the military units, with Hispanic representation that participated in the D-Day invasion was the Army 79th Infantry Division, which landed at Utah Beach. The D-Day forces included men like Nick Alvarez from California who led a tank crew that broke through the German defences that day, helping to put the allies on the offensive, and ultimately helped lead to the fall of Nazi Germany. Those D-Day forces also included private Andrew Ortega from Anaheim, California, who was one of the very first Americans to land on Omaha Beach as part of a team of engineers tasked with finding and neutralizing landmines ahead of the infantrymen taking part in the assault. Under relentless fire from German guns, private Ortega searched for and defused landmines, no bigger than eggs, his heroic efforts in the face of horrific danger, no doubt saved countless American lives. As we make ready to honor all the troops participating in the D-Day invasion, I'd like to take special mention of private Louis Martin, who was a resident of my home district in Wilmington, California, and who was pictured here in this photo provided by his family. Private Martin was born in Demi, New Mexico in 1914 and moved to Wilmington as a young adult. By the time Louis was drafted into the army, he was married and he had a two-year-old daughter. Louis was a member of the US Army First Infantry Division, which landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day, and it is there on the sounds of that beach 75 years ago that private Martin gave his life for the freedom of his family and his countrymen and for the future generations of Americans. We, as a nation, are forever indebted to him and it gives me great pride to have him remembered here today. I would like to thank those that served and I would like to extend my deepest condolences to private Martin's family and friends and to thank private Martin and all those members of the Armed Forces who so bravely fought and so gallantly sacrificed their lives in the service of our nation during the D-Day invasion. It is with the greatest appreciation for their courage and determination and fierce belief in this nation for which it stands that I pay tribute to these fallen soldiers today and it is in their honor that I pledge to endeavor within this body to strive ever harder to fulfill the promise of this nation proposed by our founders and paid for with the blood of soldiers like those who fell 75 years ago on the sands of Normandy. Thank you. I you'll back.",

        "transcript": " Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the millions of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and their family members and caregivers. I'm speaking up because the Center for Medicare and Medicaid, CMS, made a decision that will severely limit access to the only drug shown to slow the progression of Alzheimer's. I think their decision is a mistake. Alzheimer's is a heartbreaking disease. It has no cure. These are the faces of Alzheimer's. They are our sisters, our brothers, our mothers, our fathers, our neighbors, our grandparents, our fellow Americans who are living with this dreadful disease. As time passes, they are slipping away from their loved ones a little bit at a time. They have asked and hoped for something to help them, anything, anything that could give them more time with their families. And for the past 20 years, there has been little progress on new Alzheimer's drugs. Like too many other Americans, I have had the heartbreaking experience of watching my mother's struggle with Alzheimer's and still have the challenge of finding sufficient caregivers to help care for her and those who speak Spanish. My mother's story is not unique. Nearly six million people in the United States are suffering from Alzheimer's and this number is growing every single day. Last summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first new Alzheimer's drug providing hope for families, but CMS will not cover it. They finalize a coverage policy that will tightly restrict access to the entire and only known class of drugs that has shown promise to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Is that the way we should respond to this crisis? This is an access issue. People who have money and can pay for it will get the drug. People who are under a CMS program will not. Every day, Americans living with Alzheimer's are burdened with the expense of caregivers, doctors visits, and seeing their family members decline. This is why my colleagues and I let a letter urging CMS not to limit access to breakthrough therapies for Alzheimer's patients. And as a representative of over 150,000 Angelinos who are living with Alzheimer's disease, I am deeply disappointed with CMS's decision. These are my constituents and members of my community as well as yours. Time is not on our side in this fight. To all the patients, families, and caregivers out there who are struggling with Alzheimer's, I am not done. I stand with you and I will continue to fight for you. I yield back.",

They're more wristwatch checks, but I will consider them extensions to a watch review if I have one. Or these could be, you know, ongoing user experience reviews. These are things that I keep going off the top of my head on a particular watch. But I usually use these videos to show off strap pairings with a particular watch as well. Honestly, I think I might have to discontour these like a series review. Like of one watch. I just keep throwing them out and I know people that watch review, one just one watch review, but I'm probably not going to be making one like that anytime soon. And this is maybe also more for those that are really interested in a watch, a particular watch, and want to just kind of see more of it and, you know, just different lighting, especially different straps. Just the possibilities and get some ideas going and maybe help to solidify a potential purchasing decision. You've seen it so many times and so many kind of slight variations of the same watch with the same person that get a good feel for how this might work for somebody. But anyways, this is of course the tag-hoyer Formula One. This is the newest version that has been reissued this year, 2025, in 38 millimeters, which is a good upsize to the original, which is 35 millimeters. And there's another improvement. Again, there's a very accurate solar quartz moving in here. It's been like plus three for the last. It went up a bit, then went back down, but it's hovering right now after about four or maybe five months at about plus three seconds. So quite good. Lume is very good on these as well, although I do wish the hands were a little bit, maybe if they were a little bit larger, they would show up a little bit stronger compared to the hour markers, but in general they still show up. And I can read it just fine and overall the Lume is very reactive and very long lasting as well. And it did make some changes to the case besides being upsize, especially the way they did the looks. It was more of a downturn and I think that looks a lot better than the original in my opinion. The original was, because it's 35 millimeters, the looks attended to actually also have this general shape from on top, but they came up more straight out from the side. You have a look at it, you'll see what I mean. And they look more like a soap bar, like a small hotel soap bar, if you know what I mean. The kind of shape and the dimensions that give me that kind of feel for some reason. And this doesn't do that, this looks sweet, especially with the...",

        "transcript": " A few months ago, as some of you likely know, I made a short documentary all about Group B and its rise and fall. Briefly at the end, I mentioned Group S. I had advised watching the full video to get a proper breakdown of the subject. But in essence, when Group B was no longer viable to keep running because of the deaths of both spectators and drivers, Feesers shut the whole championship down. The PES pride to this had been planned to be brought in in 1988 to replace Group B. Homologation rules were lessened where 10 cars were required instead of 20 liking Group B, as well as focusing on making it cheaper for manufacturers to showcase innovations. Ultimately, however, Group S was axed along with its older brother and so it was left in history. But upon the Group S rules being written in 1985 albeit in a draft form, a lot of manufacturers jumped on board pretty quickly. They began building prototypes of these Group S races, but of course when the championship was terminated, the prototypes became a lot more valuable than what they were originally thought to be. We therefore have a collection of Group S rally cars that never truly saw the light of day and are generally overshadowed by their Group B cousins. Today, let's take a look at these Group S cars and how they changed from Group B. Toyota did have a presence in Group B, the Celica TCT. However, the TCT was rear wheel drive, thanks large in parts of the fact that it was introduced in 1983 when it was the norm to build rear wheel drive rally cars. When four wheel drive became the norm in the next few years, the TCT faded away and isn't remembered that well. So when Group S was announced, Toyota wanted a fresh start and to turn over a new leaf. Enter the Toyota MR2 triple 2D. This thing does look pretty similar to the regular counterpart until you take a closer look. For example, the width, which is now much wider to encompass wider tire sizes and for better stability. Plus, the iconic pop-up headlights have been replaced with traditional fixed ones, as well as the addition of rally spotlights which both improve aerodynamics. Two engines were also theorised to be in the triple 2D, a 2.1 liter 40 GTA which was used in the TCT and a 2.2 liter Group C prototype, which is apparently where the triple 2D name comes from, MR2 2.2 liter 3.2s. Power ranges were supposedly between 600 brake horsepower and 750 brake horsepower, and the 750 kilogram weight would have made the triple 2 a nippy little monster. Speaking of monster, this prototype was named the Black Monster, based on the fact that the Black Semicol's paint made the color very fierce and very angular. 11 were reportedly built, but with crash tests and other events taking their course, only three remained to day, two black and one white, and tech would care of them. The Ford RS200S is a special story that can't never officially exist, while plans went fairly far with its design, Ford decided not to build any prototype until later in development, which was probably a good thing to retrospect. Other than that, we know it was to feature a brand new gearbox, lighter bodywork, remodeled intercooler and most jarringly, the removal of the protruding air duct from the roof of the car to improve aerodynamics. However, two decades after the demise of Group S, John Wheeler, a cheap designer of the original RS200 and the RS200S, decided to bring the design to life with a specially built replica. First, he bought a moderately damaged rally cross-hours 200 and replaced the bent rear end to have it be returned to better condition. Then work was done to convert the original to the S model, a new wing was added and all the original changes were put into effect. Plus the traditional BDT engine was replaced with a YB engine, which powered the Ford S-Corp Cosworth for a few years in the 1990s, it could supposedly do 485p at cost power and the S was said to be around 90kg lighter than the original. While not completely faithful to the original design, as changes were seen here and there, this is no Frankenstein's monster. Persia was one of the most successful competitors in Group B, so it was a given that they would want a competing Group S. Persia was originally going to go with something along the lines of what Ford did, as they were originally going to simply upgrade their successful 2 or 5. However, the 2 or 5 had a shorter wheelbase than what Persia wanted and even with experimentation on a elongated wheelbase, they couldn't get the 2 or 5 to work under this new structure. So they instead decided to take their brand new 4 or 5, which was released as a standard road going car in 1987. As well as having much better dimensions for what Persia wanted, building a rally version would make for some effective marketing. The team then adapted the 2 or 5 chassis and drivetrain for the new length and the 4 or 5 prototype was born. As well as weighing in near 880kg, it also allowed for a larger fuel tank to be fitted. The 4 or 5 was much more versatile, the engine was also a credit to a 1.9L. However, unlike other Group S prototypes which met the end of their official careers along with the championship, the 4 or 5 T16 actually went on to compete in the Pike's Peacons and National Hill climb and managed a victory. It also meant multiple appearances in heavily modified forms in rally-ready events, with much larger reinforced suspension and a larger fuel tank. It managed to deliver Persia 2 wins in 1989 and 1990 in the Paris de Car Rally. Persia was able to keep their T16 line of races in a competitive form for almost a decade, which isn't too bad. The 130LR was a moderately successful entry into Group B from Scoda. Scoda was intent on improving it and when Group S was announced Scoda only quickened their pace. Originally however, Scoda planned to build a specially modified version of the upcoming Scoda Favourite tour, however you pronounce it. But when the production of the Favourite was delayed, the team decided to refocus their efforts onto the already successful 130, now known as the 130LR Reaver. Why did body kits and tyres were fitted, rear ducts were added for better rear ventilation, rear spoiler became molded into the body, the bonnet was fitted with an air vent to keep the ready at a cool and a lot of other things were added. Alterations were also made to the position of certain elements in the car to help balance out the drastic 40-60 weight ratio in the back of the car. The 1.2-litre engine was also a step up and the 850kg weight was a huge improvement. The car was first tested here in July of 1986 and the car then did some races here and thereafter group S was cancelled, being passed between different owners over the years. Multiple replicas of the Evo have been built but other than that, not much is known. While these prototype are all cool in their own right, there are two specific group S cars that have become truly iconic, even outside of group S. The first of which is the Audi Sport Quattro RS-002. This car should never have truly existed. The prototype was actually built in secrecy without the knowledge of higher ups and even the chairman of Audi. In short, a lot of the team knew that the front engine doubly Quattro would not be able to survive for long. While it was great on fast-straight and corners, slower corners became a problem thanks to the understeer due to the large part of the engine being mounted over the front axle. Mid-engined was the way to go, so they began building these prototype in complete secrecy and test runs were planned to be taken on dirt roads near Salzburg in Austria, but when the press were tipped off, Audi ran for the border to find somewhere else to test the car. Compositely, Audi's Star-Racer Walter Rol could tell almost immediately that the mid-engined Quattro is much faster than the old one. Few pictures remained of this secret prototype. The most notable thing on the car however is the telltale ducts added to the side, but the backlash meant that the mid-engined project had to be dismantled pretty quickly. But another prototype had been made. This one looked radically different to the traditional Quattro design and three were produced. While one was destroyed in another would remain on static display in the museum, one is unaccounted for which, from what I can gather, means that there's still one roaming in the wild. This prototype had very smooth styling and a freakishly large wing, and to many look more like a group C-carber. That's not a bad thing. Then for the 30th anniversary of the final year of Group B, the RS-002 was restored and has since been touring, with Rol occasionally taking the wheel of the car he tested all those years ago. Then there's what is considered the poster child for Group S, the Lancia ECV and all its variants. Even before Group B was banned, the Delta was undergoing major improvements to make it more competitively viable, upgrading the reliability and performance of the gearbox and engine, which we built in the front suspension, shifting the centre of weight were all things on the list, but most importantly was the improvement of the aerodynamics, a particular fault of the original S4. Sidescurses and a retractable flap on the front bumper were considered to be used, but when Group B was cancelled, the project, which was codenamed SEO-4R, was cancelled. But with the prospect of Group S, a new project was started called ECV, which stands for Experimental Composite Vehicle, a lot of the technical innovations from the previous project were brought over, and the resulting car was shown off at the 1986 Belonio Motor Show. Because of the 10 car requirement for homologation, Lancia was able to include some expensive innovations, with a large part of the body being constructed after carbon fibre. The chassis for example also made a large part out of carbon fibre, was 20% lighter than the steel chassis from the S4, while being just as stable. It even supposedly used computer assisted design in its conception, a brand new technology which had only ever been seen in Formula 1 up to this point. The engine also saw some relative changes, with a design that had the turbochargers turn off at different speeds. So at low speeds only one turbo would be functional, but as the speed rose the second turbo would slowly kick in. This meant the engine would work well at low rev ranges, and could do 600 brake horsepower. ECV also featured the aerodynamics from the SEO 4R, with side skirts, a rear diffuser, single head lights, a roof spoiler and side scoops arm making an appearance. The project was well liked and stayed pretty close to the original vision of Group S, a car that would show off the groundbreaking innovations in lightweight chassis and power. And that's not all however, we have the ECV too. It had the same chassis and engine as the first ECV, but the body was wildly different, like what the RS-002 was to the original mid-engine Quattro. Straying away from the sharp almost boxy designs of recent Lancia cars, the body featured a lot of curves and was much more compact. While they were revolutionary in the original car, when the second turbo kicked in, the car had a huge boost of power, which was supposedly uncontrollable, so the ECV2 had smaller turbos. However, due to the ECV2 having the same chassis and engine of the original, and to save cost by not building more, the first ECV had to be dismantled in order to build the ECV2. But on the flip side, a replica of the first ECV was built in 2010 using a standard Lancia beltress for stradale, and now the two ECV brothers stand proud as a monument to group S. I could go on. There are multitude of other group S prototypes that I haven't covered, such as the Mazda RX-7S, the Selti-Bitha bi-motor and the Opel Cadet E4S. If you'd like me to cover these cars, I would be happy to make part two, but to think the cars I covered today were the foundation blocks of group S and what it could have been. Lightware, more powerful and generally some of the best looking cars of the decade, there's no better place to look for crazy cars than the world of the group S prototype. Thanks for watching. I'd also like to give my thanks to the Group B shrine, a website dedicated to uncovering all of the details out group B and Group S. Most if not all of the info presented here today in this video were from them. So if you'd like to learn more about any specific car you've seen in this video, or anything else on the subject, be sure to check them out. Thanks again.",

        "transcript": " I recognize myself for five minutes of question. Mr. Wilson, serve first of all, let me thank you for your service. You got a tough job. Defence of our country, our citizens. You have to play 100% defense. You can't let them score. Anyway, former manor. If I can, let me turn to cyber a little bit. Cyber security. Question. At what point does the cyber attack on our nation constitute a declaration of war? We recently had an attack on our federal court system. Brazen, unbelievable. It's a rhetorical question. I don't think you can answer that. But the point is made, which is cyber is an attack on our nation. And it's a deadly attack in many ways. I presume you're concerned with the increasing cyber attacks, threats from Russian, China, and other actors. Yes, absolutely. This committee recently considered legislation that requires American companies to open their hardware and software to third parties, which could allow some of these actors, China, Russia, and others, to have additional access to US consumer data. Doesn't this pose a cyber security risk? So the cyber threat is a vast and complicated one. The Nascar Division, we're focused on nation-state type attacks, particularly as you mentioned, China and Russia. China actually probably is the most significant actor when it comes to cyber-enabled espionage. It is a challenge for both the government, public sector, and the private sector. And it's one that we are very focused on in the justice department in terms of investigating and prosecuting. We're part of a broad, all of government approach that includes Homeland Security and the intelligence community. You have essentially said that we are seeing nation-states in their proxies increase. Their cyber-enabled means, in a ways that threaten our democracy, and our economic institutions, wouldn't forcing these platforms open, allow the bad actors to have increased access into our systems? I think it's incumbent on the government. That includes the Justice Department and Homeland Security as well as intelligence community to work with the private sector in particular, the large technology companies to make sure that we have a joint effort to address these types of issues. These large companies have a competitive edge, a magic potion here to work with you hand in hand to defend our nation from cyber. My experience has been that the large technology companies are very open to working with the government when it comes to improving the nation's cyber-secure. They have a vested interest, a business interest, to make sure they also play 100% defense. I think our interests are aligned in many ways when it comes to cyber security. That is our interest, the interest of the private sector and the government. Sir Olson, I understand that the executive branch has been reviewing these tech antitrust legislation that I was talking about. You have been part of this review, it's my understanding? Sorry, the review of the... The antitrust legislation. Yes, sir, absolutely. My division was part of the department's review of that legislation. And we've seen concerns raised by former national security experts on both sides concerning these antitrust bills. Is it fair to say that if you have concerns, you'll provide this committee with that information at the right time? Yes, we have provided a letter from the Justice Department in support of the legislation. I'm prepared to continue to work on that with this committee if there are additional concerns that need to be addressed. But you will bring some of those concerns if they are there to this committee? Yes, I continue to work with this committee and others in Congress on this issue. I'd like to submit a letter with our objections for the record titled Open Letter from former defense intelligence, Homeland Security Cyber Officials calling for National Security Review of Congressional Tech legislation without objection. And let me just say that, again, cyber is a new warfare. We are in the state of war in cyber. And I think it's important that your voice be a clear one when it comes to some of this legislation. This legislation primarily applies to American companies yet a lot of the foreign firms Huawei, TikTok, many, many others do not seem to fall under their purview of this legislation. And I believe it's important that before we go off and go after our own firms that we make sure that we're not doing unintentional harms to our national defense when it comes to cyber. Moderna time, let me say. Committee needs to take a moment to address technical issues. Committee will suspend.",

        "transcript": " Outside the Capitol building, Congress members from California, New York, and Illinois announced the reintroduction of the renewing immigration provisions of the Immigration Act from back in 1929. This would provide a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants who were in the U.S. before, and this is key, before the year 2015. Joining us now to talk about it is Democratic Congressman Luke Careya from Santa Anna. He serves as ranking member of the House Border Security Subcommittee. He reintroduced that legislation, and he's live in Washington tonight. Congressman, great to see you. Good evening. How you doing today? Doing well. If you can explain in the most simple terms, what exactly this immigration bill does? We're trying to simply keep them the American economy as the strongest as it can be. Make sure we check on inflation. We need workers. This is about keeping America strong. This immigration bill is as simple as it can get. A two-page bill simply changing the date of what we call the registry law. That was actually written in 1929. Everybody talks about all kinds of strange things hidden in bills. What we decided to do was immigration reform by changing a simple date on the registry, which is right now, anybody who came into the United States before 1972, before 1972, can apply for change of status. In a long time, 50 years. What we want to do is change that date to 2015. So anybody that came in before 2015 can apply for change and status. Can apply, meaning they still have to go through a rigorous background check. Make sure the night criminals, make sure they pay their taxes, follow the law, and then maybe they can apply and actually obtain a change in register in their status. All right. So people who hear this and these people may have gone through the legal immigration process themselves. We know it's a complex process. It's a very lengthy process. They hear this and they say, well, you know what? I had to do this and these individuals will essentially cut the line. What do you say to that? That's absolutely incorrect. A lot of these individuals have been here for 30 years. The problem is there is no line. You can't get in period. And what we want to do right now is give people a pathway to get in. Now remember, this is not just about farm workers today. 50% of farm workers are undocumented. You talk to Silicon Valley executives need those trained workers as well. So it's not about cutting the line. It's about getting a shot at those that have earned the opportunity to live in the United States legally. 25, 30 years in the US without any opportunity for change of status. That is absolutely wrong and it's un-American. Of course, there has not been major immigration reform in decades in this country because the last time we had immigration reform, Ronald Reagan was president back in the 80s. That's why even though right now we have Republican-controlled Congress, I'm hopeful that Republicans like Ronald Reagan stepped up, will step up today and help us keep the American economy the strongest in the world. Yeah, of course, the Republican calculus has changed a lot since Ronald Reagan. It might be difficult for him to get the nomination these days based off of the way the politics has changed. Let's talk about another issue that I know you're passionate about. This idea of a family detention for people that are coming across the border, there's been some talk about the Biden administration potentially bringing that policy back. I know that's something you're outspoken on. What's your take on all of that? I want to fix the refugee problem. Family detentions didn't work for Obama. They didn't work for Trump and they are not going to work for the Biden administration. What works? Ukrainian model. Ukrainian refugees were at our border in Mexico just a few months ago. They set up a camp. The Mexican government set up a camp for those Ukrainian refugees. They came in, got themselves checked out physically. Title 42 was way for them. They got what's called a parole permit to come into the Europe, their way into the United States. Today, if you go to Tijuana, Mexico, there aren't any Ukrainian refugees. You know why? Because now those refugees are coming directly from Europe to the United States. That situation, you didn't have family detentions. What you had is an orderly system of helping those refugees. We can. Yeah, I believe we have a little bit of a hiccup there on your Zoom signal, but I think you were saying we can do this. We can do it again. Yeah, we can do it again, even if we can't necessarily get the best Zoom signal. So, Congressman, thank you so much. We appreciate it. I think we got the key points there. Obviously, immigration is such an important and such an issue that arises so much passion and we appreciate you sharing your perspective. We'll continue to work for Main Street and for California. Thank you for your time and interest. Good to see you.",

So, next sa mga-preference natin, yung aling yung poyong mga generational-generation preferences, yung mga classic, primilenial, millenial, post-millenial, yung mga titos in tita sa paniladita, diba? So kung baga-parang, I always hear this, our generation have the best song, galo mpoyong mga sinisabiinla. Even sa amen, minisan na nababanggituyon sa asawakong, alamuyo yung anun natin, mag-mogandi mga kantan natin natin, daatik, kisay mga kantangayon. Parang akorinaw, huli ko rin poyong sarili ko nag-gano, and our generation is so simple, tapos contento lang, diba? Simpli lang, to contentos, nail-mails, nail-mail, mima post-office, ansayaslaya kayaanong, sumulat ng mga ganito-ganito, tapos, para may puso, e-mion email email, tapos purus pampa, diba? Our generation is so, our generation today, purulang lang internet, wala ng ginawa, ating muna manyo mga generation here, this are the millenials, parang makasama sila sa isang lugar, pero para makayuholay naman sila, periklamatay na nga kalamo about the internet, ang question ko po, siinapunagaplay ng internet? siinapunagubay ng internet sa bay natin, tayo rin po, okay? So, kung pagaparang, tayo rin mampuyan, okay? So, we have our preferences, but you know what, there's nothing wrong with preferences. Kasi, okay, puyan. Ndi po maganda, pareparehutayo lahat, pareparehutay ng cura, pareparehutay ng gusto, diba? It's preferences are good, but sometimes preferences can lead us to curses. It's because, hindi mo to preference, amang iarasa, you're gonna say something about your mga hindi mo gusto. You're gonna say something about your mga hindi mo typ, hang, it's because of your preferences, your own preferences, at least to curses. And sometimes, even in our generation, in our current generation, in what's happening in our current generation, nga yon. Sometimes, we say curses to this generation. Like, halba, pagkana ka kare nig putay na mga teen-age pregnancy, diba? When we hear teen-age pregnancy, aga, naman yung mga anong aayon, yung mga buba, grabi, grabi yung mga chantangayon, grabi yung mga yung people ngayon. When we hear, ay yung generation struggling with homo sexuality, grabi yung mga antimdino mga baatapalang, grabi, lan taran, ha? Genun minsan tayo, salita at mga iset, there's struggling with drug addiction, antimdino mga addict ngayon, ambabata. We have the 10, you see, something against them. And I, I heard this that the syndicates right now, are using the young generation to prevent it because I'm not going to be able to do it. So, you see, I, over, I heard some of the news and at the same time, the people who were watching my YouTube, when I was there, and my crime was 60 years old. Grabi naman, 15, 14 years old, and I was watching comments and it seems like I was in a hurry. Whenever I see the comments there, and you see, not just the government, not just the media, but at the same time, the media, the comments, the people who were watching juvenile delinquency, the criminal liability from 18 years old, they were doing 15 years old, to be able to do it. The kids, the students, the kids, and they were doing it. And that's it. So, you see, you see, you see, it's because these students, the kids, they don't have the right to do this, this generation, it's the worst generation, just, just, you put the mindset of it. Those things are cursing to them. Those things were, we're putting down the next generation. And let me tell you this, they found, they found a reason to do this. They found a reason, but you know what? As a church, that's not our only option. We're here to also pray for them. We're here to hold the rope for our next generation. And let's just look at the other side. Let's just look at the other side. Let's just look at the other side. This is the other side of the next generation. Here in church, what are the values of our children? I really appreciate the church. I'm here right now in front of you. I'm a product of campus ministry. I was reached out in a campus. It's thanks to Jante. There's no pag-asasabuhay. I'm not, I'm just a small. I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit, there's no hope. And yet, someone reached out to me. And I began to get a little bit, because God loves you. And it changed my life. I really appreciate this movement, this ministry, this church. Really for reaching out to the next generation, having heart for the next generation. And my hope in prayer for all of us here is that we will get that same heart, the heart of God, to reach out to the lost people in our campuses as well. So that's why today we're going to talk about the blessing of the next generation. We're going to talk about blessing them. So believing in them, calling out the great destiny for them. That's why I want to invite each and every one of us to please stand as we read the Word of God. Can we all stand up please? In Hebrews chapter 11 verses 20 to 21, by faith, I sought invoke future blessing on Jacob and Issa. By faith, Jacob, when dying, bless each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff. By faith, we will be able to see this. In the name of God, we will be able to see the right mindset of our people and the right heart of our people. And Lord, may He be pleased with our people. And we will see the next generation of our people. Thank God for the youth of our people. We're lifting them up to you. And I pray that you will change our hearts. I pray that you will be blessed with the heart of this. We have a lot of people in our hearts. Thank God, I bless them Lord. I thank you for your word. May you anoint the preaching of your work out. In Jesus name, amen. May you take your seat. Actually, this is the Hebrews chapter 11. When you look at Hebrews 11, when you look at the Bible, it's all about the whole faith. Meaning, when you look at the Bible, you see this. You see this. The Bible says, this is the faith. David did this. Now, these people are being commanded because of their faith. Can you imagine Isaac and Jacob were commanded for their faith because of the next generation? That's why, because they are all in faith. And something that I hope and my prayer for all of us here is that the Lord will say, when we see the light of your life, because you have the faith for the next generation. And you don't have to go to the world, you don't have to go to the world. Now, two things that we should be remanded for the next generation. Number one, is this. You only have two points. Number one, bless the next generation. Bless the next generation. Says here, by faith, Isaac and both future blessing on Jacob. And so it came, this verse came from Genesis 27, where the author of Hebrews got this. Okay? Sabi Pujan, when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could kill himself in Isaac, right? The one who was ordered to say, I'm not, I'm not saying that, because it's the one who was ordered to say, I'm not saying that, right? Sabi Pujan, okay? Divok, you're not saying that. See, Isaac was old, and he was very good. When Isaac was old, he was very good, he was a sacrifice. So, did I verse one, when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see. He called Eso, his older son, and he said to him, my son, and he answered, here I am, he said, behold, I am old. I do not know the day of my death, now then, take your weapons, your quiver, and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me. Can you imagine? You want to see the fire of the fire. Okay? I know what the fire of the fire is. And prepare for me, delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me, so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die. Actually, you can see that he bless me, that he is Isaac, Eso, immediately, because firstborn child, he is the firstborn son of him, but he is the one who blesses you. Don't, if you are a little older, but what is the request of your child? He said, you should give him a hug, if you are still young, you are not going to be able to promise him. Oh, I am not going to be able to promise him that I do not know. So, if you are still young, please, be patient like what you always do. Okay? If you are still young, then I will tell you, dito alang wakalan ako ng mama tayo pero please, awana, awana, kais yung pagguluto sa aking, okay? No, you know what, despite of Isaac's circumstances, he didn't withhold to give his blessing to his firstborn child. Kaya na mahi nga sa tanagit tinawag nya pa. He took time and effort para ko sa pitong anak nya para lang iblas. You know what, meansan para ng isip ko, ready naman siyang, ready naman nya sa bihin na ang takal ko ka yung pinagsilbyan, ang takal ko ka yung pinakain, pinag arel ko ko ka yung pero, kital naman, akunaman ng iblas nyo, akunaman matanda na ako ng ibegame mo naman sa aking but indeed, his attitude is always to bless. As yung sabi nya di ito, he took time, okay? To bless his son, right? So, let's continue the story, actually, yung story puyo nyan pagginan tinyo, puunaten. si Jacob, ang isapun ng anak, okay? Yung bunsu ng anak, kasi na o na si Iso, ngayon si Jacob na manyo sumunod. Okay? Si Jacob, nare niya sa nana niya, kasi yung mamina, may ro silang favoritis, e me, okay? Yung tatanya, preferens niya si Iso. Eto mamina na manya, preferens niya si Jacob. So ng overhead ng mamina, yung pida ko usapan na na lwag. So si nabinyong ang kak Jacob, Jacob Jacob, ay, Jacob Jacob, ay nang? Okay? Nare niya niya niya niya niya. Kasi ko, ikaw maka ko ng bless niya. So ikaw. So ngayon, ay kasi nabinyong tatanya niya. Kaya Iso, sa kawin mo ngayon. Ipaglutong mo, siya, tapos maglagig ka ng balbon. Kaya kasi balbon niya si Iso, yung nagagig ka ng mo ng confer. Nang sa ganon, paginawang ka nya, panwari, ikaw si Iso. Kaya ba? So ngayon si Jacob, ginowa niya yung sinabi sa kanya ng mamina. Ilepita niya pinaglutunya. Oh! Tapos ka niya niya niya niisak. Ngayon, saabinyo ikaw bata lagay na ko. Opo, tungmukon yung howakan yung kaya na ko. Yung brazo ko, oh, di ba? Balbon. Sabi na tatanya huli ka balbon. So... So ngayon, Jacob, the civis father isa. The civis nyangayon. So isa, indeed, the civis nyangayon. So, billes niya, billes niya yung future ni Jacob. Okay. So, when Iso discovered, paggating niya, Iso, luto na yung paggain na. So pinuntaan nya ngayon, at saabinyo. Daaggi. Eh, to na yung nebrewas mo sa akin. Talagang paulis na paulis. Saka, kasi na gan paul. Apo, supna-kui. Sinan pa kanya sa yung? Ampito palang ko. Kaya luto ko palang nato. Sabi na, na ria na isa niya. Hindi ikaw yunapakain sa akin. At na deceiver ako. Okay. But yunawat, after Jacob deceiver's father, yung dadi niya, hindi nilong voc yung blessing yung Jacob. Hindi niya sinabi. Magkurs yung si Jacob niya na maluloko, deceiver yung tao niyan. Desiver yung baka nayan. Desiver yung yung yung next generation ayan. Hindi niya sinabiyon. But, instead, ang ginawanya, asafiay, his own preference as he bless both of his son. He didn't revoke his blessing to Jacob, indeed he blessed him. But he bless both of his sons. Now, Anapuba yung word the bless. Yung bless is the Greek word of ulogyo, or ulogyo, okay. Which means, bring a good word or to confer a benefit. Okay? Now, such blessings were very important. Important to put up a para sa anila. Kayap putala gang pinagagawa nanda lwoy. Yung blessing yung word lang po, because this blessing, they address this to God. So, umbaga para nila, lapit pwanda na toko ay god. Talaga, yung ina-adresil na ang kagaglord, I pray that you will bless this person. And they view this blessings as the shaping of the future. Kung ano yung blessed ko dito sa anya. Kung ano yung siinabi ko sa anya, it's gonna shape his future. Eto na yung maghiging situasio na maghigim buhay na. And indeed, as they address it to God, it's happening in their lives. And even if you know, it's real, because it's not just the physical, it's all spiritual. Again, if we talk about the previous of the series, the make-room, it's the spiritual. It's all spiritual. The battle of spiritual realms. Okay? I know you will be able to see the future of my children. Whenever I talk to my daughter like two days ago, I will be able to see the future of my children. We will not see the future of my children. It's a little bit different from the future of my children. So, I will be able to see them. That's what I'm gonna do. But then, I will be able to see them. You know what? Ryan, you're gonna be great. You will have a great destiny. As we name you, re-and-destiny. You're gonna have a great destiny. Because God has something for you. You're gonna be a great leader and you're gonna be a blessing to this nation. You're gonna be, I always say that. Those kind of words. Even in my daughter's order, even in my daughter's belly, she's straight. Okay? She's straight. I bless them. When you look at her, you're gonna be blessed. You're gonna become a blessing to people. I spoke those blessings to them. It seems like you know what I'm gonna do. This is what I'm gonna do. This is what I want to do. And actually, it's something inside. There's happening spiritually inside of them. Now, are we like that to the next generation? When we see something, it seems like it's something that you're gonna do. Are we addressing it? And at the same time, I'm blessing them. Or you're not saying that. Some of us said these things. When you're in a relationship, you're gonna be like that. You're gonna be like that. You're gonna be like that. This is what I want to do. And you're gonna be like that. You're gonna be like that. You're gonna be like that. You're gonna be like that. That's the worst. That's the generation. That's the crisis. And some parents said something against their children. Some of us here, I mean, we're gonna push it out. And then, you're gonna be like that. You know what? There's no point. We think those kind of words are just simple. And then, we're gonna push it out. I'm just gonna push it out. It seems like there's no point. If you're gonna do something against your children, if you're gonna do something against your children, you're gonna be like that. Whenever, whenever, we're gonna be like that. Sometimes, we curse them. We say this negative curse is a them. When your child is being blamed, When your child is being blamed, Does that mean the children are the same and so do you. Then repeat. Repeat. It's照 60%. This why blev after this? See? It's so disinwas because your child was injured. It's better that her child lives on uterus. Did you see that she was injured? Yes. She Christians lambda the story from the police and then their mothers died after the accident. They were killed. magsumagatong anak ko, eka si- suma sa gut kapah!

Sipulagin na lang ako malibi sa bahin at malin na ako sa ganyaman, nak nak nak nak nak nak nak nak nak. Okita mo malin na naman ako, na. Wala na lang tama ako, ginowadi to, alo ba na manyan? So, doos ka na tank, bilibe ka maratisin na ng choy nganon ng kumpagab. Are we blessing them, or are we listening to them? Sa mga inanakit na, na meron sila. So that we understand and bless them, okay? This word has an effect on both physical and spiritual of a person. This can become a foothold of the enemy. Lalo ako yan. Pwede yung maging foothold ng enemy sa buhay nila. It's because whenever, marala punila to mga bagay na to, sabi nila, mga pala, wala ako ko, kumpag. Kong ngapalak, wala ako, so gagamiting ng yanon ang enemy sa kanya. Wala ka, nila. Diba si nabisay ng na na yung mo, bubulu ng anyan ang enemy. Diba si nabisay mo, belakadang nga dung mo. Belakadang magagawa, wala ako, nila ka nito, asakata, asakata. O mano, so meron sa kanilang mga karasilan ang something in their hearts. Actually, they have two kinds of responses when we look down on the youth. They young people. The ones of responses. Number one, they can become insecure and security. They will be hopeless in life. Parang wala, wala naka, wala naka, wala naka pa, ah, sa sabuhay na to. Like what I said earlier, nabuhay naka, mahirap, mga matay na ako mahirap. Pag nagaral, misan niya sa amen. I remember this, lumakipu ko, asya ako sa sana ang dress bukid. So, ngayon, one time, na ang English ang isang bata. Yes. Wow, parip ang English English pad, dumanon. Kaila mo na mana sa kapah. Susyel, susyel, ka jan, na gis lang. Minura pa. Amin, dos kanal, things. Gina na nagajong, bata, amin. Eh, to, bata na to. Okay, hindi pala ako kay lang magingan. Ito, kay lang pala mga harap lang ako na malikit. Gagang nabikam insecure. Pag tina na mo ang pangarap ko sa buhay simdala. Asa mga pagtapos lang, magapagano lang. Gina, okay. Duhan nabikam hablas, bakit. Ako nga dapatilay, blasay. Kasi, ito, kay lang ako na mga pakey, pakey. Whenever they look on people, parang. Po, hindi po. Why? Because we'll last a long dig in that. Because ang tingin, ang tingin, it's necessary to know mga baba. That's why hindi si nanda pro-progress in life. You're gonna think, baka ganyan ng mga pilipe, no? Pag mga lumakig, ganyan, semulapong nambatayon. The insecurity that has been planted in their lives. Pagalo, po rebelyon. Pong hindiyan mag-insecure mag-iging rebeld yan. They will try to prove something. Hindi mo nang-insecurean, when you say something sa kanila, gado niyang magpapatunayan. Papatunay ang ko sa yung hindi ako ganito. Bukas nuluhu da mga tala. Bukas mga kaita mo inay. I mean, they can become successful financially. They have their own business, but actually, they have hurts and hatred in their hearts, which is indeed naman tama. Down in mga pera, may mga coach ka, may mga ganyan ka. But the hatred sa pusumunan jamparen. Well, guess what? Finances. And mga maninayan, cars and houses, Hindi box-yum blessing sa ganyan. And down in mga pera, but at the same time, the heart man naman hindi ma sa yaha. Yang ayon mga kaita mo yung mga talo. And down in talo, ng ang yayaman na papakamata. Why? It's because they have this hatred. Gusto nilong mga patunay sa- sa muntunatomayan, ang gusto mga patunayan. Pag hindi ko na kami. Oh man, naman. Mga patakabata yung. Kayangan, meron, meron, kamakakita na yung mga sujante, na, si nabi ang babaw lang, bumag saklang sa mat na paka matay na. Bumag saklang sa exam na paka matay na. And guess what? Hindi yun yung punut dulu nung. Is the insecurity in them? Is the rebellion in their heart na parang... meron ng gusto mpa to na hindi ko na ko hain? There's something. In our words, then can shape the next generation. And they have the tendency to pass it, pass their hearts on their future family. Yung mga pamilyang nga kapanagapu. Liba, meron tayo mga marriage, problems, yung mga marital problems, wau, actually, hindi naman puta nga marital problem yung, nga marital problem yung believe that. It's a problem ng individual a-person na nada nada lang sa marriage. And galing yung sa paka-bata. Dung nga nada nada nada nada lalhat. But, yung mga marital, it's a different thing when you bless them and believe in them. It's a different thing when you bless the next generation and believe in them. I remember this story, and so vivid parin para sa akain. I want to be nig na akin na. This was, I think, four years ago. Naga, nga pungpunta pwa ako don, and then naga, naga, naga, be built to ako na relationship sa mga sajanti. Mga high school students puna natin don. And, nga nga nga nga pasok sa binig na akin na.

And, shinaragol sa kanila na, nga, you know what, there's hope in this life. Nipag asa, sa, sa buhay no. Wong nyo, isipin nagayon ng lang. So, nga, you know, I didn't share the gospel yet.

And my hope and prayer for all of us that, hina yung making selfish, simple five minutes, to bless them. Take time. They just speak a blessing to these people. Yes, marat nakakagawasilana mga malay. Yes, marami sila paka-amalay. Yes, nakagagawasilana mga cry, but you know what? It's different when we bless them, when we speak life to them. It's a different thing. I thank God for that. Number two point. In number one point puna tenis this. Bless the next generation. Number two point. So they can become a blessing to others. And well, bless the next generation so they can become a blessing to others. Sa be putito in verse 21 by faith, Jacob when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff. This verse came from Genesis 48. Okay? This is Genesis 48 verses 8-9. Sa be itito. When Israel saw Joseph's sons, see, see, and I put it here. See, Joseph, he became Israel. He was the only one who knew Israel. Because Joseph, he was the only one who knew Israel. He was the father of the eight tribes of Israel. He was the only one who knew Israel. Because Jacob was the only one who knew Israel. That means the receiver. So he was the only one who knew Israel. Sa be itito, when Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, who are these? Joseph said to his father, they are my sons, whom God has given me here, and he said, bring them to me, please, bless them. Actually, this is what Israel and Joseph knew about his sons. So, because he was the only one who knew Egypt, and Joseph was the only one who knew Egypt. So, he was the only one who knew him. For so many years, in the last years of Israel, Jacob was the only one who knew Joseph. So, he knew that he was the only one who knew him. And he said, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? Joseph said, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? What are you going to do? So, bring them to me, please, that I am the only one who knew them. Actually, Jacob received blessings from his father, Isaac. Israel was the only one who received blessings from his father. No, he don't deserve it, because the receiver, he received Isaac, the receiver, say. But then he received it, because he don't deserve it. That's why he experienced the goodness of his father. He didn't deserve it. He didn't deserve it. He didn't deserve it. He didn't deserve it. He didn't deserve it. And yet, he received the blessings. And actually, this is the story of the story. Let me offer forgiveness. It's a heart, nothing. Having a heart, we can bless the next generation. It's because we receive blessings from the Lord. Because he experienced the goodness of God. He experienced the goodness of his father, Isaac. He experienced the love and faithfulness and blessings of God. He believed in the next generation beyond his lifetime. Because indeed, he was blessed. As his father, Isaac, blessed him. He said, bless him, sobra, sobra. Actually, he had a heart, and yet, that's why he said, it's because of that, because of the blessings that he received, though he don't deserve it, he believed in the next generation. He believed in blessing the next generation. That's why he took time. Even though he was blessed by Israel, because he was blessed by Israel, I may bless them. The shaping of their future, I want to bless them. I want to bring them to me. He believed in this. Beyond his life, because he knows, he knows nothing. He knows, he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows. Actually, it's not true that for ever, even you who enjoy, feel assuming prayers for the good, even you who stand out front to eat, but one thing is foreshort, where you all have to live. There's nothing, that we want to see, that we have done so the past, that we have determined to live, that we have to take up the next generation. We have to think about our success. Even though they are able to deal with gisis manayan, if they don't have a success or they're not really successful. They're not. Because even if you are a man, if you are not successful, if you are a man, if you have a success or then you're successful, it's the same thing with us here. As Christians, are you racing up the next generation? Are you blessing them? The way God has blessed you, the way people reach out to you and bless you. Are you doing the same thing to them? Are we doing it? He believes that the future rest in the next generation. I want to show you a video. We're going to show you a video. And these people believe in the next generation because someone believed in them. Actually, it's our our campus missionaries, they're all the same. They're all the same. They're all the same. This is the 2018. The campus missionaries are all across the Philippines. They're all the same because they're all the same. They're all the same because they're all the same. So, the school of campus ministry is based on the 2018. So, they're like interviews. But they didn't even expect what they did to them. So, they just wanted to know about the heart of the next generation. What can you say about the next generation? And what we're going to say is that the school of campus is just like that. It's just that they're all the same. And what we're going to say is because I'm really happy about this. I'm really happy about this. I'm really happy about the next generation. Why? Because someone believed in them. Let's just watch this video. Okay. Are you ready? I'm ready. How do you realize these students? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. How do I feel? I'm a postman of post-oportalk. I'm my girl. When I see the students, I see the sons and daughters of God. They're all very deep back to Him. I know. It breaks my heart because a lot of them they don't know their purpose. They don't know their true identity. They settle for less with the wrong relationships and organizations. I was lost because of the purposes of the way. They don't know what God can do. Do I have to do it with my parents? I see them as a ship without a shepherd. They have a great future ahead of them, but some of them are really misaligned. Some of them are fighting for the wrong things. There are many philosophies that are being taught inside the campus. It breaks me. When they identify themselves as being part of the world. They don't know where to go. They don't know their direction in life. The same thing. The same thing that I told you before. The same thing that I told you before. Someone has to initiate that you are more than what you tell them. When you look at them and look at them in the lens, how God sees them. This is what happened to us. The whole world was destroyed. I was lost because of our own people. The whole world was destroyed because of Jesus Christ. Of course. That's why I was lost in the world. The love that you have to satisfy, the love that you have to give to your own children is to be created. I want them to know that I am excellent in God. It's seeing every student transformed by the gospel of Jesus Christ. I have to believe that God is the God's will. I have to believe that God is the God's will. Because it's Jesus Christ who is the God's will. To help the purpose of life. It will help them know that in this dark world, there is light. Even though we have struggles with our people, we have to be strong. When they realize that it's a daily walk, it's not a pressure to walk with Jesus. It really gives them freedom. We need to let them see who they really are meant to be. When I see students at the campus, I see our future society. Because when we reach out to one student, we reach out to their family. We can see that they are getting so strong. They are so strong. Can you imagine that we are also reaching out to the future families? I see a family that someday that family will be a blessing to the community. They would be a Christ-centered family with a mission. I see future leaders, I see world changers, I see future presidents, future senators, future doctors of this nation. They will be able to uphold God's will, they will be able to uphold the political foundations in those areas. We will have a nation and a generation with leaders that fears God, walks in integrity and leads with excellence. We are not only leaders, we are also leaders of God. I also feel that gladness that there is still hope in our nation, in our community, in our society. Not just being right in the society, but being right in God's eyes. The mindset that every day we do is a worship to God. I am so privileged to become an instrument to be able to get to know God. I feel excited and I feel assured that this is the call that God has been. This is the call that God wants me to do. God has so much plans for their future, and that is why we change the campus and change the world. My future post and ex-generation are in Tamil. We believe that church. Last story before we put in again. I met this person, he is a tall-aged boy, he is a leader, he is a tall-aged boy. He is a tall-aged boy because he is a schooler. I was born in University of Makati. Seven years ago, I thought there, until now, we were able to do a class when the leadership, integrity, faith, and excellence of our life. We were teaching them, they were not a full-time professor. But as a campus missionary for us to build relationships with these people, and teach them about life, and at the same time, we will return to our own home. So, what happened to your life? When I was a child, I was a graduate. This is what I said. I was a child. This is what I said. I was able to tell them, I was able to tell them that this was what I said. I mean, why? What's funny? I tried to tell them that they were giving them money. They were really talking about money. They said, they are really mocking this person. Why? And then I realized that I was able to tell them one time that I was able to tell them that I was able to tell them Ito ang Shadon, sa sabung sa kanya Ali, makat ka nag-iisadito. Haban niya, kasi. Lano ang gusto makapag-an sa kankasama sa kank. Bakit? Wala ka baka, ibygank, meron. Kayalang, dito na makalang kuntoto. Friends ko na manzila. Yung ay bak. Okay. Alam yung marami puwakong marami ako naging tanin sa klasin ng anang krabito na toli, dertong toon na toon. Ang goaapun na toon na toon na toon na toon. Pending, pending kami, deilor yan. Alam yung an, ang grupunato talagang leader talagang pending, at ang grupunato, we can just befriend with them and build a relationship. But I chose to go to this person and say, I wanna build a relationship to this person. And sabi ko kay ni Ito. Wala, wala ang gusto makapag-ibygank sa yung. You know what, I'm telling you right now. From this day on, I am your friend. Unto may yung parang, alam yung namulat yung sabi ngayon. Serios ako abang, segi ng ako among parang toto obayan. Yes, I wanna be your friend. And then we did want to one parapos sa mga indipun ako alam sa 6, 7 chapter booklet po. It's a walk, a, a guide dance, sa pagwakoon natin kay ka, and we did it. Ito po inin, vaikapos sa church natin, and then we're doing it. And at the same time, atopong tao nato, may insecurity sa buhay niya. Pero sa power timintalit yung parang ako nalang, ako, ako, ako, puro bighay na lang yung sabbatos yung instant, go tayo, go tayo. Pero tinan ang kong asya, bakit yung sabbatos mo ganyon, wala ka mo bilde, wala pa kasi na bibigay sa ako niya. Ha, yung damit mo ba ganyon. Kasi wala pa ng bibigay sa ako niya. Para lang, puro ako, ako, ako, ako. Pero tin, benrate na maman yung sabit sa mga kasi sa ang yayon you know what, bro? You're gonna'n beom aggressive at na zingma kasi调ila. You know what, bro? You're gonna'n beom applicationени kigga yung cover na nilong sa ang các roo, because God will bless you, and your design is not just to get and get, but your design to give to less agar peepon, because God will bless you tremendously. Naki tako siya na kapabang o. Naka ay siya na med. Hindi naman mo mo halingin sa patas, pero may bago siya ng mga patas. Naggulat ako. Habi ko. Pahagin sa patas mo. Bumili ako. Kain mo pala bumili. It's just a power to mindset in him. Meron ng mga pala. Kain mo mga pala. Naki tako sa kanya. Meron sa'ndalah. Sabi ko nangin dalang mo. Donuts. Dalang mga box ng donuts. Ang gagim mo yan. Ipapamigagyo sa pila. Bige sa ay no. I can become a blessing in the hero race. Do you know what I am doing? You're just a man. Kailangan ng yung mariniig yung mga nito kwasim ba? You know what, Silito? He became a great leader po sa ouringsuit service. Nag asher po yan. Naglib po yan. Tapos na wala po siya. Bige sa nagkatrabahu siya na putasyan ng batangas. Naging leader po punatis sa Victoria Lipa. Pero i-mot mo ang saan ang isang kampus mishinada sa abinya sa Aaron Bro. Kilalang mo ba tung tao na toa kanabi. Ok sa maglib. Ok sa mag-anuhata na kanagahin ako sa Silito. Oh, bro, it's one of our leaders here. And I know how. What a blessing na ming yari sa buhay niya. Thank you Lord for that. And you know what, nagvisit ako sa Facebook ng liito. Itin na kita ako sa kanya. I'll stay with you even if everyone leaves. What is the message of Jesus in his life? Ito parang yung nakata tak sa kanya. Kumpanggaparang lahat in yung yung nakong, pero ikaw yung nag-remain sa Akin Lord. Ikaw yung nak-bigay ng pag-asas sa Akin gan. Ikaw yung nak-bigay ng hope sa buhay ko gada. That's why even right now, ito yung tag ko sa buhay ko. It takes faith for us to bless the next generation. To look beyond the past. For us to look, it takes faith for us to say, may papupuntaan to tawa na to. Pag nakita natin yung mga yung people natin the next generation. Kaya ka ko na na pianas, please. The next generation, when we see them, ano ba yung nakagita natin, yes, hampanggaparang na ang panggapanggapang na yari sa buhay niya. But you know what, it takes faith for us to see beyond the past. For us to see beyond, what's happening right now, that this person will have a great future and will become a blessing to men. Ngayon lang yung yung ganyan, nakikita ba natin, yung future. We have to have the faith in the Lord, Lord, kaya mong baguwinta tao na to. So he can become a blessing to others. Marikas is an everyone of us. Please stand as we end. Alam yung post-Jisus Christ before pushai pawos ako. He was mocked. May iktawanan ka, minubung ka. He was beaten, pinakos sa pros. Ndipinapan wala an yung mga testimony, nesinabina. Kinyomat, ito nesinabipuni jisus. Paliwas nair nasa pros. Sabi nya. Inlook chapter 23 verse 34. And he said, father, forgive them, for they don't know what they're doing. Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. Jesus, despite his suffering, still calls to bless the people by forgiving them. Even though ito yung ganawasa kanyanan tao, he calls blessing to them despite of the circumstances. Despite the kanyanan sa kanyan sa aherop, he still calls for blessing for us. Lord, father, forgive them, did you know what they're doing? Lord, you know what? Because he knows that we are youth in the eyes of God. We are children in the eyes of God. But, we are all children in the eyes of God. And the thing is, you know what they're doing? Because he knows that only by receiving love and forgiveness that we can love other people as well. Because, he didn't know what he was doing. He didn't know what he was doing. He didn't know what he was doing. That's why Jesus initiated it. God initiated that love for us. That while we're sinners, he died for us. While we're still sinners, he actually made us even right now in the eyes of God. We're beating him. We're, we're, we're the one who's in front of us. And yet he said, forgiveness, blessing, blessing, only by knowing my love. You will love other people as well. Those people, the young people, the young people, the young people who are crying, the young people who are crying, blinded, you know what they're doing? They don't know, they don't even know what they're saying. They know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. It's like we're doing the same thing before we do this. We don't know what we're doing. We don't know that we're, we're suffering from the pain of our sins. We're doing what we're doing. We're beating him. We're not knowing that we're doing what we're doing. We're not knowing that we're doing what we're doing. Because you're not aware. Our hearts are countless. Those people are like that too when we see them. They're hurt. Because they experience hurt. But when they experience the love of God, when they experience the love of God through us, then they too can love people as well. They can change this nation. They can, they, they, they God can change their lives only by using us to love them. Blessing is not just box on finances, but through investing also. Some words not in Sayang Nila, are we blessing them? Are we speaking life to them? It's a heart Nila. Lord, we'll lift you our next generation. We'll lift you even right now, you're the ones who are with us. We want changes, Lord. We want to change the wrong mindsets of these people, the outside world, Lord. Not just here, God. We want to be blessed with God. We want to be blessed with God. If we have wrong mindsets, and we, we, we curse them, if we're the one who curse them, Lord, we repent. We want to speak blessing to them. We want to call a group of people here. If you're here now, you're here to live in the same way. You're here to hurt the young person, the person who has a very good generation, you said something to them, maybe you're just going to be here, and you're just a curse to them. You're just a list of them, but you're missing your impact on them. If you're here, let's pray. Lord, I pray. For us, the older generation, Lord. Lord, God, we repent from what we said. And God, we renounce the negative words, the purses that we said for the next generation. Lord, right now, we lift them up to you, God. We're saying, we're speaking blessing to them. We're calling out the destiny, great destiny, Lord, that you want for them, God. Lord, I pray that you will put it always in our hearts, and remind us always to think for the next generation, Lord, God. Marami salamapok, and we want to repent and say, oh, Lord, we don't want to do it again. Guide us, God, in Jesus' name. For the young people here, you should ask them, the young generation. There you go. Teenagers, you know what I'm saying, right? You can ask them, we'll put our generation together. The young generation, if you have hurt from the past, even from your parents, from your parents, from your parents, or from your older parents, from your heart, they spoke blessing, they spoke herses against you, and means to them to give you. I want you to forgive them. We're going to pray this prayer. Lord, I pray God for forgiveness in our hearts. We'll be able to forgive the older generation from what they said, or the person who has been in the Lord, we forgive them, Lord, God. We put it on your feet, God, and say, Lord, I want to thank them for what we have done. Thank you, God, because forgiveness is not for them. It's for me. Thank you, Lord. Lord, God, I pray, I speak blessing to these young people, the next generation leaders. I pray God that you will raise them up, Lord, as leaders of this nation, Lord, leaders of their family, God, that they will do the right thing, God. I pray that they will stand on what is right, Lord, God. They will stand on the truth, and that is the gospel, which you have laid down two thousand years ago, God. You died on the cross, and paid the penalty of their sins, of our sins, God, and I pray, God, that they will be reminded of your love for them, so that they can become a blessing to other people, because as we bless them, God, they will become a blessing to other people as well. Lord, Maraming Salam, for this next generation, I pray for great future for them, for great things, Lord, that will come ahead of them, God. I speak blessing for them, God, not just in this generation, not just in the next generation, God, but for the generation after the next generation, Lord, God. It will pass on Lord, God, it's because they can bless others as well, God, as they receive your blessing and your love for them, God. Maraming Salam, for in Jesus' name and prayer, and everybody say, Amen.",

Is it even better for you, man? It's crazy. I don't even remember what I did. The celebrations and everything. I just blacked out. I hit the ball. I'm like, I blacked out. Have you watched it? Have you gone back to watching on TV? No, I haven't. I can't wait. You never watched it. It's been non-stop since we won the award. No, stop. I would have not even been past second base before I was looking at it on the internet to watch it again. I got a sense of watch it yet. Yeah, well, it's pretty good. You're going to be happy, I think. I agree with you. People are talking about the celebrations and the fist bump and everything. I'm like, I don't remember any of that. Like, you don't really blacked out. Do you remember getting engaged? Because this could be a problem. That could be a problem, I'd be answering if I don't remember. The answer is right here. I don't remember. This is Daniel. My. Congratulations to both of you. Thank you. Gailiella, did you know he was going to do it? Did you have any ideas that was going to happen? No idea. I mean, he had been so focused on all these games that the last thing I ever thought would be on his mind was proposing to me. That's why I like yanked that gate out of my way. He turned the World Series into the Bachelor or all of us. How much planning went into this? Well, it was like, for the whole month, I've been planning it. But I knew we had championship colorate teams. So I was winning it out to see how far we could go. And then in game six, I had their ring ready. In my backpack, I'm like, this is the night. This is the night. We lost the game. I'm like, oh my gosh, one more game. I don't have plan B, so we better win. Because I don't know how to do it. So we have to win the game. And I want to say what they were doing for both. So my beautiful fiancee. Did it ever occur to you that maybe Daniel might say no? It was that ever a possibility? I think he knew I was going to say yes. That's why he took such a big risk. I mean, live television. Thank you, Daniel. If the Dodger said one, would you have married one of them? No. No. Will you guys get married on a baseball field? Will you consummate your love on a baseball field? Somebody asked me when we were getting married. And I said, when are we in the worst series again? So if it's 10 years, we got to wait 10 years to get married. No, I just kidding. I'm just kidding. I know you're kidding. It's hurt that doesn't know you're kidding. She gave me that face. She gave me that face. When do you get your World Series ring? Now we get it in opening day next year. Opening day next year. And did you ever consider, oh, maybe I'll just give her that ring? And she might have lost that chance. I got a long time for that ring. So I thought that was the perfect chance for me to get engaged. So I had to do it right. What have you been doing over the last five days? Take me through a little bit. So you had a parade, obviously. Yeah, we had the beautiful parade in Houston. People there, the support was incredible. I saw people crying there because obviously people have been through tough times in Houston. Right. And for us to be able to bring joy and happiness to a base, but he meant everything to us. There were people crying here in our way, too. Ah, yeah. Well, that's the moment that I'll forever remember. That people crying and streaming out of their lungs, it was such a special moment. It's overwhelming when you realize. It is. Because you come to a team, you never know what team you're going to get signed. And you see these people have been following this team for so long and how much it means to them. That it realized like there was a really big burden on your shoulders. Yeah, absolutely. And you know, Houston's like my second home. I'm from Puerto Rico, obviously, Puerto Rico. I look up. I'm back. So I was doing it for both. The people in Houston and the people back home in Puerto Rico. What was going on in Puerto Rico? Were people able to watch the games while you were playing? Actually, Puerto Rico had a curfew. And I think nobody cared. Everybody went outside to watch the games. And everything else getting texted from my family. And everybody's like, everybody's going outside to watch the games. They're going to sports bars and stuff to watch you play. It's amazing. So I really want to thank everybody for Puerto Rico for their support. Yeah, really. Where are you? Where are you guys registered? In case Astros fans want to send you gifts. We're not registered yet. You're not registered yet. Are you going to register? Will this be something that you do? I actually heard that some other couple has done it. So I told this agent, I'm like, we need to look into that. I'm not worried. Chris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs Registered, he did not know that it would be public information. And then all of a sudden, he and his wife got a whole bunch of stuff from people. I guess you can just say that we didn't know either. Well, give it a go. We'll do my awesome. Yeah, gifts are always nice. May I ask you a question about your teammate, Jose Altuve? He is listed at How Tall. I think he's listed at 5'7\". OK. I heard 5'6\". But how tall are you? 6'4\". OK. How tall is it? Like, when you guys went, I think you had a parade at Disney World. Was he allowed on the rides? LAUGHTER He was. He was. Yeah, absolutely. How tall do you think he is? Well, it depends. With cleats or without cleats? Without cleats. Without cleats? I think he's like 5'5\". But you think he's that tall? Yeah, it's his. See, if I was him, I wouldn't exaggerate my high. I wouldn't make myself like 4'9\". And it really be an inspiration to... I know. But I'm 6'4\". And I wish I could hit like him. He's sent on Bollywood hitter. Yeah, me too. I mean, he is an unbelievable hitter. Well, congratulations to you and to your fiancee on your rock series. And also, your love. You... Not only did you break a lot of hearts here in Los Angeles, I think you broke a lot of women's hearts all across the country. But... Thank you, come by. It's great to have you here. Carlos, Korea, everybody. We're on Series Champions.",

        "transcript": " My brand, as somebody who tells people things they don't want to hear. So let me start by telling you something you don't want to hear. Stop trying to ban books, okay? Stop it. If you want to be the free speech party, if you want to speak out for free speech and free expression, don't try to ban the Citer House rules or get it out of school libraries or confessions of that turner. Don't do it. If you like free speech, if you stand for free speech, you have to stand for free speech, even if you don't like what's being said. And that is what the left has completely forgotten. More and more day by day, week by week. Censorship never works. It always fails. It fails strategically because it tells the people you're competing with that your ideas don't work, which is why you can't debate them openly and freely. And it fails tactically because it gets people in the middle who may not have ever heard of the idea you're trying to ban. Interested in it, this is famously called the Streisand effect. It's always been true and it's more true than ever. So don't stand for censorship. Censorship is un-American, it's unconstitutional, it's wrong. And besides the left is way ahead on it. The left loves it, so let the left have it right now. It's really amazing to me in the last five years how far the left has gone on censorship. Most stunning, only two weeks ago, the Department of Homeland Security put out a bulletin where it defined terrorist threats as misinformation or disinformation about COVID and election fraud. And I want to read to you exactly what the Department of Homeland Security defined as a terrorist threat two weeks ago. If you make statements that, and I quote, undermine public trust in government institutions to encourage unrest, which could potentially inspire acts of violence, you may be a terrorist. OK, I'm a terrorist by that definition. And that means that the government is entitled to do lots of things to me if it actually defines me that way. That is wrong. And by the way, this definition could easily be applied to plenty of people on the left who spoke out in favor of the Black Lives Matter protests. This is dangerous to both sides. It's dangerous to the United States. DHS should walk away from it. And journalists should be asking about it. But they don't want to because they're so in love with squelching debate right now. The people who I used to work with at the New York Times have never said a word about this. I find it stunning and so disappointing. And across the border in Canada, people who donated money to a protest that was truly mostly peaceful, essentially entirely peaceful, had threatened by the Canadian government that they would have their bank accounts frozen, that they would essentially be shut out of life for donating to a peaceful protest. That is suppression of speech. It is wrong. And one week ago, people in the federal government spoke out against a website called Zero Hedge, which had committed the crime of publishing some stories that the Biden administration did not like. And they said Zero Hedge might be an agent of the Russian government. We are at a very strange moment when this stuff is happening and the traditional defenders of free speech are not speaking out about it. So that's the government acting directly, but the government is also acting indirectly through big tech, which I know Ron DeSantis spoke about, Governor DeSantis. And I felt like he was speaking to me as he was talking about how big tech sensors because last year at this convention, I said, hey, Twitter has been good. Twitter has allowed me to speak. And I've said things about the vaccines. And I've said things about COVID that the mainstream narrative goes against. It goes against the mainstream narrative. And Twitter has allowed me to do that. And then in July, I said something that Anthony Fauci didn't like. And less than a month later, I was off Twitter. Twitter had banned me. And that is big tech censorship. At its worst, Twitter is doing this. Facebook is doing this. We know Facebook pulls groups. Sometimes with hundreds of thousands of people, this has to stop. These companies have held themselves out as public forums. Twitter, Jack Dorsey, who was Twitter's founder, and until very recently, Twitter's chief executive said, under oath to the Senate that Twitter was a public square, this is not a public square if you have used that people don't like on the left. You get banned. They shouldn't do this. And whether or not they can do it constitutionally as a question. Hopefully that the Supreme Court will eventually get to decide. I've brought a lawsuit against them. Former President Trump has brought a lawsuit against them. One of these suits is going to get to the Supreme Court. And Twitter may not like the outcome. Because I'm not backing down. And I'm sure President Trump is not backing down. But it's about more than me or him or any one person. It's about whether these huge, incredibly important American companies are going to live up to their promises to allow free speech and open debate. And they are not doing so. So I have 30 seconds left. And I hope next year when I'm back here speaking to you, you'll be able to see what I have to say on Twitter. And I hope we'll all be able to debate our response to COVID and Ukraine and everything else on Twitter and Facebook and these platforms, they should live up to their ideals. They should live up to our country's ideals. And they should be open platforms for free speech. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a power play. Please welcome former Alaska Commissioner Kelly Chabaca. Thank you. I'm Kelly. Kelly Chabaca. I'm born and raised in Alaska. The woke leftist tried to cancel me before there was cancel culture. When I was an outspoken conservative at a liberal law school, the leftist posted death threats against me in the student center. But they couldn't cancel me. I won't be bullied. I won't be silenced. And I won't be controlled. But make no mistake, the radical progressives want to wipe out diversity of thought and a nation divided will not stand. Our founders created a government designed to be of the people, by the people and for the people. One is supposed to function like the seven referees of a football field. They regulate the plays and they call the fouls. But right now we have 700 referees on the field. And they're fouling us all over the place when government grows, freedom shrinks. And for me, this has become very personal. My parents moved to Alaska before I was born to pursue an American dream. But life doesn't always go according to plan. And they ended up becoming homeless. But my mom, she got a job in the oil industry. And with that oil job, they were proud to fight their way into working class America. Yes, I'm proud of them too. I got to be the first in our family to pursue a college education. And then I dedicated my career to public service, making government work for the people. I'm an anti swamp bureaucracy whisperer. I've exposed waste fraud and abuse, cut costs, and my favorite, held government insiders accountable. I was focused on my job, my church, my amazing husband, and being an Alaskan mom, educating five kids during COVID. Yep, shout out to the parents. And then Senator Lisa Murkowski. You all could be Alaskan. She cast the tie breaking vote to confirm the radical environmentalist Deb Holland to be Joe Biden's interior secretary. And with that single vote, Murkowski killed thousands of oil and gas jobs, just like the one my mom had. I felt it like a kick in the gut. I owe everything to Alaskan and to all those Alaskans who came around my family to give us those opportunities that we had. But Lisa Murkowski, well, she owes everything to her dad, who appointed her to his vacant Senate seat when he was elected governor. For the Murkowski, it's a little bit like the British royal family. In the same way that Queen Elizabeth is going to hand on that crown to a descendant, their Murkowski's have been handing down our Alaskan Senate seat like a birthright for 41 years. But nepotism breeds a lack of realism. So Murkowski, she doesn't feel it when she votes to confirm Joe Biden's radical nominees, like she's done over 90% of the time. She doesn't feel it when she acts as Joe Biden's CEO, his chief enabling officer, voting along with Biden's radical agenda and Bernie Sanders, a majority of the time, which hurts Alaskans and everyone in this room. She even voted for the Green New Deal, you know, the infrastructure bill. Murkowski didn't just vote for it, she helped write it. It is time to hold these leftist supporting insiders accountable. And aren't we all excited that come this November? We are going to block Biden's business busting, border bungling, crime cascading, defense decimating, energy annihilating, gun grabbing, gender jumbling, liberally loathing, mandate, militating, parent punishing, police persecuting, social supporting, America obliterating, agenda. We have inherited a great country because of veterans like my dad and others who have paid a significant cost. And they walk in the footsteps of those who signed the Declaration of Independence and they pledge their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. I believe that to whom much is given, much is expected. So I'm not standing on the sidelines. Well, Joe Biden and Lisa Murkowski and their woke leftist friends continue to obliterate the state and the country that I love. No. I'm all in. Yes. And today, I'm inviting you to be all in with me. Because it is time for Americans with courage and common sense to rise together and lead us forward. I'm Kelly Chabaca and I'm for Alaska. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, from North Carolina, representative Mark Walker. Thanks everybody. What a privilege to be here today. Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain, for purple mountains, majesty above the fruited plains. Written words of a young schoolteacher making her way across the plains in 1893. America the beautiful. We are a beautiful country, but our real beauty is in the fact that we are a beacon of freedom for the rest of the world. Think about it. America is the most philanthropic country and is always the first to arrive with disaster aid. We have 25% more foreign-born citizens than any country in the world. We send missionaries to share the message, the gospel message of hope and healing of Christianity across the world. And we take in one million legal immigrants every single year that raise their right hand to the oath and take it a legion to the Constitution. And we celebrate that they are as much Americans as you and I. Do we believe America is beautiful? Yes we do. Hey, listen. I'm not saying that we get it all right day one, right? But America is exceptional because we never quit trying until we became the land of opportunity for every American. A republic, if you can keep it, Ben Franklin said, well, we are the longest lasting republic in the history of the world. Do you believe America is beautiful? Dang straight we do. But freedom also has a price. Get his berg. Go out of canal. Normandy. I would ever forget standing on the grounds and looking down at Omaha Beach and across the Atlantic Ocean and realizing that D-Day wasn't won by great military generals or superior air cover. No, it was won by 18 and 19 year olds that kept charging up that hill wave after wave to make sure that those freedoms would be passed down to another generation. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you today, do you believe that America is beautiful? Absolutely we do. Over the last few years, leftist radicals are better named Democrats in Congress. They're no longer trying to hide their motives. So I'll change. Their attack to erode our liberty is supported by big tech, the press and the media. And now even corporate America has gone woke. Remember the words of Democrat James Clybert about COVID? Never let a crisis go to waste. In fact, COVID was used to fast-track mandates like no other time in history. Listen, they even changed our election laws and used it to test us to see how much liberty Americans were willing to give up. And frankly, I think even the left was surprised by just how much liberty we were willing to surrender. They will never stop trying to steamroll conservatives, folks like you and me. Today, we face a new kind of evil. The battle for freedoms in the 21st century is as much spiritual warfare as it is political. Do you believe that? Absolutely. When Democratic members of Congress vote, literally vote against sustaining the life of a baby that somehow survives a bunch of abortion, my friends, that's evil. When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris give the green light to illegals, when they know their children will be trafficked and assaulted by drug cartels, my friends, that's evil. In America, we have turned our backs on the Bible and the Constitution and we've lost our moral compass. But today, don't lose hope. Because here's the good news. Joe Biden and the left have overplayed their hand in Americans or waking up and engaging like never before. I'm meeting people who wanted it just to work hard to go to church, to raise their families, they're waking up and settling up as well. In fact, moms across the country are taking down leftists on school boards right and left and we celebrate that, right? Indeed, we do. Listen, ladies and gentlemen, it won't be easy. There's a price for liberty. There always has been. Question is, what are you and I willing to pay for it? America the Beautiful. You see, there's another verse to that song that we don't sing very much these days. A beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life. America, God shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea. My friends, one last time, do you believe America is beautiful? Yes, we do. May God provide the path and may we have the courage to follow. I'm Mark Walker. God bless you and let's keep the fight alive. God bless. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome U.S. Army Combat Veteran Corey Mills. Thank you. Thank you. How are we Orlando? How great is it to live in the freest state in America? But we're only free because of tremendous leadership by Governor Grande de Santis, the man who beat and defeat Fouchism and shows America first. The same as President Trump did when President Trump stopped out socialism and who is the true elected, not selected, President of the United States. How many of you remember when President Trump was elected, when they talked about the fact that he will be the beginning and start of World War III. But what did we see? We saw more peace accords, more conditions based with draw to these never-ending wars by the Neocons and those who are trying to prop up this military industrial base that we were warned about. Now what do we see? We see Joe Biden and America at the weakest national security we've ever faced in our lives. What do we have? We have the failed withdrawal in Afghanistan where thousands of Americans were purposely left behind. And how do I know this? Because my team and I conducted the very first successful overland rescue of an mother and her three children out of Afghanistan after the fall in the Taliban hunting them down. I pause my campaign for six weeks and why? Because there is no price to doing the right thing. What do we see in America today? We see North Korea with hypersonic ballistic missiles, Russian technology advancing. China has now surpassed us with a naval fleet threatening Taiwan. And now we have the Russian invasion, or I should say, the re-invasion because the exact same thing happened under the Obama Biden administration. They annexed Crimea. They took over Don Yetsk and yet were supposed to be surprised when they go back because they see the weak and woke administration under the Biden administration. General Milley spent more time looking at critical race theory, but he should have been opening a book on how to win wars. And what do we have now? We have veterans who are being turned away. We have a military purge and an unconstitutional vaccine mandate. A mandate that should not determine if you serve our nation or if you are able to go to work and put food on the table for your families. Let me be clear, I am not for wokeism. I am not for critical race theory in our educational and military systems. I am not for unconstitutional vaccine mandates and masking of our children. As a father, it is shameful when I watch kids have to go to school and be taught that America is bad. How many of us feel that America is the best nation on earth? And let me tell you what else I support. As a constitutionalist and a conservative first and Republican second, I support things like constitutional carry and are inalienable rights to protect our families and protect our homes. These aren't things that our government limited rights. These are God-given rights. But let's be clear about what we see as well. People rights are more important than a woke teacher union. As parents we know that. So as we stand here today in the great city of Orlando, never forget what we stand for because today is the time that patriots must rise. Today is the time that we look at what Isaiah says in the Bible when God called and said who shall I send and who shall go forth? It is us who shall say, here am I, send me. I want to thank you all. I want to thank this amazing state. I want God bless you. God bless our families. God bless America. And that's why I'm running here for Congress and Florida's seventh district to take back our country. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome former governor of Missouri, Eric Gritans. Well, good afternoon, patriots. We have a mission. And the mission is to take our country back. And we're here to do it. When I served as a Navy SEAL and I took an oath to defend our Constitution, it was an oath to protect the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And right now, despite the mainstream media lies and rhino cowardice and corruption, you know and we know and we see the true nature of the enemy that we are facing and the fact, the brutal fact is clear. The left is actively trying to destroy our country. We know the truth. We'll let the word go forth this afternoon from all of you who are standing here that we are going to stand for our country and we're ready to fight for it. I've been down to the border, not just to Texas and to Arizona, but to the Mexican side of the border. And I've seen the 600,000 to million people that are crossing our border every single month. That is an act that is making America weaker and our adversaries stronger. They are trying to destroy this country. When you look at what they have done with the defund the police movement and the horrific rise in murders around this country, they are trying to destroy our country. When you look at critical race theory, you can see they are trying to divide our country. When you look at the COVID tyranny and the assault on our liberties, you can see that they are trying to destroy our country. When you look at inflation, when you look at the military disasters and places like Afghanistan and Biden's policy of weakness and chaos that leads to aggression like we're seeing in the Ukraine, you can see that they are trying to destroy our country. And a lot of folks in the mainstream media, some rhinos, they might say, well, you know, I mean, this is just because Joe Biden is senile and Kamala Harris is incompetent. And that's true. They are. But it's more than that. But it's more than that, folks. No one is this stupid. No one leaves behind billions of dollars of military equipment for the Taliban, but that's what they did. And we must stand together to recognize the nature of the enemy. We are in a fight for the soul of our country. And it is a battle against evil. It is a battle against cruelty and it is a battle against tyranny. And we have to recognize that the left's policies are rooted in cruelty. You go down to the border right now. Joe Biden and Mexican drug gangs and cartels are involved in the largest human smuggling operation in history. And it's happening on our border and that is cruel. We talked to one customs and border patrol agent who told us about one kid who'd been sold 17 times. You talk to the families, the thousands of families around this country who've lost loved ones to violence because of the left's insane defund the police movement that is cruelty. You think about what's happening for families who've had kids with disabilities kept out of school for a year. That is cruelty. The left is cruel. And it is also tyrannical. You look at their assault on our liberties. Their assault on the First Amendment. Their assault on the Second Amendment. You look at the left's assault on our elections and on election integrity. You look at what the left is doing, the way they now and we know they spied on candidate Trump and they spied on President Trump and we know the truth. And we see around the country the George Soros funded assault on the rule of law. That's the nature of the enemy that we are facing. And when you look back historically what you see is the same thing that our founding fathers saw. The nature of leftism is that it never stops. They always progress to more and more tyranny. You can look at the Jacobins and the French Revolution. You can look at Lenin and Stalin. You can look at Mao in China, Pol Pot in Cambodia. Those who ride the tiger of tyranny. They keep progressing to more and more oppression because they know that if they step off the tiger will eat them as well. So the fact is the left isn't going to stop. And you have to make a choice. We have to make a choice. Are we going to stop them? And I will tell you that right now we know patriots around this country rising up and we're saying we are going to stand for our country and we're going to take it back. And this country will not be taken back by rhinos. It will be taken back by America first patriots who are willing to stand with courage and faith to make sure that we can pass on to our kids more than we inherited. There is a stark choice facing our country at this moment. And it is a choice between surrender to leftist cruelty and tyranny. Or the revival of our republic with freedom and faith and courage. And I am here to stand with you for the revival. Thank you. God bless you. I appreciate your courage. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, from the National Rifle Association, please welcome Wayne Loppier. Thank you very much. And thanks to all of you for being here today. You know, every where you look, you can see Americans all over this country are worried about the direction our country has headed. Americans are sick and tired of watching our time-honored American values like freedom, honesty, integrity, the rule of law being reduced, ridiculed, and replaced by politicians who deal in lies, who see integrity as weakness, and who frankly don't give a damn about your freedom or the rule of law. Seriously, I mean, you want an example? Look no further than the guy that right now occupies the White House. Earlier this month, in an event to honor two courageous New York City police officers who were murdered by a violent felon, Joe Biden shamelessly used the opportunity to push his gun band agenda. He went up there and he called for a band on semi-automatic rifles. He called for a band on Standard Capacity Magazine. He called for a band on private gun sales. And he called for suing America's firearms manufacturers into the ground and out of business. The one thing you didn't hear him call for at all is the one thing that could have saved those officers and helped them return home to their families that day. You didn't hear Joe Biden once call for putting violent criminals behind bars where they hauled along. He didn't want, not once, mentioned at the monster who killed those officers was a violent felon out on parole when he should have been in jail. Instead, what Joe Biden did is he set there and shamelessly looked right into the camera and he pointed his finger at you and me and he blamed us and our second amendment for it. This is the same Joe Biden who serves as a national cheerleader for pro criminal policies and you know what I'm talking about like no cash bail. It's the same Biden who wants to get rid of mandatory minimum sentences and it's the same Joe Biden who refuses to get serious about prosecuting felons who violate federal gun laws and instead he just lets them go free. Make no mistake Joe Biden's radical agenda to help violent criminals escape justice is only going to make deadly crime and the way that is across our country right now spread farther and deeper into more communities all over our precious country. But no matter how hard Biden tries to blame us for the violent crime that he enables, I'm happy to report that Americans who are all over this country aren't buying into his agenda. You know what they're doing instead? They're out there in record number buying guns. Last year, 5.4 million Americans purchased a firearm for the first time in their lives. And you know why? Because all of them can see what's happening all around them in their country and they want to be able to protect themselves and they want to be able to protect their families. They see, forget the paper and they see the daily news stories of another violent robbery, another heinous murder in another part of their community that they always thought was safe. And they know that Joe Biden and his anti-gun allies care more about protecting criminals than protecting those law-abiding Americans. You know, I don't know if you saw this but in a recent news story, I don't know if Los Angeles, California, a small gun shop owner in Beverly Hills of all places reported a huge increase in business from the folks you'd least expect. Movies stars, film executives, Hollywood bigwigs, more and more and more of them were sneaking into his shop and secretly buying guns. You're probably the same actors who buy a gun one day and the next day they go out in a rail against you and me and our second amendment rights. You know when you think about it, maybe that's why so many celebrities are out there pushing so hard for mask mandates. They don't want anyone to recognize it when they sneak into the gun store. And if any of those Hollywood hypocrites are watching right now, as we sit here, I have the message for you. No matter how much you attack us, belittle us, or try to shame us for exercising our second amendment rights, the men and women of the National Rifle Association will fight for your right to keep in bear arms just as hard as we fight for ours. Because this freedom belongs to all of us as Americans. And even though we're facing off against the anti-gun White House, Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer, I'm proud to report that NRA isn't just holding the line for freedom, we're advancing it. Every time Joe Biden has tried to ram through his gun band agenda through Congress, he's running into a brick wall of NRA members. Remember, and you will remember this, everyone's talking about it, when Biden nominated the gun band lobbyist David Chipman to head up ATF last year, Chipman would have used his position of power to lay waste to our gun rights in this country. Every so-called expert at the time said Chipman's confirmation was a done deal. There was nothing anybody could do about it, they all said. Well, they sure got that wrong. NRA went out and led the fight to stop Chipman's confirmation. And when the dust cleared by God's we won. And he went down to defeat. We also have taken the biggest second amendment case in over 10 years all the way to the Supreme Court. You'll be just excited probably in June. This landmark case is going to decide whether every law abiding Americans' right to self-defense stops at their front door or if it exists outside of their home. And thanks to the men and women of the NRA, you're right to carry a firearm for self-defense in this country is now legally recognized in 42 states and counties. Because now more than ever, especially in Joe Biden's America, every law abiding citizen should have the God given right to defend themselves and their loved ones, no matter where you live in this country. I want to conclude by saying I can't tell you what an honor it is to be here with all of you today and what an inspiration all of you in this conference is. I know you're here today because when you get worried about America, you don't just shake your head and your fist and scream at the wall. You educate yourself. You take action. You lead and you go out and fight back. I've seen you do it year after year and never forget that your voice resonates far beyond this room. And when you're an NRA member, it resonates even farther, carrying the weight of millions of NRA members and tens of millions more Americans who support our cause and look to us for leadership in defending freedom. So from where I'm standing right now, I ask you, join us. Join millions, millions of your fellow patriots across this nation by joining the NRA. Join the most successful civil rights organization in the history of our great nation. Join because you pledge your allegiance to the principles of freedom, not politics. And join because your right to self-defense is more sacred right now than any other right you possess. And join because there has never been a more important time to saddle up and ride with the National Rifle Association. Thank you. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Hey, let's keep fighting every day. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Senator Ted Cruz. God bless, see back. Not an amazing sight, thousands of patriots and not a damn mask in sight. Obviously, everyone here is just following Stacey Abrams example. We find ourselves at an existential moment for our nation. The threats in our country have never been greater. So I want to do something a little bit unusual for CPAC. I want to step back and go a little more philosophical and ask what is this battle all about? Where are we fighting about in this nation? And I'm going to suggest that the fundamental conflict that is playing out across this great nation is a battle between power and liberty. The two are in fundamental conflict. We are seeing it every day, vaccine mandates versus doctors and nurses, mask mandates versus kids in school, Spotify versus Joe Rogan. Go fund me versus Canadian truckers. Justin Trudeau. Let's pause for a second and observe that is the first time in recorded history that any Canadian has ever elicited that much of a response from any crowd on planet earth. Justin Trudeau and the God fearing Canadian truckers. The New York Times versus Barry White. Levi's versus Jennifer Say. AOC versus damn near anyone who ever dared to criticize her. Although actually as she told us if you criticize her, it means you really want a date. If you look at this battle, this is not a battle between the weak and the strong. Joe Rogan has many things but he ain't weak. Major League Baseball which went after the voters of Georgia, the Georgia voters are many things but they ain't weak. The Biden Department of Justice when they went after parents. Parents or many things but they ain't weak. Just ask loud in county. Just ask Terry McCullough. Just ask all the left wing Democrats in Virginia who are scared out of their minds right now. You gotta understand what is playing out here. What is playing out is the powerful are afraid. They are terrified of you. They look out at the men and women in this room and you scare the living crap out of them. They are afraid of truth. They are afraid of liberty. That fear is driving. The Lee suggests a principle, a very simple principle for conservatives to understand. Big is bad. Across the board, big government sucks. Big business sucks. Big tech, big Hollywood, big universities. Any accumulation of power that is centralized is fundamentally dangerous for individual liberty. What is it that the Communists want, the Communists want control of everything, they want centralized power? How do we ensure freedom? The principles I'm talking about were said far more eloquently, far more elegantly, two centuries ago by James Madison and Federalist Tim. James Madison talked about factions. That was an old word for special interests. And he said factions if they're able to seize control of government will strip away our liberty. And the genius of our Constitution is the checks and balances that divides government, that makes one branch fight with another branch, makes the executive and Congress fight, makes Congress and the judiciary fight, makes the federal government and the states fight, and what the framers their genius was. The Supreme Court is called it splitting the atom of sovereignty. And if the factions, if one faction can't seize control of everything, then they can't use that power against the people. That principle was true two centuries ago, it's true today. Why is our liberty so under assault? Because giant corporations, giant tech, giant government, they work together hand in hand. You look at what happened with Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan, Jens Saki. Oh come on, Jens Saki doesn't get the Justin Trudeau treatment. All right. You know, peppermint patty deserves some love. Jens Saki from the White House podium said, billionaires, oh billionaires in Silicon Valley, please silence that pesky Rogan guy. He's a pattern of government asking big tech to silence dissents in Canada, the Canadian truckers. Canadian government says, oh go fund me. Billionaires, please silence these pesky truckers by the way. The workers of the world had a revolt and the left is pissed. So what's the answer? The answer is threefold. Number one, fight power. Fight big government, fight big business, fight big tech, fight big Hollywood, fight big universities, fight the centralization of power, break it up, break big tech up into a million little pieces. Decentralize. You know, we just said Wain Loppierre talking about guns. Why is it the left when they seize control? They immediately want to take away everyone's guns because then the state has a monopoly on force. If the only people with guns are the jack booted thugs, then liberty is gone. So we need to decentralize, we need to break it apart. One of the reasons why I am so bullish on crypto, on Bitcoin, because it is decentralized and not controllable. And let me give a fantastic example. So Justin Trudeau said, I don't like me some truckers. So we're going to seize your assets. So then the court went to try to seize the crypto that was being given to the truckers. And I don't know how many of y'all saw a letter that I actually want to read from. The letter from a company, Bitcoin company called Nunchuck, here's part of the letter dear Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Our software is free. We do not collect any user identification information beyond email addresses. We also do not hold any keys. Therefore, we cannot freeze our user's accounts. We cannot prevent them from being moved. We do not have the knowledge of, quote, the existence nature value and location of our user's assets. This is by design. Please look up how self-custody and private keys work. When the Canadian dollar becomes worthless, we will be here to serve you too. That is spectacular. By the way, contrast that to the craving, sniveling response of corporate America. When some whiny snowflake tweets at them, they go, oh my god, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Like God bless you, say, into the government, go jump in a lake. That's how our country was founded. That is powerful, by the way, that is also why China recently banned Bitcoin. Because they can't control it, which is the exact same reason Elizabeth Warren hates Bitcoin. The Chinese Communist and Elizabeth Warren, they both want to control you. Your assets, your savings, your speech, your life, your children, every decision they want to control. And so we need to break up the means of controlling the citizenry. I want an unruly, uncontrollable American We the People. Number two, don't ever apologize to the woke mob. It doesn't work. They are not engaged in rational discourse. They are not actually offended at whatever idiocy it is they're whining about about that moment. They want to destroy you. They want to silence you. They want to subjugate you. Respond with joy. Laugh at them. It drives them bananas. Okay, our leftist, the least funny people on planet earth. You can't say that. You can't do that. No, no, no, I don't like that. I don't like that. What the hell up? It's not a year damn business. If I want to get a vaccine, I'll get the vaccine. If I don't want to get the vaccine, I won't get the vaccine. And it's not a year business how I decide for me and my family. That scares them because it's not controllable and the third thing I'm going to say is speak out. Use your voice. Every one of you has a powerful megaphone to the world. Speak out and use your voice. Two years ago I launched a podcast, verdict with Ted Cruz. All right, I want to say to everyone here, under 40. Please go and subscribe to my podcast. You can get it wherever you get your podcasts. Two years ago we were the number one ranked podcast in the world. To everyone over 40. Call your kids. Call your grandkids. And ask them to subscribe you to the podcast. Number two, text the word Cruz to the number two four 005. Let me give you that again. Cruz to two four 005. Why is that? Because we're using text. We're using the podcast. We're using email. We're using social media. We're using every tool to mobilize and energize a grassroots army because we are taking this country back from the lunatic socialist left that is trying to destroy our freedom. Let me say one final thing. In January of 2023, I'm looking forward to walking down the hallway in the United States cap. And to bumping into a little man wearing overalls, carrying a screwdriver and coming to change the sign on Nancy Pelosi's door. And Nancy is going to get on her broom. Okay, no, that's not fair. She's going to get on her private jets called the USS broom and fly back to California. And we're going to send Chuck Schumer back to New York City. And then we're going to tell Joe Biden it's 2025 and he'll just wander back to Delaware. Change is coming. It is powerful. You want to know how powerful? Find me one person on planet earth who doesn't know what Let's Go Branden means. And not just in red states, how many of you saw at the New England Patriots game in Boston, the entire crowd chanting Let's Go Branden. That is powerful. A wave is coming. We are taking our country back. We are standing up to power. We are defending liberty. We are defending the Constitution. We are defending the Bill of Rights. And together we will save this great nation. God bless you. Welcome Senator Josh Hawley. Hello, seat back. It's great to see you. It's great to be back here and with you, you know, the last time that we were here together just a year ago, they were trying to censor us, silence us, cancel us, muzzle us. In fact, they had just told me that because I stood up and objected on January 6th that I ought to be run out of the United States Senate, I've got news for you. I wasn't backing down then. I haven't changed my mind now. Election integrity matters. Standing up for the rule of law matters. And our stand on that day in sense is key for the liberty that we are fighting for. I don't know about you, but I thought the Biden administration was going to be pretty bad, didn't you? But they've turned out even worse than I could possibly have imagined. I mean, just look at what Joe Biden has tried to do in the space of one short year to this country. He has turned the FBI of the United States on the parents of the United States. Can you believe it? Treating school board parents at school boards as if they are domestic terrorists, sending FBI agents to go and knock on people's doors if they have the temerity to stand up and say, I don't want my kids to have to be masked in school. I don't want my kids to be taught critical race theory. He's tried to use the instruments of our own government to divide us, to separate us, to turn off speech that he doesn't want, that he doesn't like, that he doesn't approve of. And that's just getting started. Look at what he's done on the southern border. He's opened up the southern border and said to every cartel on the North American continent, come on in. The southern border, you know, sometimes we say it's chaos at the southern border, that's not quite right. Actually, somebody is in control of the southern border. The problem is, it's the cartels who are in control of the southern border, not the United States, the cartels who are running drugs across our border, who are running children across our border. Human trafficking is exploding. And I don't know about you. But in the state of Missouri where I'm from, we'd like to say that we're a border state too, because the drugs that are flooding into our schools, that are flooding into our neighborhoods, that are flooding into every part of the state are coming across that southern border that Joe Biden has thrown open and has said, come on in. It's chaos on the border. It's the cartel rule of the cartels on the border. It's the use of the FBI against parents and then look at what he did in Afghanistan. I have never seen an American president who would leave behind hundreds, if not thousands, of American citizens to the enemy and say that the operation was an extraordinary success. Do you remember that? Afghanistan wasn't an extraordinary success. It was an extraordinary failure by Joe Biden. It was an extraordinary collapse by this administration. It was the worst foreign policy disaster since the Vietnam War. 13 American service members, brave Marines, other members wearing the uniform were lost in Afghanistan guarding Abbey Gate because Joe Biden wouldn't order an evacuation when his own military told him to do it. It was days before the terrorist attacks Joe Biden hadn't even planned how he was going to get Americans out of the country. And yet he would go before the people of the United States and say that the evacuation was an extraordinary success and he was proud of it. That was the day ladies and gentlemen that I called on Joe Biden to resign. He should have resigned then. He should resign now. He's not fit to be president. He can't leave this country. He's trying to shove critical race theory down our throats and in every aspect of our government. It's in the military. It's in government training. It's in our universities. All backed now by the power of the Biden administration, I have sat in the United States Senate and asked nominee after nominee, will you pledge to oppose critical race theory? Will you pledge to stop it from being taught, from being promulgated in the United States government? And the answer is no. They're radical on this issue. They believe a critical race theory. They believe that America is systemically racist. They believe that America is systemically broken. They believe that we're a nation of oppressors. Well ladies and gentlemen, I've got news for you and for them. We're not a nation of oppressors. We're a nation of liberators. We're proud of our history. We're proud of our heritage and we're going to stand up for it. And now you look at what's happening in Ukraine. You talk about weakness on the part of Joe Biden. He comes to office and what does he do? He shuts down American energy production and green lights, Russian energy production. He green lights, Putin's pipeline and he shuts down American pipelines. Is it any wonder, is it any wonder that Vladimir Putin feels emboldened to do whatever the heck it is he wants to do? Is it any wonder that China feels emboldened to do whatever it is the heck that they want to do? When we have a president who doesn't believe in American strength, who doesn't believe in American energy, who doesn't believe in American jobs and who has no sense of the priorities and challenges that are threatening this country. I've got a suggestion for Joe Biden tonight. I would just say this, Mr. President, have some confidence in the American people. Show some strength to the world. Open up American energy production. Full throttle. Open it up right now. Put Americans back to work. You know, I noticed that red nicks and rough nicks get a lot of bad press these days. And hey, here's the true thing. Red nicks and rough nicks are the core, the backbone of the American economy. And it is time to allow the good, strong American worker to go out there and start drilling for oil to start exploring for natural gas to start fracking again. Let them do what we do best. Show America, show the world the strength of this nation. Put America back to work. Open up American energy. And I'll tell you this. I am not willing to wait around to see what Joe Biden does. On Monday, the United States Senate comes back into session. And on Monday, I will introduce legislation to open back up American energy production in this country. 100 percent. Open it up. Put people back to work. Get the oil flowing. Get the natural gas pumping. Get the biofuels going. All of it. We are the number one energy producing nation in the world or we should be. Joe Biden gave that away. It's time to take it back. And if you want to send a message to Vladimir Putin, here's a message to send him. We're going to be the ones who supply the oil and gas to the world. We're going to shut down your energy sector and we're going to open ours up like you've never seen it before. That's the message we ought to send. That's a message of American strength. This President, he doesn't believe in American strength. This President believes that there's something fundamentally wrong with the soul of this nation. And at the end of the day, he's really what we're fighting for, isn't it? We are fighting to defend the soul of America. You know? Joe Biden has spent a year. If you think about what all of his policies put together mean, he has spent a year telling this country that we are broken, that we are backwards, that we are racist, that we are weak. He thinks the soul of America, he thinks the heart of America is warped and wicked. Well, I'm from the heartland of America. I was born there. I was raised there. I know the heart of this country and it is true and it is good. And on the basis of America's heart, we will rebuild our strength. There's nothing wrong with America. There's something wrong with Joe Biden. That's what we have to take our stand on. This is the time to rebuild our strength on the principles and fundamentals that we hold most dear. To strengthen our families, to strengthen our neighborhoods, to strengthen our churches, to strengthen our nation. This is a time for American strength. The world needs America's strength. The world needs to see that we are ready to stand strong again. You know, Ronald Reagan used to say that in the 19th century, we built the greatest industrial economy that the world had ever seen. In the 20th century, we built the greatest technological economy the world had ever seen. And now in the 21st century, we seem to have spent most of it, thanks to our friends on the left, apologizing. And I don't know what in the world we're apologizing for. We have nothing to apologize for as Americans. We have everything to be proud of and to stand up for. So here's what I propose we do. I propose that in this critical year in 2022, when we have the opportunity to take back the United States House, to take back the United States Senate, that we stand up and say that the fight for America is about the soul of America. And we are going to take our stand on the goodness of America. And we are going to renew America's strength. We're going to open up our energy production. We're going to open up our economy. We're going to bring jobs back to this country. Why is it that we should be dependent for our energy, our critical goods on other nations and not just on any other nations, but on our enemies? Why is it that Joe Biden has tried to make us more dependent, has tried to make us subservient to China and Russia and Iran and OPEC? Why is it that Joe Biden now has to go to the OPEC countries and beg them, beg them to increase oil production? I say enough of that. America is the strongest nation in the history of the world and it's time we started acting like it. This is the time. So no matter what, this administration tries to do to divide us. And by the way, that's all they have left. Have you noticed that? All they have left is division and accusation. All they have left is the attempt to make us live in fear. That's what they've been trying to do since last January. They've been trying to tell us we've got to live in a state of constant emergency, COVID, a constant emergency. January 6th, the constant emergency. They've been saying that we've got to trust the government to tell us what we can do, where we can go, what we can teach our kids, what we can say, and the message is fear, fear, fear, fear. Well, I don't know about you, but I am an American. I refuse to live in fear. I refuse to be afraid. I refuse to bow down. I refuse to say the government can tell me what to do. And so here is my hope for 2022. This is going to be the year, my fellow Republicans, my fellow conservatives. This is going to be the year that we lead this nation out of fear, that we lead this nation back to strength, that we lead this nation to take a stand on the principles that we hold most dear, that we say there's nothing wrong with America, that America is the hope of the world. It's the future of the world, and it is still even now the last best hope on Earth. God bless you. Thank you so much for having me. God bless, see you back. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you",

        "transcript": " A wave of disappointment. One of President Donald Trump's most loyal voting blocks, Cuban and Venezuelan immigrants. Now, speaking out in Miami, the Republican stronghold, as the recent wave of deportations hits home, and the Trump administration moved to end temporary legal status or TPS for more than 500,000 people who arrived during the Biden administration. Alina Gondez says she came here from Cuba on humanitarian parole in 2023. Her husband, Arielara, crossed the border with Mexico twice, once in 2019 when he was detained and deported, and then again in 2022. Six weeks ago, he was taken into custody at his residency hearing. Kaya, he was given an appointment to go to ICE. You told him before he left for that appointment, you don't have anything to worry about. Instead, he was transferred to Texas, where we spoke to him from his detention center. What have you done? Arielara, what do you think is happening in this country? In this moment, the situation is, how do you feel about everything that's happening right now in this country with the deportations? I said all the things I don't know. You don't understand how this could happen. What did you think was going to happen when Trump won? You're saying you believed the president when he said he was going to deport criminals? Now, Alina is left behind with her daughter, seven-month-old son, and Ariel's 70-year-old grandmother, who has been a U.S. citizen for years. They're single-bore with me. Together, facing a reality, they never imagined. Your whole family voted for Trump. Lo apoyaba. Atron, during his campaign, did you support him? No, I'm just outside of it. You can't vote. But you feel disappointed, deceived, enganyada. It's a concern democratic strategist are capitalizing on, with billboards like these calling Republican lawmakers traders. Still, here in Florida, Trump won almost 70 percent of the Cuban-American vote in 2024, along with 61 percent of deraille, home to the largest Venezuelan-American population in the U.S. They used us. Adelis Ferro is the co-founder and executive director of the Venezuelan-American caucus. How is the Venezuelan community feeling right now, especially in the context of these deportations? Desperate, terrified. There are people with mental health issues. There are people with panic attacks and sciatia attacks. They rather to die than go back to Venezuela and then have to stop taking their lives. I have those messages because the situation here is so bad. They're so bad at taking their own lives. Yes, then go back to Venezuela. The ripple effects affecting families and businesses. This, Venezuelan business owner who asked us not to use his name to protect his business and fellow owners, said the political instability has led to a 20 percent drop in revenue. It's affected your clients as well as the people who work here. I understand that there are a lot of people who have invested in business here. A lot of people have already invested in businesses here and they've stopped because they just don't know what the future brings. Still experts say the current turmoil may not hurt the Republican party. All this stuff done in the first 200 days of the administration. They have a long road ahead before the midterms. Do you think that Trump will pay a political price? I'm not sure that Trump or the Republican party as an institution is going to suffer a great deal unless the Democrats can muster an opposition that is a compelling vision as to how things would be done differently.

        "transcript": " Well, we promised you all that we would start at 8.30, so we're going to be prompt. I'm Darryl Issa, and I'm here as the sign might indicate, a little sneak preview. I'm here to announce that in the weeks leading up to this, our exploratory committee has received more than 2,400 not just letters asking us to run but checks, averaging over $82 a piece. And in politics, when thousands of people respond to, I'm looking at this, I'm exploring it, you pay attention. And so today I'm announcing that I will be the next congressman from the 50th Congressional District. I'm dedicated to do that because I believe that I have the history, the skills, the seniority and the capability to hit the ground running, not just for this district, but for California to help Republicans compete in what has become a very treacherous and difficult Congress and to retake the majority. I'm surrounded today by some of the people that I've had the honor of speaking to over the last few weeks or in the case of Supervisor Jacob for many, many years. And I've asked each of them if they'll give you their thoughts today on why they're here to support me. And with that, I'd like to introduce the county supervisor standing in her district and my friend, Diane Jacob. All right. Thank you, Darryl, and I can't tell you how excited I am to be here today to support Darryl, Isa for Congress. There is, as we know, a significant amount of turbulence that's going on in Washington, DC. And unfortunately, I think it's going to get worse rather than getting better. And we cannot afford to get this election wrong. Darryl is battle tested. He has proven leadership that we desperately need in Washington, DC. And he has seniority. That is very important. The seniority will help us get what we need in East County. And he will hit the ground running. That's one thing that makes him different from any other candidate. The election, far as I'm concerned, can't come soon enough. And I have total confidence that Darryl will represent this district well. Think about this. East County problems are America's problems. Illegal immigration, the illegal traffic, human traffic, drugs coming across our border, homelessness, mental health issues, housing issues. He will be there to fight for us. On a personal note, whenever East County has needed help over the years, and I've been in this position for a few, whenever I've called Darryl for help, he's always been there to help. And he not only has listened, but he has followed through and he's done the best that he could do to help us out here in East County. And he doesn't just listen. He is actually advocated on our behalf. And I truly believe that he will have our back when he wins this election. And that can't come soon enough. So Darryl, I'm very proud to support you in this and I would ask all to join me in this effort. It's extremely important. Thank you. Thank you, Diane. And now it's an honor. The man who has already been out there talking about this district and the need for representation of the mayor of El Cajón and a man that I respect very much as a solid conservative Bill Wells. Welcome to the City of El Cajón. I'm really glad you're here today. This is an important day. It's really an important day for me. I've spent the last year and a half of my life running for Congress. And the reason I got involved in the Congressional race in the first place was because I thought it was very important that the 50th Congressional District continue to be led by a conservative Republican. I think that at the time that I got involved, it seemed like I was doing something that was good for the district and I wasn't sure anybody else was going to step up and do it. This year it's a little bit different. And with Darryl Issa getting involved in the race, I feel confident that the right man is here to lead us into the future. And I feel safe and confident in taking back my promise to run for the 50th District. I'm going to drop out of the race to support Darryl Issa fully. Darryl Issa is a matter of respect. Darryl Issa is an iconic conservative. Darryl Issa believes in the things that I think most people in the 50th District believe it. They believe in personal freedom. They believe in a limited government. They believe in personal responsibility. They believe in lower taxes. They believe in keeping the borders safe. And on top of all those things, I also have had conversations with Darryl about things that are close to my heart. As the mayor of the city of Elcahontas as a psychologist, I worry about things like homelessness. I worry about things like our refugee community. And Congressman Issa has been very interested in what I've had to say. And he has made promises to me that he will do everything he can as a Congressman to work with myself and the other mayors of the district to combat homelessness and to combat the scourge of mental illness that has now become a national problem. It's because of these things and many, many more things that I confidently say, I am going to vote for Darryl Issa. And I hope that everybody else in the 50th District will vote for Darryl Issa. And I look forward to a much brighter future in Washington. Thank you very much. Now, you never argue with people that are supporting you in such a wonderful way. But our next person, Mayor Sam Abed, is probably going to mention that this district also includes North County, San Diego, and South County Riverside. So I'll just say that in fact, it's been an honor over the years to work with Sam and to work with people in North County and in Riverside because a third of this district, a third of the area of this district was mine for most of my time in Congress. And during that time, I grew to know Sam Abed very, very well as a leader. And Bill, when you said iconic, I now give you Mayor Sam Abed. I got it. Thank you, Darryl. And good morning. And thank you, Bell, for hosting this great event in the great city of Elcajón. This is a city that is driving under the leadership of my good friend, Bill Wells. The 50th district is a large district representing 750,000 residents and also it includes North County as Congressman Issa said. It's a strong conservative district and also it has a history of electing conservative Congress in the past. We have an unprecedented coalition of candidates here dropping out of the race to support the best candidate that can win the 50th district against Campa Najar. In 2016, it was close. We were close by 3.6 points to lose that district. Our common goal is very simple. It's to keep the 50th district in the Republican hands. I've known Darryl for 15 years. He's a man of integrity. He loves America. He is passionate about serving our 50th district. He has the perfect conservative credential. He served honorably for 18 years fighting government corruption and also championing transparent government. He has a great list of accomplishments. And as Diane said, he's a tested leader. People will focus on the 50th district. The 50th district will be his priority, the only priority. The 50th district will be his agenda, the only agenda. And he will get a critical committee assignment because of his seniority and that will best serve the 50th district. Congressman Issa represent our values, the 50th district values. Today I'm suspending my campaign for 2020 and I will proudly endorse and campaign from Congressman Issa. Iscundiro was the ground zero in 2016 and Iscundiro will be the ground zero for victory in 2020. Thank you. Just to let you know not everybody running in this race was an elected official. And my next friend is somebody that, be honest Larry and I didn't know we as other that well. But we have a lot in common and what we have in common is a love for our country years of service. And so when we first met I wasn't planning, I wasn't really thinking that Larry would come on board as a supporter and drop out of his own race. But as we talked about our goals, we talked about the need for national defense and in fact to remember those when they come home, this Navy seal began to be in my opinion. The ideal campaign manager, which my campaign manager in the back is going to worry about. But since I've met him and begun working with him as we explored, I've felt that Larry is the kind of a person that I will be very proud to take everywhere with me because for all of us in San Diego, Riverside and Orange County, we also know we're defined by the men and women who serve in the Navy, the Marines, a few Army folks, a few Air Force folks, and a little bit of Coast Guard. But I give you Larry Willsky Navy seal. Thanks. Well, I appreciate that those kind words. One of the things that's very important in this district is we have the highest concentration of veterans, retirees, Department of Defense employees, and active duty military in the state of California. We have to have a veteran support in this. It's plain and simple. And Mr. Isis' service is fantastic. Ten years active duty, ten years in the reserves as well. Another ten in the reserves. So he knows the needs of veterans, and as everybody knows what happens to veterans on a negative side bleeds over into society. We need to stop problems right there. My campaign has been wonderful. It's been something that's a great experience. And right now, Sam, I'm going to disagree with you. We're not dropping out of this race. What we're doing is we're joining one team, one fight. So Sam's not dropping out. Bill's not dropping out. I'm not. What we're doing is we're unifying around leadership that has brought us together and that's the kind of leadership that will bring our country together. We need this to happen. We need to happen as one team, one fight. Thank you very much, sir. Do you want to? Okay. I think we're, we have one more speaker, but the size of this district means that Matt who's coming from Temecula hit what we all hit. And I'm going to open this up for questions, but I'm going to make one short statement. For the 18 years that I served, one of the things that I worked on that was still unfinished business is the federal government ensuring that our interstate system, including the interstate 15 and its connecting roads, the interstate five and its connecting roads operate properly. And it's an area of contention. So it's no surprise that to get from the north part of this district in Temecula down to here takes longer than it should. And that'll continue to be an effort. So with that, I would open up for questions and where's my KUSI reporter? You were the first here. Do you have a question? The president still wants to challenge your microbiome as your backbone? Well, that's for the press and others to decide. We're not here to talk about any of the other candidates, not even at this point, Camp in Nishara, the Democrat. We're here to talk about one team, one goal for this district. And I think that's what I'm going to be campaigning on is I have a record. I'm not going to be somebody that walks in and says I'm going to change Washington. No, I've been changing Washington for 18 years. And when I return, I will continue to do exactly the kinds of things I did that made me friends and enemies, made me people who would certainly oppose me, but also made me somebody that could get things done for San Diego County. And I will say one thing, and I think you're going to see this in the days to come. We were a good delegation with Republicans and Democrats able to get things done for San Diego and to bring it home. And the Chamber and others recognize that. I want to make sure that although we will fight hard in Washington for conservative values, I intend to continue to work with across the aisle to get things done when we can agree. And thank you. Do you use the word, adventurous, to describe the current poverty? Is that like more than? No, I think that this attempt to find a reason to impeach the president is unheard of and uncalled for. Historically, during my tenure, and well before, you had actual events that then led to people saying, well, should we look into it and then impeachment became a question. Instead, we had the current chairman of Judiciary, a committee I served on, and it would be the senior member if I went back there. Judiciary, in fact, on a train before he was sworn in, he was already talking about impeaching the president. This kind of activity is wrong, and I will stand up to it when I return as I did when I was there. I told presidents accountable for what they do wrong and administrations and I have a proven track record on that with both parties. But I also know that you let a president lead and do his job, and you support that before you turn around and automatically try to undermine it, something that I've seen going on, which really bothers me. You know, Duncan Hunter Senior was a mentor of mine and is a friend. And Duncan Hunter Junior, I hope I've been a mentor to him at times. He's been a friend and a colleague. His current situation is regrettable, and I know that we're here today because of questions about whether or not he could win this if he were the nominee. We're not here for anything different than that, and I have said for a long time and I'll say it again here, he deserves his day in court. But the 50th congressional district does deserve to have the ability to retain this as a conservative district and quite frankly to have a member who can show up and take all of his committee assignments. Yes, sir. You know, I long ago figured out that telling, and I hopefully I didn't tell anyone here to drop out, you know, telling people to drop out rather than letting them decide what's in the best interest of themselves and their families, I think is the right thing to do. We've all benefited by Duncan Hunter Senior and Duncan Hunter Junior fighting hard for a men and women in uniform, serving on the Armed Services Committee, working hard to do things for San Diego. There is a regrettable situation, and I've got to be honest, I served during the time in which Duke Cunningham was our congressman, and I was side by side with him. These are very unfortunate situations, unfortunate, but just as I would have said with Duke and I'll say it with Duncan, he deserves his day in court. I expect everyone to presume he's innocent until proven guilty, but we do, we are here because we believe that we need a single candidate who can in fact assure that this conservative district stays in conservative hands. I have. I was with Duncan Senior not too long ago for an extended period of time, and I think there are even pictures of us standing together. I will tell you that I spoke to both Duncan Hunter Senior and Duncan Hunter Junior yesterday. Those conversations are private, I wish them both well. They are both people that I have a long history with and that I've worked with, and we've done legislation together and we've been supportive. This campaign will not be about the other guy. This will be a referendum on am I the right person to come back and serve for a number of terms again in the United States Congress? Yes, please. You know, I've only browsed when it came up as content online and I read through it and I have to tell you that it's the chief law enforcement officer of the United States is the president of the United States. I do find it interesting as a Republican that immediately this was somehow supposed to be bad even before we saw the content. Now that I've seen the content, quite frankly, a discussion about an individual and asking for an investigation, doesn't that sound pretty familiar? Didn't we have a secret investigation and wiretap of the president when he was a candidate and wasn't that in some cases arranged with the government? So I think the fact that he simply said, make sure we have the facts, doesn't to me personally doesn't bother me, but I will read the thing more thoroughly, but I did browse it over knowing that might be a question this morning. Yes, sir. But what is the difference between the case of foreign government to help them with this Well, I don't think for a moment asking a question about whether somebody broke the law is in fact engaging in anything related to the campaign. I think people have to remember one thing and I'll say it here today and I'll stand by it. You have two jobs when you're a elected official. One of them is about politics and elections and you can't divorce yourself, but you also have your basic duty, the basic duty of whether or not there is foreign corruption. And I'll comment specifically on this one, we give a lot of money and I've been very active in giving money for an aid to countries all over the world. And one of the things we ask them to do is to stop corruption and one of the things they often fail to do, Ukraine being no exception is to stop corruption. So whether it's $400 million to Ukraine or it's half a billion dollars to Nigeria, stopping the corruption there of all sorts is critical. Other questions? I know you don't have to live in a different way, but I do. You know, I have a voter in the district. I have a house in the district that I have owned for 15 years and I want you to know that I have my mother's full support from that house in Bonzl. And I'm glad you asked that question because my mom will not be coming on camera. She has chosen not to for years. But one of the things that people forget is that a third of this district I represented for all those years. My mother and her late husband were able to vote for me until redistricting. My good friend and I, she wrote, I walked in Julian's parades for all those years. And so whether it was going up to Julian, going to Valley Center or going all the way to be honest, well beyond this address, I used to have to go to Lake Elsinore in Paris during my 10 year. Members of Congress are elected to uphold and defend the Constitution. They go back as a state delegation. And when we do so, we represent much more than geographic lines. And so yes, I have represented a third of the geographic lines of this current district, but I've also represented, and I think Supervisor Jacobs said this very well, I've represented San Diego, Orange and Riverside County and the state of California for 18 years. And if you don't think of it that way, you get into trouble. And I'll give you even one more. Back to the belabor of the point, I'm not a senator just a house candidate. When you go there often, you're representing the best interest of people who have had a hurricane damage in Florida or floods along the Mississippi. When you send somebody to Congress, you send them to think about bigger than your backyard. I've got mayors behind me and a county supervisor and they do a great job of that and will bring support from Washington where appropriate. And quite frankly, I have had the honor of being in those parades along this route and I've been down to visit with Sequoan and I've been these areas because that's what you do. And every time there was a fire, whether it was in East County, North County or up all the way in San Bernardino, the fact is we as congressmen show up. And so hopefully that's what people will be looking for is somebody that's going to be bigger than just a line which does include my mom. Other questions? Yes, sir. Well, you know, in this district, a Democrats expected to get about 40 percent. So we've got close to 50 percent last time. And so it's going to be important after we go through a robust primary for one Republican to go forward who can clearly strike a difference and engage voters. And you know, a question that hasn't been asked, but it's been out there is, well, you represented a district. How did you do there? Well, you know, the thing about my other district, which we now have a good candidate running for is in the 2016 election, I got 9 percent more vote than President Trump, meaning that 9 to 10 out of every people who voted for Hillary Clinton saw it fit on top of that to vote for me. And one of the reasons is that I don't just represent Republicans and conservatives. I represent Americans. I am a conservative. And my voting record indicates that. But it also you'll find that whether it's Juan Vargas and I going to the Sinai to look at the peril for Israel or going to the border and standing at the Tijuana River demanding that we do more and that the Mexican government do more to clean it up. So it doesn't pollute our beaches. The fact is I'll work across the aisles. And I think that's why when people get through that first round, they're going to vote for me again over a progressive Democrat who I quite frankly don't think understands that you have to represent everybody as I have. Yes, ma'am. Well, I'm glad you separated those two because there's no question at all that the emphasis on improving our treatment for people that are either mentally ill or quite frankly, many of our troops that come back with PTSD which has similar effects is an important area. And that's medical. And one of the things I championed while I was in Congress was getting, for example, for our veterans direct access so they wouldn't have to wait in line sometimes dying before they got treatment at the veterans facilities. We need to do that for everyone who's in mental distress or homeless because of a need for care. I'm going to tell you that there's no one answer that is a solution to homelessness. Up in North County and Esconditos and Marcos and so on, we have solutions for change. We also have the Alpha project. We have a number of groups, but we also have what you see in San Diego, which is an overwhelming number of people on the street. And we're going to need to work federally with funding, but also locally with the kind of caring compassion that doesn't let people stay on the street in disease situations. And so, you know, I look at San Diego Mayor Faulkner and realize that he's been fighting that. He's been fighting it fairly well to try to get people off the street. So the answer is that working with, you know, HUD and other agencies of federal government, Congress needs to work also with programs that work. And I think the short answer to your question is, I will continue to ensure that federal funding goes to programs that work, to cities that are willing to do their part of it, like San Diego and quite frankly, like El Cajón and other cities that are trying not to become 10 cities and cities in which people's individual rights, their home rights are being intruded on. I think are critical. That's a great question. And I'll repeat it for everyone. I was honored to be nominated by the president for a confirmable position. The Senate delayed me like it has delayed hundreds and hundreds of other people. I believe that had I been in that position and other positions that the president wanted me to do, I might not have been able to focus on this race. But I would like to believe that everything happens in life for a reason. And those reasons are not controlled by man, but by a higher power. And so I'm here today, oddly enough, because Democrats in the Senate have slowed everything down to a crawl. And it became obvious that I could do more for my country. So to answer the second half of your question, after the president was here last week, I flew back with him on the plane. We talked for a short time on the plane. He asked me to come back to the White House. I spent an hour in the Oval with he, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, and Chief Mulvaney. And we talked about what I could do and about this race. And I left there with a clear understanding when I've sent a follow-up letter to the president that I would not continue. And that I thank the president, but I felt that Secretary Pompeo absolutely deserved to have people put forward through that committee ahead of the TDA position. And that was part of the consideration, is I'm sitting there with the Secretary of State. And he absolutely positively has a backup of not a few, but like 100 positions that need filled. So that all went into it. And the discussion with the president, I left with his knowing that I would not be pursuing the TDA. And I came home to prepare for this. Well, first of all, Brian Merriott, I've already endorsed him. He's a good candidate. But I'll be candid. When the district changed, I didn't fit the district. It was a, it became a very, very, if you will, moderate district. And although I was able to hold it, hold it by almost 10 out of every 100 people that voted for Hillary Clinton, then voted for me, I really wasn't the person that fits it. I've been somebody that's worked with the Freedom Caucus, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows are people that were worked for me in my committee that I helped and that helped me. And my politics are conservative politics. So sometimes you have to ask, do you fit the district? And the new 49th district with Salana Beach in the University of California, San Diego, really didn't fit my politics. We tried to find somebody who would do better in it. We thought we had it. We now have another candidate. And to be honest, Brian Merriott's working very, very well. And I expect him to do well in that district. Okay. Again, I want to thank all of you for being here. It's going to be an exciting race. Stay tuned. And I want you to see my kitchen cabinet one last time because these are the people that help me make the decision to run. Thank you. Thank you. Great job. Great job. I don't do it without you. I mean that. Honestly.",

So without further ado, Congressman Issa is a successful businessman, entrepreneur, former Army captain, and now leader of the conservative resurgence that is really sparking up in Southern California. I have firsthand knowledge. Great things are happening. People are angry. They've gone from fear fearful to concerned to angry and things are happening. I assure you good stuff is coming out of California and we will bring that state back, especially the leadership of Congressman Darryl Issa. Please welcome him. This feels like Reagan country. Tim, thank you very much. It's not often I get an introduction that doesn't read from my old bio and it's really enjoyable not to talk about what I did in the past, but to talk about what we're doing here today. This is an exciting time for conservatives. Scarcely a year ago, there was questions. Questions about whether or not we were our ideas were out of favor. Whether or not change was a change very different than the one that's being talked about here today. Today, however, we are watching a movement that promises us that in fact the American people are with us. They want the ideas that made this country great and strong. The experiment in liberty, the George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison conceived of over 230 years ago, has stood the test of time and today is invoked like never before. Please, feel free. Now as Tim said, I have the honor of overseeing the Watchdog Committee of Congress. Now some would say that the chairman of that committee oversees it, but the chairman of that committee is the party of the speaker, the party of the president, and the party that in fact is not going to oversee itself, it's going to basically apologize for this president to spend for this president. So I'm the luckiest man in Washington. I'm lucky in a strange, strange way. I'm lucky that the president shall candidate I didn't vote for. In fact, got elected. Now that kind of luck I can do without. And as Dick Cheney said to this group the other day, this is a one-term president we trust. But our standard that has sustained us for 230 years is the standard checks and balances. And so I'm honored that at a time in which the party of the majority and the party of the president has ideas very different than those here, very different than the ideas that allowed us to survive and come out of the depression, which was free market and private enterprise, the policies that allowed us to defeat the Soviet communism and to end it once and for all, which of course was strong national defense. The party and the principles that allowed us to be a shining light of liberty around the world, not in fact a collective for the greater good, willing to co-op our ideas in order to fit in in a ever more socialistic world. As a young kid growing up in a working class neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio, there we go. A little bit for Cleveland, please. I always take something from Dan Lungren, which is that he said when he was running for governor in California the new weather pioneers kept moving west. And by the way, it wasn't the great parks, the great museums, the great educational capabilities that drove them from Cleveland. It was just the weather. And those of you who have gone for a walk today on the snow-filled sidewalks here know there's a reason that this place is not always a warm swamp. And in the year of global warming we've had four of 14 of the worst snowstorms since 1870. Perhaps when the hot air leaves this town that's what happens. But the opportunities that I had, even though I left in my senior year of high school to go to the Army and didn't get a high school diploma and got a GED, the Army scholarship and the opportunity to graduate from college, be commissioned, learn skills that have worked for me throughout my business career and today are still being used here in Congress. All of that comes because in this country all one needs is a belief in our principles and a willingness to work and the opportunities have always been there and will always be there. Before you leave I would ask you all to provide a few dollars to the Metro or the cabs here and go down to the 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and then go up to the nation's capital. Our founding fathers knew that in fact what would oversee our government was the house of the people, the Congress, a place where every two years we go back and we face you, the voters. We go back and ask you how we're doing and we're so often told quite rightfully we should do better and do better we will. This administration needs the scrutiny of my committee. I've been privileged to lead a group of individuals not to be the leader but to lead this group of individuals who have done great research, who have leveraged our capabilities with capabilities around the country with people who have done the things they should do. Blue the whistle as former A.Corn people on wrongdoing of A.Corn. Doug in the dumpsters in San Diego to find 50,000 pages of documents intended to be destroyed but unfortunately left in an unlocked dumpster. We here today are here to a great extent for this panel to talk about the wrongdoing of A.Corn but before that I want to talk very specifically about this president. This president would have you believe that in fact he inherited a great deal and that he does he is here today and doing the people's work to change America for the better and that he works for you. He would have you believe that but I would say one year after the stimulus of $787 billion without a single Republican vote that his policies are not only failed but you can begin to see a pattern in his policies. The pattern in his policies are very clear. Therefore the unions, they are for the Democratic machine, they are for the Liberal agenda and I am going to give you a case in point. My investigators have done what investigators do. They have searched through to see what is that the president is really committed to? Where were his real campaign promises? So I would ask you to take a moment and look at this video and then see if the video doesn't answer exactly what is going on here in Washington. You know what you have got a friend of me and I definitely welcome A.Corn's input. You don't have to ask me about that. I am going to call you even if you didn't ask me. When I ran project mode, voter registration drive in Illinois, you know A.Corn was smack dab in the middle of it. Once I was elected, there wasn't a campaign that A.Corn worked on down in Springfield that I wasn't right there with it since I've been in the United States Senate. I've been always a partner with A.Corn as well. I've been fighting with A.Corn alongside A.Corn on issues you care about. My entire crew. I like my A.C. on my side. Every major bill, this Congress's sense of the president, has been loaded with kickbacks, payoffs and airmarks, designed to reward liberal special interest groups, youth labor unions and political allies of the Democratic Party. That is undeniable. What was also undeniable is yes, A.Corn is at the center of the wall. The most important thing that you're going to hear on this panel today is not about a question of the left or the right. It's going to be about an organization, A.Corn, who is an ally of the service employee international union and a number of other unions we've now uncovered that are directly working with them. They have formed a criminal enterprise. In my report last year, I asked the question, is A.Corn intentionally structured as a criminal enterprise?",

Once I was elected there wasn't a campaign that Acorn worked on down in Springfield that I wasn't right there with you. Since I've been in the United States Senate I've been always a partner with Acorn as well. I've been fighting with Acorn alongside Acorn on the issues you care about. My entire crew. Every major bill this Congress has sent to the president has been loaded with kickbacks, payoffs and earmarks designed to reward liberal special interest groups, labor unions and political allies of the Democratic Party. That is undeniable. But what is also undeniable is yes, Acorn is at the center of all. The most important thing that you're going to hear on this panel today is not about a question of the left or the right. It's going to be about an organization, Acorn, who as an ally of the service employee international union and a number of other unions we've now uncovered that are directly working with them, they have formed a criminal enterprise. In my report last year I asked the question is Acorn intentionally structured as a criminal enterprise. When you find over 100 corporations and the lead corporation which could be a nonprofit, not being a nonprofit and paying taxes specifically because they didn't want to be under that umbrella, putting together an impossible to separate group of organizations that are co-located with unions, have dual hats with unions, you understand that one of the things that we discovered is the service employee international union and Acorn are not only co-located but they instruct people to say they represent both organizations. Like that wouldn't be a small conflict for a nonprofit community organization that only cares about the poor. Carrying about the poor and union efforts, do they really go hand in hand? I believe on this panel today you're going to see that it's just the opposite. Acorn not only leveraged over $53 million of taxpayers' money but tens of million dollars of money extorted from banks based on you don't want us talking bad about you so fund our outreach, fund our ability to help the underserved get alone. That money was unabashedly used in combination with the union and other democratic associations to, in fact, distort the very democracy we depend on. For all of us here today the most important thing we care about is that our process be able to make a fair decision. In Massachusetts just a matter of weeks ago we saw a decision that was unthinkable in the polls in possible a year ago and determined by the people of Massachusetts in spite of every effort to turn out unlimited democratic votes to exaggerate the support of a flawed candidate, Scott Brown got elected. The lights were on very bright and it was much harder to distort that election. It is not hard to do a few thousand votes in a congressional race. The amount of thousands of votes that you have to put together, the difference between a Republican majority and a Democrat majority or vice versa, quite frankly, is usually less than a few hundred thousand votes and you do a district by district. I am telling you today that this organization, in fact, sets out to do exactly that, to shade it enough to make a difference and they do it at all levels. In case some of you are conservative Democrats as you might be, let me make something very clear. They don't just defeat Republicans with Democrats. They play in the primary when you have a conservative Democrat that fits his or her district. They play to make sure they get their particular style of Democrat. They distort democracy in the primary. They distort democracy in the general. Now before this panel comes up and I am going to do everything I can to get you the opportunity to hear this, I want to just set the record straight on this president because I think it's important that somebody say that all we need to do is shine the truth and then let people decide for themselves. The American people need the facts on this administration and here they are. First, the president has the nerve to say he will limit his own campaign spending. Well he relies on Acorn to illegally do his election work for him and then lectures the Supreme Court justices on protecting the rights of those participating in elections. And to my amazement, his economic team covers up what's really happening in our economy and in calling the shots they actually are trying to say that their bailouts and borrowing are part of our recovery. True. Third and most dangerously, a national security team whose efforts to dismantle effective system of protecting American has won a clause and even a Nobel Peace Prize. And who gave us the award, those who have no vested interest in our security, not the American people who know that in fact a prisoner of war is not tried in a Illinois or New York court. So why is an unlawful, go ahead please. An unlawful combatant is a prisoner of war who has violated the laws of war. That person is less entitled to protection than a prisoner of war and yet this administration is insisting on giving special rights beyond what a prisoner of war would have and it's wrong. Fourth, the campaign spins team has hyped the stimulus jobs that do not exist, has called record budget deficits, fiscal restraint, has pushed corrupted science to get a global warming tax and has last and most unconstantably reached out to us saying that he wants by partisanship in order to get a partisan advantage for a health care bill the American people have already decided they do not want. I first voted in a federal election for Richard Nixon. For those who remember Richard Nixon that means I'm old. But if I were old enough to remember this I would never forget it and I want us all to take this to heart. President Lincoln once warned our greatest danger if it is ever to reach us must spring up from among us. It cannot come from abroad if destruction be our lot Lincoln said it must be our it must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men we must live throughout all time or die by suicide. That is an amazing statement at a time when this administration's policy are both political and economic suicide. I charge you to be the truth bearers to change that in this election and the one that follows. Thank you and God bless you.",

        "transcript": " It is so great to be here in the motor city. As someone who graduated from college just a few miles from here, and the son of an auto worker, it is so great to see all these people wanting to get America working again. When I arrived here and realized just a few weeks ago, how many of our Chrysler and other workers are laid off because of this economy? How many people cannot afford what they want or need because of the inflation? And how this administration continues to talk about the great economy and no problem in the border is sealed, I realized that there is no better place to have a turning point in this race than right here in Michigan. And as a proud Arab American, someone who grew up knowing that the largest communities outside the Middle East are here in the Midwest, I also know that in fact the peace in the Middle East that was achieved four years ago is in ruins today and can only be restored by a return to the kind of engagement we saw during the four Trump years. So I'm here today to tell everyone here that it's working. The American people and particularly the people of Michigan see through the lies and the claims that the border is sealed, the economy is fine and the inflation is down, there's never been a better time for everyone. They see that's not the truth. All they have to do is cast a gas station to know that it's time for four more years of President Trump and his leadership. Now effectively on the first day of mass voting here in Michigan, there is a message. Tell your friends to vote now, to vote for President Trump, and tell people why you're voting for President Trump. Because the last part of a winning campaign here in Michigan that returns President Trump to the White House and the leadership that we've known is in fact in your hands. The person you reach out to and you tell them that today is the day to vote for change. It is in your hands. 10,000 or 11,000 votes is all that it might take. Everyone in this room and those who couldn't get into this room outside knows you make a difference, do it for your country, your children and our planet. God bless.",

        "transcript": " Congressman Darrell Issa, representative for California's 50th Congressional District. Member of the House Judiciary Committee. Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Former Chairman House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Author of the book, Watchdog, the real stories behind the headlines from the congressmen who exposed Washington's biggest scandals. With nearly 20 years in the House of Representatives, Congressman Issa is recognized as a tough investigator, and, as is the title of his book, a Watchdog, especially on matters of waste, fraud and abuse. Congressman Issa is the principal author of the Bipartisan Digital Accountability and Transparency Act. This law institutes government-wide standards for spending data given the public unprecedented access to federal spending information. The immediate management of technology in government or national technology policy affecting privacy, intellectual property or social media, Congressman Issa has few peers. He is the co-author with Congressman Jerry Connolly of the Landmark Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, which increases both the authority and accountability of federal chief information officers. When Issa is the 2019 recipient of the CES Government Technology Leadership Award, Edge 2021 is pleased to welcome to the stage Congressman Darrell Issa. Well, that was polite, but last night it was a larger crowd. You were more excited. Is it to the lack of alcohol? Don, can we get something to spruce up this crowd? They've given me 20 minutes, which is either 19 minutes too long for a Congressman, 19 and a half minutes too long, or way too short to talk about the challenges that all of you are going to face in the immediate years to come. So I'm going to choose to take all those challenges and boil them down to now 19 minutes, rather than that introduction, which implies that Congress has all that much of a role in this. When Jerry Connolly and I worked on Fatara and also on the Data Act with Senator Warner and others, what we were really trying to do was simply to unleash the capability of the men and women in the government to, in fact, modernize the government. That job is always going to be a work in progress, but unfortunately some of our competitors, and for a moment I'll just use China as an example, they are so far ahead of us in the focus on unleashing that in fact, Congress has to help the federal workforce and our private sector partners catch up, because that's where we are. We are no longer, this is like when Sputnik went up, oddly enough, the Russians called their vaccine Sputnik, which I thought was interesting because they were not first with the vaccine and it doesn't work as well, but for Russia, Sputnik is still their pride. But like Sputnik, we are behind our competition. We're behind them in cyber security, at least offensively. We're certainly behind them in the ability to knock your own satellite out of space. When we think about everything that we live by, kinetically, we have challenges and those are not the subject of today. How we work with a Navy now, the Chinese Navy is larger than the US Navy, that's for another day and another committee. And when we look at the data that is being produced in the private sector and the massive amount of data that's being produced at the government behest, either directly or indirectly, there is today no central ability of our government to say what is our data plan. Nearly ten years ago, the then Republican leader Eric Canner and I were in a meeting and he asked me to be there because he said you're kind of a techie guy and you know about this big data thing. And I thought it was interesting that he knew enough to know that he knew this was important but he wasn't sure what it was going to be. Now he now works in New York, he's up in the Wall Street area, they get it on what their big data is about. But let's just go through a simple reality and I know there are people here who are doing biometric research, artificial intelligence for recognizing faces in a crowd quickly, all kinds of interesting technology. But let's just go through a simple one that I think is important. When Tiger Woods had his accident, a few days after his accident, they got a warrant and they took the computer out of that car so they knew what the G forces were, the speed and all the other characteristics immediately before his accident. As many of you know, with 5G, that data will be in all likelihood being transmitted in real time. What are we going to do with it and how are we going to do it? I've rambled through a few areas of data but I want to propose something for all of you to consider and I told Beth I was going to point her out but I can't see in the crowd. There we go, you're in the back row. In your role at the Department of Homeland Security, this may be more significant to you than anything else. In one year, America decided that it was going to go from discovering a new disease to having a vaccine and effectively the cure for the COVID-19. We called it a Manhattan Project. Great. Manhattan Project was great in World War II. It really had a lot to do with ending the war, certainly it ended the war with Japan. So where is the similarity in data with COVID-19 and with the Manhattan Project? Let me explain for a moment something that's going on in government that I'm concerned about. We have the private sector working in partnership with the federal government and we have now more or less nine different vaccines and the intellectual property that went with all of it. The highest level of government, there is now a call to invalidate all the patents, all the protective intellectual property that was developed at the cost of billions of dollars over that period of time based on the assumption that then we would give this technology to everyone in the world and it would drive down the price. As though patents are the only reason that it cost one to three dollars to make a vaccine per dose. Now I'm going to relate that to the Manhattan Project for a moment and I'll bring this all back together before my 20 minutes is up. What we're suggesting is the equivalent of at the moment that we finish the Manhattan Project we should have in fact given the entire world the secrets to how to build a nuclear weapon based on the assumption that they would build a better faster cheaper and safer nuclear weapon. Now although the Rosenbergs did yet that information the reality is we continue to hold that information close because we believe we're the best stewards of it. And yet we're looking at the idea that you could give this to others and somehow they would make an effective vaccine when in fact it's even difficult for many of our companies to reliably make them. I say all of that because now let's talk about the Manhattan Project of data. The Manhattan Project of data is clearly going to be all the data with all the sensitivity of everything in our lives because it's all going to be collected. Where you are, what you're doing, the car you're in, the speed, the trajectory, whether you hit the turn signal, whether your eyes were looking at the dash, this is only the tip of the iceberg of what can be and inevitably will be collected. In London where cameras will decide whether to send you a ticket because you drove into the city but didn't have parking rights, that's been going for years and it's very effective clearly cameras are going to be a part of it. All of that data rights responsibility who's going to be in charge. So looking at the concept of you've got a public private partnership, you've got the government involved, there are two things that we have to figure out and Congress has a role in this. Will we absolutely protect the private sector's investment and their intellectual property so they get a predictable contractual return on what they put into the partnership? Then the flip side of it. Will the United States government maximize the benefit and the reusability of that data while protecting the privacy of the American people, while protecting the constitutional rights not just to the American people but candidly the people of the world because as we lead we are likely to lead for most of the world. Today there's no central decision on that. So for many people deep in the bureaucracy and Beth this is one of the reasons that I enjoyed our conversation and really saw it as a nexus. Agencies like Homeland Security and the FBI want and need certain data. They also are going to be the protectorates of that data not being misused or abused or even shared back with partners in an appropriate manner. And yet this conference which brings together people beyond just buyer, seller but in fact people thinking about the future of our partnership, of our 92 billion plus dollars of IT that the federal government spends every year. This has got to be one of the subjects that for the rest of this conference, the next conference later in the year and throughout. We've got to start asking when are we going to have a central and I hate the terms are but a central planner where we bring together and we figure out why is it the federal government buys the same data multiple times? Why is it we give away data only to buy it back after it's been massaged? Why is it the American people sometimes pay for data that they've already paid to be produced? And most importantly, how are we going to bring together an infinite amount of capability in a way that maintains, gives us all the benefits sort of the best of Google without the ads popping up? That's a question that I'm hoping you're all going to resolve between all of you because Congress can only legislate an idea that is matured. We cannot legislate the basic idea of go out there and do this because if we do, we're still going to have to come back and say now how do we implement it? And you know a decade after Fattara and the Data Act, we're still implementing it so I'm acutely aware of that. Lastly, and I didn't get my five minute warning so I'm probably doing okay, I'm going to touch on the rail, the biggest rail that I think is not being touched on regularly. I mentioned the 92 or so billion dollars of IT spending. Food for thought. In the first 50 to 100 years of our nation, the largest source of funding for the federal government was basically customs, alcohol, tobacco and other goods. That was how we funded almost everything we did. When the throughout that entire period, the second source was federal land sales and federal land leases. Then the IRS came around with the income tax and it became our largest source of revenue and oddly enough, land leases and land sales continued to be the second largest. And today as far as I know, it is still the second largest source of funding of the federal government is the wealth of our nation's natural resources, oil natural gas, grazing rights and so on. I'm going to put a question out to you that I don't have an answer to but I believe the answer should be evident to all of us if we look out 50 years. Why wouldn't the greatest value, a value that is created not just billionaires but multi-trillion dollar companies where now I think we have three trillion dollar companies and more coming. If we can have trillion dollar companies that are based on technology but more importantly based on harvesting data because let's face it, Google has nothing but the value of its intellectual property. I know all of you have those old speakers that talk back to you but trust me, that's not where the real money is being made. So now I'm going to propose that the greatest buyer of data is the federal government. The greatest accumulator of data including the census and others of the federal government is the federal government. So now the question is why is it today and if not today in 50 years why wouldn't data be the second or even I doubt the first but why wouldn't it eclipse land use and rental and oil rights. If we know that the accumulation of the kind of data I talked about briefly, if we know that that data is worth trillions of dollars in the free market, why is it it represents no revenue to the federal government and why is it that the federal government today isn't working in partnership with the many companies who can help it produce harvest and then in fact take to market that data in a format that doesn't just enhance our lives but it enhances our lives and reduces the burden of other taxes on running the federal government. So I'm not an appropriator, I'm not on ways and means but I see a future where the federal government is organized to look at data holistically, to look at the benefit and the protection holistically where key members of the president's government are concerned about your constitutional rights, your privacy rights and in fact getting a return on data which is being gathered to where you get the benefit in two ways, you get the benefit obviously of a more intelligent city, one in which that automobile racing too fast down a road that is seeing thousands of cars go down and knows that you cannot make that turn at that speed in that vehicle and alerts the driver and even potentially slows the driver down saving a terrible roll over. That technology is right here, it's today, it's not even tomorrow, it's available and it's coming in a matter of maybe hundreds of weeks but not thousands of weeks. That is coming but are we in fact looking at it holistically? So when Don asked me to come here and speak I thought about, well what do I talk about? I was obviously furious about the invalidating of patents, the whole idea we do that. I'm furious about breaking up companies simply because they're very large or because they don't like my politics. I'm furious about a lot of things but having taken two years off from Congress and now returning I'm also optimistic that in fact we are right on the edge of realizing three important things, there's always three things as you know when a speaker gets up here because if you use more than that you're going to miss more than one as a certain Texas governor discovered. One, we are in a race against competitors that we now can feel their breath right at our neck and whether it's China or other countries, we know that in fact we no longer have the huge lead so we know we have to do better. Two, we got to wake up call with the pandemic that life is both precious and fragile and that in fact we must be better at everything we do including tracking diseases around the world. When we talk about the importance of data the WHO clearly doesn't have a great system for tracking diseases and disease occurrences around the world and if they don't then we don't have an early warning. So we learned that but lastly we also learned something. We learned that our economy could shut down that old expression of a billion here a billion there pretty soon as real money could be made into a trillion here a trillion there and that our economy could collapse and it only came back when we found solutions to the problem. So I'm going to propose that in fact the secret to our world being at peace, the secret to Americans feeling safe in their homes and the secret quite frankly to us leading for the next hundred years and beyond is going to be that we look at these partnerships, the partnerships that we form right here between private sector ingenious companies and the government and we say you know what we need more than a win win of a good value for a good service. We need to link those services. We need to roll those up in those conferences that occur with the IT professionals in government. We need to roll those up into a comprehensive plan one that looks at cross pollinating all these programs one that looks to not just the success of sites not crashing and servers not being still using deck technology from the 80s but that next generation of data that does more than Google, more than any of our other tech companies were so proud of and it actually brings together value, value for the American people and I'm going to propose here value that can be monetized for both our partners and for the federal government because in the future it is likely that our oil and gas reserves will still have some value but the idea that today we pay net to acquire and compile data with no return on investment when that data can be and should be made available to the rest of our country and the rest of our world and it's valuable enough to create trillion dollar enterprises. So with that I want to thank you all for inviting an old guy a former technologist, turned politician back and I look forward to being here hopefully once again if I finish exactly when that one goes to zero. So thank you. Thank you, Congressman, before you leave I just have to say I have three people come up to me and say that is amazing. One two people want to have dinner with you and so I know how to come back to the Congress and Washington. I know his Congress is the schedule depends on it but this is your official invitation to continue this and we will give you as much time as you want in January. Twenty minutes is enough to provoke thought. Thank you very good. Thank you very much.",

        "transcript": " This is absolutely incredible. It's Friday afternoon. The cars can be seen assembling at the McDonald Batspar Hotel, which is the Rally HQ for the inaugural Lombard Rally Balfe. What a selection there is. In 1960s Minis, Volkswagen Beetles, Porsche 911 and 911 460s. Through many Ford Escorts, Toyota's, Vauxhall Chewettes and Triumph TR-7 V8 from the 1970s. Two Opel Mantas, Rover SD-1's and Audi Quattro's from the 1980s. Name search and blogQuist, McCray, 8-kin walker and Llewellin in attendance. The spectators are in for a treat the following day. Saturday morning and the cars make their way from the McDonald Batspar Hotel and travel the short distance to the start at Great Pultney Street to replicate the scene from 1976, 1918, 1983 and 1986 Lombard RAC rallies when the event started and finished here. Over 120 cars made the start, led away by the Welsh Rally winning mini of the late great Barry Wieso Williams, accrued here by Andy Ace Harrison with Peter Scott sat beside him. As the cars left Batham headed towards the first stage of the day at Longleet House, the fogger descended turning the morning into a traditional Lombard Rally from years gone by. A quick coffee break at the second stage held at Crickets and Thomas before the cars travel across the stage which is being run in the reverse direction of the 1976 RAC Rally event. On top of his compound which had been stage 45 in 1976 where joint fastest were Roger Clark and Penty O'Rickler stopping the clocks at one minute 53 seconds. Penty was leading the rally at this time but Roger would be the eventual rally winner both of them in four scores. Having taken lunch at the beach hotel in Minehead, the crews were nearing the end of the day but still had one more stage to tackle the iconic Paul Ock-Tol-Rohg. Having left Paul Ock-Tol-Rohg, crews made their way back to the rally HQ in Bath where they were able to relax and evening with a beer or two chatting and listening to guest speakers who were reliving moments during the organised meal. Jimmy and I fought very hard for the whole event. He said that the clatch would be there for you but he didn't believe me. He told him not to worry about the lights when I was catching him on the stage. But Jimmy by nine seconds the scariest fit was at the end of the last stage Margaret was there. Oh, Margaret McCray got me by the year. She did and she turned it very hard and she said this is the fifth time Jimmy is being second on this event you little Welsh ****. I do such a job.",

        "transcript": " Hello there, dear voters. My name is Scott Peters and I am currently the incumbent for California's 50-second district. You may wonder, why won't for me in this upcoming election? Well, in my close to five years in office, I have helped pass the patient production and affordable care act, a bill which allows millions of Americans across this country to obtain health care at a very low cost. As a result of many of my efforts to improve the health care coverage, this past year I was awarded the 2014 Visionary Award by the Nonpartisan California Health Care Institute for incorporating wireless technologies into the federal health care system as a result of the health savings through technology acts which I introduced. Among the other bills I have proposed last the Igniting American Research Act, which offers tax credits to institutions involved educational research. This bill would greatly help this district which accounts with one of the biggest research institutions in this nation, that being UCSD. While also increasing the number of job opportunities in America, as some scholars and political scientists predict it will generate over 150,000 jobs, therefore increasing the country's GDP by $66 billion. Another bill I have proposed and have recently reintroduced to Congress, as I know it's of interest of many of you, is the Federal Student Loan Refining Act, which aims to lower student loans interest rates. All this, in an effort to make it easier for you out there to obtain higher education, because I believe everyone should be given the opportunity to go to college. This would also help the thousands of students who are already in one of our top three district universities, and have been left to take out loans in an effort to pay for such education. For all the veterans out there in our district, I have introduced in my time in Congress the 21st Century Care Act for Military and Veterans, which aims to expand the health coverage given to new service members. It is the least I can do, draw the hard work you do in an effort to help this country. I'm currently also working on another campaign titled Fixed Congress Now, which you can check in my website. It aims to fix the way Congress currently runs. With this campaign, I plan on making it mandatory for Congress members to work at least five days a week like many Americans out there, as well as place a limit of 60 days in order to pass the bill. Along with increasing transparency by requiring members to disclose insurance subsidies and the amounts they spend on congressional trips. However, most importantly, I want to make government green or more eco-friendly by installing renewable energy programs in our federal buildings, as well as cutting down on our paper waste. I know protecting the planet is something many are you are worried about, especially after the recent drought our state has been through, but by installing such eco-friendly programs in our district and in our country, we can improve the state of our planet. Remember, by fixing Congress, we will therefore be able to build a better country and a better district. I am a fair believer at the foundation to creating a better nation, lies within each and every one of us. Please continue giving me the opportunity to help and improve San Diego, as well as for tuck your rights. I believe that we should all be treated with dignity and respect. That's why, among my major endorsers, lies the Human Rights Campaign, which knows that I am the right candidate to continue defending our rights. Hope you have an awesome year and don't forget to vote, Scott Feeters for Congress, this upcoming November. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " I feel that you have found someone that is going to fight for our principles. I ask you not to stand on the sidelines. I ask you to get involved. Congressional candidate Carl Demayo is coming under fire tonight by his opponent for a 2011 speech that he gave to local tea party members while running for mayor. Demayo and congressman Scott Peters are locked in a heated race for the 52nd Congressional District today in the first big attack in this election. The Peters campaign released a recording of the speech accusing Demayo of aligning himself with the tea party. And so I would ask you the tea party. Folks that I believe are now the conscience of the accountable government movement. I ask you to exercise that role in this coming election. Something else is political consultant Laura think. And Laura as you look at that what kind of an impact could a speech from three years ago have? Kimberly the tea party is a dirty word in the 52nd Congressional District. So the accusation could be incredibly powerful. In poll after poll after poll that I've seen over the years covering this district it's clear that a tea party Republican is not who they want. This is a moderate district and they would like someone that reflects their values. Now it's clear that Carl the Maya have affiliated himself with the tea party up. And so now we know that he was supported by groups that fund the tea party nationally but these are his own words. So this is a tough hit for him to take particularly as he works to make himself more of a moderate and position himself in that way. And here is a look now at the most recent ten news UT San Diego scientific poll which shows Demayo in the lead with 51% of the vote to Peters with 44% of the likely voters. So as we look at this how narrow are the margins if in fact some of the swing voters go one way or the other in this case. This is going to be an incredibly close race. You're looking at a snapshot over a hundred days outside the election. We know a lot can change right now. National reporters the Rothenburg political report the Cook political report say this is a pure toss up. So you're going to see some swinging from here till November. And that's probably why the statements are beginning to come out. Carl Demayo spoke's person issued this response late this afternoon. It's laughable that Scott Peters had to resort to deceptively splicing video clips completely out of context in order to call the gay pro choice government reformer on extremists. Well Scott Peters tactics show why Washington is broken and why he must go. What is your reaction to Carl? Well you'll note that you know if you're if you're on defense you're losing. So Carl goes immediately on offense here. You'll know that the two candidates are really trying to define one another. Here you see Carl going after Scott is a Washington insider. Scott will come back and say he's been there seven months and he's a bipartisan consensus builder. And Carl really has to defend his turf because his own words have to find him in this instance. It is really going to be a race to watch. It's going to be his off-site. Yeah, it's already coming out swing. And Demayo speech on pension reform is on our entire website. You can watch the entire clip. They're unedited by the Peters camp. Go to tennews.com.",

        "transcript": " I'm Patrick Gollum and I've had the pleasure of the last four months to be FilmStats campaign manager and I just want to let you know that the AP has just called the race and I'd like to introduce to you the next Lieutenant Governor of the State of Amago. Thank you very much. That's better applause than if I announced that the fire was going to open back up. I wrote this and so now I'm going to have a chance to say it. So I appreciate you all hanging in there and I'm very appreciative of the support of WBV for being the first to to call this one. Thank you very much. Well it's been a tough road and we started this journey about 11 months ago. It was December 2nd I believe in in Chittan County. I want to thank all of you for being here tonight and to support me and to support all of our candidates. My success tonight is not just my success alone. We ran a very strong campaign and it takes a whole lot more than one person to win a race like this one. There's so many little pieces that are all equally important like spokes on a wheel and we can't do anything without the wheel analogy. Without without each spoke lending equal support the wheel doesn't hold up. Looking back at the campaign there were a lot of memorable folks that formed that wheel and that propelled us forward to this very moment. So I'm going to go through some of them. Dick Mazza was the first one. Senator from Randall. I can always say thank you other than that. I mean you put the partisan aside and he has so much integrity and he has so much faith in me. Truly truly the man of Tom and sense and decency. So I thank him as much as anybody else because he was one of the first to do that. Thunder cow. Thunder cow. Many other toys and props we had along the way. Race cars, modeles. You name it we probably had it. We definitely use our imagination along this journey. Endorsements and support from many business groups. The first ones in the primary I've got to thank the EGC the auto dealers in particular the NRA. It takes a lot to stick your neck out in those times. Legislators there were so many legislators who came out but I think about the first one. I think that was the first one to step forward. But Tom Cots and Andonny who worked far behind and they wrote some very nice pieces of the paper and support of Bill Doyle as well. The race to victory tour. That was a really unique experience as we went through the state signing up new voters. They were disenfranchised and they hadn't. It was just incredible throughout the state. The number of people that weren't signed up to vote. So we went through some of those dealerships and started signing them up and now they're registered and proud of it. So I think we can all be proud of that. We're going to continue that because we move forward. The race to the finish tour yesterday. We've got 14 counties, 14 hours, over 500 miles and we thought for 14 minutes. Go Madden! Picture! It's an experience I'll never forget and I don't know what we were thinking of when we decided to do that. Above all its people. This isn't just my victory. It's your victory. I'm so glad to have had all of you on board with me over the last 10 months. I couldn't have done it without you. In particular, I want to thank my core campaign team. We've been with me on all my campaigns for the last 10 years. But this one was different. And they worked really hard for me this time around. Even though they may not have known what they were in for. Wayne, Tracy, Debbie, Maratha, Dave, Jeff, Michelle. I thank you for your loyalty and your friendship. And last but not least, Dick Wabi. Woo! I hate you. This isn't my campaign medorian every time I watch them while. I sometimes have to remind them that the door is unlocked. The music is a little bit open. It makes for a good balance. The new faces would join my pick crew this year and help me in this successful journey. Blend right, my treasurer, Nancy Driscoll, my communications person, and especially my campaign manager, that McDonald. What a wealth of knowledge and experience she brought to us. And she was the turning board in our campaign. I will never forget that. If she gave us legitimacy and she gave us focus. Thank you. APPLAUSE Many vermoners who put their sign in their yard, my sign, and talked about me to their neighbors. She taught and had that one right when he said, it's not just in the right of ways. It's in the front yards of their homes and their businesses. That makes a difference. Everyone who contributed to my campaign, whether it was financial, donation of time, for all the vermoners who contributed to talents, products, and services to this effort. I also want to thank, have a special appreciation to Thunder Road, Tom, Darlene Ken, and the entire racing community. As well as the community of contractors throughout the state, they are my competition. We're competing on a day-to-day basis. And they put that aside, and they work for me, and supported me. I thank them for that. Everyone who voted for me today, and over the past few weeks, I appreciate your confidence in me, the server month, as your ex-Lutinant governor. And I will do my very best not to let you down. I want to thank my family as well. My daughter's Eric and Rachel are here. Yay! My mom was in Florida right now. My dad, who died when I was 11, but continues to guide me and give me inspiration. Diana, beloved my life, and my aunt Mary, who's here tonight, is one of the most special people you could ever know. And I'm so blessed to have a large family, and that probably put me over the top. But you all inspired me to be the person I am today, and I thank you. I also, again, want to thank Governor Douglas and Lieutenant Governor Dubie for their leadership with the Republican Party. I'm honored to follow in Brian's footsteps, and to continue the tradition of strong, common-sense leadership, and tradition set by Brian and Jim Douglas. And before that, by people like George Aiken, and Dick Snelly, yesterday, I've got to mention this, yesterday, at the Democratic Party rally in Burlington, Vice President Joe Biden commented that we are not the Republican Party of George Aiken. But I'll do respect to our Vice President, by begging to differ. And I take exception to them. Whether you call us George Aiken, Dean Davis, Bob Stafford, or Dick Snelly Republicans, or Vermoners 2, or we're right here, and I'm one of them. My campaign, I was proud to have the support of many independents and moderate Democrats. I thank them for their vote of confidence, and I think we need to keep in mind that we do need to work together in a common-sense fashion, the Vermont way, to accomplish the goals we all share. My challenge to all the successful candidates tonight for Republican Democrat, or independent, is not only to fulfill our promises, but to prove that we can work together as Vermoners. As for all of us here in this room, we are the party of George Aiken, and I'm proud to be a part of that. Although my race is over, the governor's race is not. I'll be anxious to see the results, and also returns to continue to come in during the night. But I thank you for being here, and I thank you for celebrating with me, and I appreciate it. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Hey listen, I'm not good at coming out here and faking it for 10 years. No, we got whoop, we got whoop and we didn't understand that you we ran a campaign that would have been great in 1996. We had TV ads in Dordnachon and these guys built an online infrastructure with the Joe Rogans and everything else. If we thought Rush Limbaugh gave us trouble in the 90s or Fox News gave us trouble in the early 2000s. We built 2000 Fox News and 2000 Rush Limbaugh's all throughout the internet and we didn't even know they were doing it and we got egg on our face and we got a big, big job to look into ourselves in the mirror and figure out how we got beat this bad. Scott what if you were put another hat on for a second if you were going to talk to Democrats from your perspective and go easy but what would you pick out and advise them where did it go wrong? Well, I think the Democratic Party and the eyes of a lot of working class voters and the eyes of a lot of men who overwhelmingly turned out for Trump in this election kind of either Democratic Party as a professional fainting society. You know, we're offended by everything. We don't have our eye on the real ball here which is people being crushed in the economy or we don't have our eye on the border. We don't have our eye on the world chaos. What we have our eye on is running around scolding everyone and being offended by everyone. I mean, it's no way to run a political party and then be surprised when average every day working people turn out against you. So if I were the Democrats, I mean, it's a time for soul searching. I feel for a brother van a little because, you know, the Republicans have been there too. But the reality is you just have to ask yourself a couple of questions. Who are we and who do we stand for? What do we represent? What are our actual values? And I think if they ask themselves those questions and answered them honestly, they'd find out that the only people they really stand for are very wealthy people who were not as crushed by inflation, people who have college degrees who live in and around college campuses and in urban areas. That's it. That's pretty much what the Democratic Party has been reduced to. What do you say, man? I think Republicans have done a brilliant job of framing us that way. And I think we've helped them a lot because a lot of the stuff that we say does fall into the pity party, crybaby society stuff. I think that that's right. The tragedy to me is that what Joe Biden and Kamaharis actually did and what they're promising to do really was responding to working class needs. A lot of stuff in the inflation reduction act was really trying to help ordinary people. They ran on a campaign to try to get $6,000. Everybody's having a new baby. $25,000. People want to have a house to help small businesses. There was an agenda there, but we did not do a good job of talking about it. The crybaby took up all the airspace and then they built a machine. Don't forget the Republicans built a machine online to magnify our mistakes and to mask their failures. And what we did was run a bunch of crappy ads that everybody hated and spend a billion dollars doing it. So there is a core there that is good, but we dropped the ball in the parking lot. We thought we were on the football field. We weren't here on the football field. We were in the parking lot. And we got it. We got to look in the mirror. One of the most powerful members of the Democratic Party is now blaming President Biden for Vice President Kamala Harris' election loss. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi telling the New York Times Democrats may have had a better shot if the president had stepped aside sooner. And we're back now with our panel, Van Jones and Scott Jennings. Thanks for sticking around both of you, Van, especially you. I do want to know, I'm not sure how good it does anybody looking backward at this point. However, I am curious what you make of the former House Speaker's comments. Well, listen to the whole interview. And she was doing all the things she could to try to get out and answer the question. She asked the question multiple times in multiple ways. Eventually, you have to give an opinion. And I don't think her opinion is wrong in hindsight. Don't forget now, Joe Biden was doing better than he is now. And after the midterm elections, when you have to make a decision to get in or get out, he was just coming off of an incredibly successful legislative session that we had done really well in the midterms. And I think he started to feel like, hey, everybody keep telling me, I can't do this, I can't do that. I'm winning, I'm winning, I'm winning. And he just went a bridge too far. I don't think anybody now can honestly say they were glad that Joe Biden stayed in. So I think, plus, he's just being honest about that. But I think people think that she went on there to go after Joe Biden. She did not. She got asked that question. She couldn't get out of the box if she had to give an answer. Right. I mean, not yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Scott, do you think Biden was a key factor in Trump's victory? Oh, of course. I mean, look at the Biden of it all. Of course, I mean, he's had an under 40% approval rating since August of 2021. The American people have been very unhappy with him. Yes, Democrats did a bit better in the 2022 midterm. But I think it was in spite of Biden, honestly, and the House Republicans did actually win the National Popular Vote in the 22 midterm. People keep forgetting that. We did have some bobbles and some Senate races. I think they totally overread what happened in that midterm. But on top of that, what I find particularly troubling is that all these Democrats who were now looking back on Biden and he shouldn't run, he shouldn't have done this. These are the same people who were all too happy to go on television every day and tell us that Joe Biden was sharp as a tack. Everything was fine. He was up to everything. And we now know there's huge amount of evidence that he wasn't, that he really was diminished, that he really wasn't up to the job. And yet they were pushing that campaign forward anyway. They finally dumped him after the debate when they couldn't hide it anymore. To me, the reckoning here is, when did everybody know Joe Biden was diminished? Why did they lie for so long? Are we going to get a full accounting of that? So I don't think Democrats have anyone to blame here, but themselves. Joe Biden is going to go down in history as a pretty terrible president, I believe. And on top of that, if you're a Democrat, you think about how he ran his campaign the first time. I'm running to restore the soul of the nation, to rid us of Trump and Trumpism. Today, Donald Trump is stronger than he's ever been, more popular. And his agenda is ascendant in our politics. It is a complete and total political failure. I mean, Van, that last part of what Scott just said is true. I mean, Trump did win and is more ascendant than he's ever been, even despite January. Even despite all the stuff. Did you think I didn't hear it when he'd scoff or say it at the end? I can't use the one. Yes. What do you want me to do? Can I leave? Listen. Help us understand, Van. He want me to do. Listen, Jessica, Jessica, we get to have to charge Van at 500 bucks an hour for these Saturday night stuff. We got to get a couch in here for him. This reverse therapy. This reverse therapy. I'm not making me pay. It's not a therapy. It's not a therapy. So, I'm loving. Look, there were some people, and I got to say our colleague, David Axelrod from the very beginning, beat up and beat up because he kept saying this is not going to work. And I'm concerned about his age. And he got, I mean, he got beat up worse than I've ever seen in Democrat. Get beat up. And he was right. There were people who had to curse, not enough of them. And Scott Jennings is right. There was something going on. And if it wasn't going on in 2021 or 2022, by the time you got to that debate, there was clearly something off about Joe Biden. I love Joe Biden. Joe Biden gave me an opportunity when nobody else did. But there's just a reality here. Now look, it is important to look back and learn these lessons. This is not a blame game. This is not a finger pointing. This is the part of the grieving process and also the reassessment process that any mature party should go through. This is just a hurts because literally this time last weekend, we thought we were going to run this dude off to the world stage. And now we got to deal with him and all his friends and his family members and everybody else on the stage, all happy and we're crying in our beer. So it's a tough weekend right now. But Scott's not wrong. But I think where Scott is underestimating Joe Biden, I think history will be kind of Joe Biden as a years go by. I think Joe Biden did some things that were very important. Trump talked about infrastructure a week every week and never did it. Joe Biden actually got it done. We had a real problem with our technology infrastructure being off-shored with the chips act he brought some of that stuff back home. Joe Biden did some stuff that we can all be proud of as Americans and as the years go by, those things will shine through. But right now, you know, people are looking at him and looking at common and looking at all of us and saying what the heck did you guys do? And I have a done cap on myself because I underestimated Donald Trump and his machine. And I did it every night. And that's true. I mean, I will say to Vian because he worked for, I mean, Republicans are kind of thankful for Biden and previously Barack Obama. I mean, it was Obama's presidency that gave us Trump the first time and it's Joe Biden's presidency that made Donald Trump stronger than ever. So we just want to say thank you to Obama. Can I leave? We just want to say thank you guys. You guys have delivered us and we're going to have American patriotism and economic optimism again. And it goes right back to Obama. So thank you guys. I can't wait for the good terms. You guys are going to overreach. Just two years. You're going to overreach. We're going to get you. But right now, it sure hurts. Vian, I do want to ask you, President Biden and from President Trump are going to meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday, which is kind of, you know, a norm in these sorts of, when we have a transition of power, what do you expect to see from that? Well, I'm sure you'll be just like the last time they met in the Oval Office and you know, when Trump brought him over and said, I'm going to wait a minute. Like, this is actually not a norm. It's a norm that was blown out of the water when the last time President Trump was sitting in that office, he refused to even honor the man. And so it does show, I think, something important that Joe Biden is not up here refusing to let the guy come in, refusing to speak with them. Common Harris is not organizing an insurrection. There's nobody going around saying that the election was stolen. We have a mature party that respects democracy. I hope the Republican Party will become a mature party that respects democracy, even when they lose. They respect it when they win, at least under Donald Trump. So I'm glad, I hope that this is the end of that kind of nonsense and that people will follow Joe Biden's example into feed and not Donald Trump.",

        "transcript": " Mr. Speaker, the majority is once again choosing to engage in a partisan, unproductive, and unserious messaging exercise that they have dubbed energy week. In 2023, the United States produced more oil and gas than any other country ever, and exported unprecedented amounts of liquefied natural gas to our allies across the world. Simultaneously, 2023 was a record year for combined utility-scale solar, wind, and energy storage installations across the country. These clean energy projects can be found in nearly all congressional districts in all 50 states. My friends on the other side of the aisle claimed to be champions of an all-of-the-above energy strategy, but they're completely silent about these massive accomplishments that are not only driving significant investments to areas across the country, but are producing cheap, clean, American energy. This is probably because so many of these winds were made possible by the historic bills that house Democrats passed last Congress, like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. I was proud to include in those bills several of my priorities, including combating methane emissions and encouraging the development of transmission infrastructure, by ensuring the federal government has the tools it needs to step in and stop excessive permitting delays. However, the laws we passed last Congress will not be enough. We are facing extraordinary growth in energy demand from electric vehicles, AI, data centers, and the reshoring of domestic manufacturing, again thanks to the efforts and leadership of President Biden and his administration. But we are lagging far behind China, which is dwarfing us in manufacturing, construction of clean energy resources, and the extraction and refining of critical minerals like nickel and cobalt. We need an unprecedented level of clean energy development and deployment to meet our climate goals and avoid catastrophe. If the majority is interested in talking about a long-term energy strategy to maintain affordability and reliability, we need finally to talk about transmission and the grid. And we also need to work on speed. We will still fail if we let all the money we've set aside sit in the bank by making good energy projects wait years for permits to come through and further delays if bad actors and nervous neighbors take them to the court again and again. It's extremely frustrating that during energy week, we are actually taking the time to vote on whether strong regulations on methane emissions are even necessary, or whether oil and gas producers should cover the costs of unplugged or abandoned wells. Are you kidding me? Of course, we need to regulate methane, and of course, oil and gas companies should pay to clean up for the messes that they made. How can Republicans say they support clean energy while simultaneously fighting against common sense regulations on methane and not even engaging in how to expand and upgrade the grid? The bills we're considering this week take us farther away from the solutions to the problems we're facing, and I am proud to oppose every single one of them. Our country prides itself on accomplishing big things together whether it's winning world wars, constructing interstate highway system, or discovering the next big medical breakthrough. We should be voting on my faster act, so transmission lines aren't stuck jumping between local state and federal agencies for the permits they need. We need to thoughtfully streamline the judicial review process for all energy projects so that developers, agencies, and petitioners aren't in limbo for years. We need certainty, not an unreliable and inefficient, inefficient review process, and everything I said about that today can and should be bipartisan. So I will say to my Republican colleagues, let's look beyond just oil and gas, truly invest in all of the above energy strategy that looks to the future instead of of cleaning onto the past. Thank you and I yield back.",

        "transcript": " in so many families and communities, including my own, if you really need something done, you call grandma. And right now, we really need something done. We need the Senate to pass the Billback Better Act. And our message is very clear. Care can't wait. Care can't wait. That's right. That's right. You know, next week, the last child tax credit check is going to go out. And after that, the program is going to expire. So when you hear some of my colleagues say that what we need is more time, there's no rush. They're clearly not listening to the American people, because people are counting on us. And if we don't get this done, a lot of families who are expecting assistance on January 13th aren't going to get it. In my district in San Diego alone, the monthly payments have already helped 129,000 kids, 129,000 kids, just in my district. We've gone $32.7 million to local families. And nationwide, we've seen a massive reduction in child poverty. So it makes no sense to lift millions of kids out of poverty for a few months, only to let them fall back down. So I am proud to join Grammys here, Grammys in San Diego, Grammys across the country, all of the care workers to keep working to get this bill over the finish line, because it's not just the child tax credit. We need the Build Back Better Act to establish paid leave, create free and universal pre-K, lower child care, and family care costs, raise wages for care workers. And that's what makes this legislation truly historic. Because for so long, we based our economic policies around men. We focus on job creation and wages in historically male fields and we left everyone else on the sidelines. We assume the domestic and care responsibilities would be taken care of by unpaid and underpaid women. But this time is different. And it's because of the work of those with us today and so many others who demanded better. And that includes all the Grammys, because we certainly would not be here without all of you. That's right. Doing things the way we have always done them just isn't good enough anymore. It's costing our economy a trillion dollars in lost GDP because millions of parents and caregivers can't afford the care they need to work. It's costing us another trillion dollars due to the adverse effects of childhood poverty. But we don't have to accept this. Because the investments that we make and kids pay off across a lifetime, we actually save $7 for every $1 we invest in early childhood programs. So there are a lot of parents and grandparents who know that the way things are just isn't working. There are too many families without affordable child care, too many primary caregivers without paid leave, too many families having to drain their bank accounts to afford care. And it's because of all of your work that I truly believe we're going to actually make change.",

        "transcript": " It is really a solemn day. Today marks, as you all know, one year of horrific suffering and violence in Sudan. Today marks a year of the war that has created the biggest internal displacement crisis in the world and one of the worst hunger crisis that we've seen. This war has forever changed and destroyed the lives of too many Sudanese children. Millions of children, millions of children don't have enough food or water to drink and they haven't gotten their essential vaccines. One in three Sudanese children can't go to school right now. And pretty soon, it's likely that no child will be able to go to school in Sudan. That leaves them vulnerable to displacement, to recruitment by armed groups, to sexual violence. Honestly, every time I think about this, I'm heartbroken. No child should have to go through this. Three weeks ago, I was in Eastern Chad with Senator Cory Booker and Congressman Barbara Lee. We were the first members of Congress to visit with Sudanese refugees at the Chad student border since the start of the war. We heard horror stories about entire villages that fled Sudan and came to Chad, leaving because violence and lack of food. We heard stories about the RSF coming to villages committing sexual violence and killing people. I have been to a number of refugee camps in my life. So I think I have never seen kids as traumatized as the kids I saw in these refugee camps. It was clear that they were still carrying this heavy trauma, trying to process it and heal, while trying to survive in the refugee camps. We can't look away. We can't ignore this crisis. We can't pretend this isn't happening right here. We have a responsibility all of us to stop this suffering and ensure that there's justice and accountability for these crimes. That's why I urge, I'm calling on RSF and SAF Book to lay down their arms and stop the fighting. And I have also been calling on it and we all need to do more to call on the United Arab Emirates, the UAE, to stop funding the RSF, which has only prolonged this war and made it more deadly. And once we finally get the violence to end and the humanitarian assistance in, we need to make sure that we pursue justice and accountability so that we can stop the cycle of violence and ensure healing for the Sudanese people to move forward. Even after witnessing and experiencing such unimaginable traumas, the Sudanese people that I met with had an incredible strength. They had hope for the future. You know, I was in Darfur in the summer of 2022. And I think about the children I met there all the time. I wonder if they've survived this horrific war. If they're safe, if they made it out, that's why we cannot give up. We can't walk away and we cannot abandon them. That's right. I will keep fighting for the future of Sudan and I know that all of you will too. Thank you all so much for being out here and for everything you do.",

        "transcript": " California. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I rise today to fight for kids, parents, and guardians, and educators in San Diego and across the country. All parents and guardians want for their kids is for them to grow up safe, healthy, and happy, and have the tools needed to confidently and successfully go out into the world. So obviously, they should be involved in their kids' education and shaping their minds and lives. But HR5 is not the solution. I think we can all agree that educators can be some of the most influential people in our kids' lives. They have the power to inspire lifelong learning, they can help foster creativity and curiosity, and teach children new information and perspectives. But HR5 fails to value educators. It fails to acknowledge or even address that teachers are overworked and underpaid, fueling the burnout that's created a nationwide teacher shortage that was exponentially worsened by the pandemic. HR5 fails to address school safety. There have been 322 school shootings this year alone. Just yesterday, there was a shooting at a Denver High School. And by failing to act on gun violence in schools, we're allowing an entire generation to grow up with so much trauma. Trauma of school shooting drills, of growing up watching school shootings on the news, of wearing bulletproof backpacks to school, and knowing that one day, it could save your life. And yet, HR5 doesn't even attempt to proactively end the gun violence epidemic at schools. It only permits parents and guardians the right to a notification when violence at a school occurs. My colleagues glaze over the causes of real violence at our nation schools, like proper investments in school-based mental health programs, social emotional and cultural competency professional development for educators and administrators, disciplinary measures that eradicate the cradle to prison pipeline, and more importantly, human control measures to ensure that our youth are safe from school shootings. We need parents and guardians to be involved in the classroom, because too often, it's all on teachers to make up for emotional support learning and care in the classroom that should also be provided at home. But HR5 doesn't give all parents and guardians the tools for constructive involvement, and unfairly empowers a very narrow set to dictate what all students learn about. It will open the door to book bans and censorship to control what students learn and read about. Neglecting important parts of history like the civil rights movement and learning about people's identities, it would also mandate schools to out LGBTQ plus students to their parents, violating students' privacy, and potentially exposing them to harm in the process. And while I'm thankful that the Rules Committee supported two of my amendments, it's shameful that they rejected my amendment to ensure that teaching about the Holocaust and anti-Semitism in schools should be taught with the acknowledgement that those actions were immoral. Amid skyrocketing anti-Semitic rhetoric, especially from some of my colleagues in this body, and growing violence targeting the Jewish community, Congress needs to use its power to end hatred and discrimination against Jews. And that work starts with our actions and ensuring that never again is a reality, by teaching about the Holocaust and the lingering hate that still exists today. And in the height of irony, this bill even includes a sense of Congress that all public elementary and secondary schools should have opportunities to learn the history of the Holocaust and anti-Semitism, but that means very little if we're unwilling to mandate how wrong and immoral those actions were. This bill is a disservice to our kids, parents, and guardians, teachers, and to our future. By not providing kids the tools to be engaged thoughtful citizens, so we should take the opportunity to improve this bill. My amendment eliminates the at-no-cost, unfunded mandate embedded within the bill that would require schools that are already underfunded and underresourced to be burdened with printing out professional development and curriculum materials at zero cost. I agree that parents should have access to school curriculums, most of which are already published online. However, if my colleagues believe parents should have this right so strongly, then they should provide additional funding for school systems to be able to comply. We want all parents and guardians to be involved in the classroom. This is a simple, common-sense solution that removes a potentially costly barrier for school systems that are already struggling to maintain their budgets. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to remove the no-cost provisions in HR5 to bring all parents and guardians to the table for their kids learning. Parents and guardians should be active participants in kids' education, but that doesn't mean we should lose sight of school safety and discrimination supporting teachers and ensuring a well-rounded curriculum that prepares kids for the futures. Thank you. I reserve the answer my time.",

        "transcript": " I'm Sarah Jacobs and I'm running for Congress in California's 53rd Congressional District. Definitely a night now. I'm a nerd so it's the weeds by Vox media. Okay, honestly I don't know because I'm not a lot of hepatectocs because it's a national security threat. I'm Jewish and a quote that I find really helpful and times like what we're living through is one from the Talmud and it is don't be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. Love justly now, walk humbly now. You are not obligated to finish the task but neither are you free to abandon it. Window I love sleeping on airplanes. Good old voice club by Casey Musgraves. I believe we need a new generation of leaders who will look at old problems with the new lens and address them with the urgency that they require. Look at new problems that we're not addressing like new technology. I don't know about you but when I see all those hearings with Mark Zuckerberg and others with a bunch of people who clearly have never used Facebook or Instagram or TikTok, I get very frustrated and also because it's not just about policies that we need to think about differently but also how we do things differently and we need a new generation of leaders who will find ways to listen to everyone and respect everyone and work together to get things done. Yes. If millennials were adequately represented, we would have about 90 members of Congress and instead we barely have 30 and it's only because of the huge numbers that we elected in the last election cycle. And that matters because as a young woman, I didn't need the need to movement to know that sexual harassment in the workplace was a problem. I lived it and as young people, we are the ones who will be dealing with the consequences of decisions being made or not being made right now, long-riving anybody else on issues like climate change and gun violence prevention. And also because we are being impacted by so many of the decisions being made and we should have a seat at the table and we have a different perspective. You know millennials graduated in the great recession and that meant that so many of us couldn't find jobs. We couldn't buy homes. We're still dealing with the consequences and we're seeing the next generation dealing with the same issues which is why I proposed an unemployment insurance for graduating seniors, graduating students based on their expected future earnings instead of the earnings they had while they were in school because really it's the job they were going to get that they're missing out on because of this catastrophic economy that we have right now. Yes. Oh goodness. As a young woman you can imagine there are so many things to choose from. Let's see. I've been told I should wear a bikini in ad so that men would want to vote for me. A head of woman told me she didn't want to vote for me because she thought her husband would be for a woman. Like lady, I don't want your husband. I've been told my hair should look more voluptuous that my voice is too high or I speak too fast that I just didn't look right sitting at the head of a table but they weren't sure why. I once thought I was recruiting a volunteer who turns out only wanted to see if I'd go on a date for them. Yeah, running for Congress is a young woman can be a challenge. I say a few things. The first is regardless of how hard it is the only way it's going to get better is if people see more young people, women, people of color, in leadership positions because the only way they're going to get used to seeing and hearing and respecting leadership that looks different than what they're used to is by seeing it. So if we want things to get better, we have to jump in. The second thing I'll say is that I see a lot of people who get lost by focusing too much on what they want to be instead of what they want to do. So you should find the problem that you really want to solve and then figure out the best way and where you can have the most impact solving it and that might be running for office and it might be working for a non-profit. I might be doing advocacy but as long as you stay focused on that problem that you want to solve, you won't go wrong. And lastly, especially as young women, I feel like we are told and we really internalize that there's always someone out there who knows more than we do or who's more qualified than we are. But I can tell you, you should do your homework absolutely. But you're enough right now and we need you and we need your voice. So if you think you have a contribution that you can make and that you can make a difference for your community, you should run it and don't let anyone tell you not to. So thank you for listening and watching. Again, I'm Sarah Jacobs, running for Congress in the 53rd Congressional District and I'd be very honored to earn your vote. And don't forget that voting is happening now. This election could not be more important. That means we need all of you to get out and vote. So please vote early and vote by mail by November 3rd.",

        "transcript": " is the youngest member of California's Congressional delegation. And the third youngest member in Congress. Do I have any sisters here from California today? Congresswoman Jacobs serves as the freshman representative to the House Democratic Steering Committee and Policy Committee and sits on the House Committee for Foreign Affairs. The House Armed Services Committee and the House Select Committee on Economic Disparity, Fairness and Growth. proudly representing California's 53rd Congressional District, please give a big sisters welcome to Congresswoman Sarah Jacobs. All right, one more shout out for the Californians over here. All right, and I know we've got some San Diego's in the rooms. Local 619, where are you guys? All right, well thank you so much Senad for the introduction and for everything you're doing for the Carpenters and this craft in our community. And thank you to General President MacKarren, who I know couldn't be with us today and to General Secretary Treasurer Flynn for having me here. I'm also happy that we have representation from the Biden and Trudeau administrations. Wendy Chen Hoon and Minister Patty Haydu, thank you so much for being here. It was so nice meeting with some of you ladies yesterday and I'm so excited to be here with you again this morning, mostly to thank you for all the work that you're doing for this industry and to make it one that actually works for women. It's really exciting to be here in Vegas with so many people who share my values because let me tell you that is not always the case in Washington, DC. But I know all of us here in this room, we're fighting for a better future for our country, where one job is enough, where we don't have to worry about accessing health care and wondering how to pay for it, where we feel safe at work and have an opportunity to grow and learn and are treated with dignity and respect. And all of you here, you're the heart and soul of these efforts. The sisters in the Brotherhood have been breaking down barriers each and every day, proving that women can and do belong in what's otherwise been a man's world. So yesterday I did a tour and I saw the poster of Margaret Elling's who became the first woman initiated into the United Brotherhood of the Carpenters in 1935. And since then, we know that women have been proving your worth on the job site time and again and have been strong active members in the union. But I think all of us here in this room know it wasn't easy for Margaret then and it still isn't easy for many of you now. I know I was talking with you and you shared some stories of sexism and skepticism of women carpenters arriving on a job site and the foreman questioning your ability to do the job of assuming you're an apprentice when you have 20 years of experience of how you're often the only woman on a job site with maybe 300 men and believe me, I've been there too. My entire career I've often been the only woman in the room or the youngest person in the room and usually both. And people don't see my experience first, they see my gender and they see my age. So before I finally decided to run for Congress, I was 28 at the time when I first decided to run and I had my friends write down all the meanest things they could possibly think they could say about me and read it to me over and over again to get me used to what I might hear on the campaign trail. I thought it would help me grow a thick skin and prepare me for what it would be like to run. But honestly nothing could have prepared me for the constant and cool comments that I got about my appearance and my gender. How I should look sexier so that men would want to vote for me. Maybe I should film ads in a bikini. How my hair wasn't voluptuous enough. My voice was too high, I speak too quickly. How I just didn't look right sitting at the head of the table but they weren't sure why. I know why. How maybe I should consider running for school board instead of Congress because I'm just not ready and then two seconds later those same people would go to another Democratic candidate who's a man and younger than me and tell him that he was the future of our party. People calling me honey, sweetie, baby when I'm sharing my ideas. And even now as a member of Congress, I'm regularly mistaken for a staffer or an intern. And recently I was in a classified briefing on a very serious topic and had a policy disagreement with a colleague of mine. And instead of engaging on the policy disagreement, he just in front of everyone called me a silly little girl. So let's be clear about one thing. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being an intern or a staffer. Our offices and job sites wouldn't run without them. But it is, yeah. I know we've got a lot of apprentices in the room here. But there is a problem when people are so unfamiliar with seeing women in positions of leadership that they assume that being an intern or an apprentice is the only thing we could possibly be. And we know that these comments, these subtleties of sexism which sometimes are not very subtle, are designed to undermine women's credibility and worth and are pervasive in every professional field and area of our society. That's one of the biggest reasons I thought it was important for me to run for office, to fight this sexism head on, to hopefully make it easier for the next young woman, to make sure we're having the discussions that represent diverse perspectives and life experiences, and that these discussions turn into policies that reflect our country and ultimately help those most in need. Because we need people to see leadership that looks and sounds different. There are so many things that are so normal to us and our existence as women that are somehow treated as taboo or separate or not important. A few months ago in a speech on the House floor, I talked about using a period tracking app. I wasn't trying to be radical. I was just talking about my concern with data privacy that are very real for millions of people. And I want to talk to some of my colleagues after the speech about those concerns. To talk about legislation I was proposing to solve the problem. Man, you have never seen grown men squirm as much as when I tried to talk to them about my period. So many of them had no idea that women track their periods, let alone that there are apps that help you do it or how any of them work. And I found out later that I was the first person in at least 35 years, probably ever, to talk about my period on the House floor. But that's pretty wild because having your period is one of the most basic parts of so many of our lives. It happens every month. For like half the country. And our government is pretending like it's something to be ashamed of. But we have to talk about these things. We have to talk about them so that our policies actually reflect the needs of our country. These aren't side issues. These are kitchen table issues. And across every industry, not just Congress, we need more diversity to reflect our country. We need more unions to fight for working people, more women, carpenters, more women in leadership, and more mentors for those coming up. And before anyone goes there, I'm not saying that there's no place for older men or men in general in Congress or in the carpenters or anywhere else far from it. It's just that their perspectives and lived experiences are already well represented in just about every workforce and job site. While ours just aren't. And that's why the work you all are doing, encouraging and helping each other getting more sisters into the brotherhood is so important. Because we know that we're going to need new policies. We're going to need policies that encourage women and families like equal pay and affordable and accessible childcare and access to contraception and abortion services. And the lack of women representation and women leadership is also helping to drive this new wave of anti-women rhetoric and policies. And that's painfully clear when Republican men and sadly sometimes women talk about calculating your pregnancy, not knowing that for instance, one month pregnant is actually just the first day of your misperiod. And that's why it's so important that we have more people around the room. And that's why like many of you, I was horrified and outraged and so freaking angry when the Supreme Court overturned Roby Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. Because as one of the very few women of reproductive age in Congress, this was very personal to me. Reproductive healthcare is literally my health care. It is the only doctor I often go to. And I know we have a big room with people from all over the country. So let's be clear about one thing. We can have different opinions on abortion and still agree that the Supreme Court and the government has no business making decisions about our bodies and taking away our rights to decide if, when and how to start a family. The Supreme Court does not know more about my body than I and my health care provider do. And the bottom line is people are going to die because of this decision, especially women of color, women living in poverty, rural, women, young women and folks in the LGBTQ plus community. So now we have to fight. We have to fight for our own rights. We have to fight for our daughters because we cannot allow them to grow up in a world where they have fewer rights than our mothers and our grandmothers did. And I'm proud that the House of Representatives under the amazing leadership of Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already passed legislation that would codify the right to abortion into law that would codify the right to contraception into law that would protect those who cross state lines for abortion access. But we can't stop there. Because the post-row era is not going to look like the pre-row era. This is not our grandmother's fight. We have a lot more tools at our disposal now, but so do they. And in the 50 years since Roe v. Wade was decided, our society has created a vast digital surveillance system. One that can and is going to be used against people who are seeking abortions and those who are helping them. That's why in June, after the draft decision was leaked, I introduced the My Body My Data Act. It's a bill that would create a new national standard to protect personal reproductive and sexual health data. Because right after that draft decision came out, I heard from so many friends, constituents, peers who were all worried about their reproductive health data, from period or fertility tracking apps, from Google searches, that this data could be used against them. I mean, I use a period tracking app. I get it. It's scary. And of course, it wasn't just Democrats who were reaching out to me. I heard from so many constituents from across my district from every political spectrum who are worried about what comes next. And right now we should be worried because right now there is no protection for that data. It can be sold to the highest bidder. It can be used however someone wants it to. This is a scary time. And while states across the country are banning abortions, support for families who actually have children is basically non-existent. And look, I think a lot of you, I know a lot of you might be Republicans yourselves. So let me just say that the Republican Party in Congress, my colleagues in Congress, they aren't the party of small government or protecting personal liberties anymore. They aren't fighting to make our community safer from mass shootings. They aren't fighting for more people to access health care. In fact, they're actively fighting against all of us having more control over our own lives. Last month, we voted on a bill to codify the right to contraception, to birth control. Guess how many Republicans in Congress voted for it? Eight. Eight. Out of over 200. Contr reception. Apparently, we have to fight for our right to birth control now. Right? And then they're shouting to anyone who will listen that if you have a kid before you're ready or if you want fair wages and protections at work, well, you're just not doing it right. You're just not willing to pay your dues. So let me tell you after taking the Tory yesterday of your training facility, I feel very confident in saying this. Any one of you would be an awesome member of Congress. And I can guarantee you, I guarantee you, my colleagues would never be able to build a high rise. So if my colleagues are against policies that protect the health and safety of kids, what do they stand for and who do they represent? Not me and not the millions of Americans like all of you who want more for the next generation. You know, the other day I was on a panel with a Republican colleague of mine who was trying to tell the audience that we can't afford investments in childcare. So here's the thing. We save six dollars for every one dollar the government invests in quality, early care and education programs. Policies that investing kids have the highest return on investment. Not to mention the fact that the US economy loses a trillion dollars to the cost of childhood poverty every year and another trillion dollars to the fact that many women aren't in the workforce in part because they can't find childcare. So don't listen to anyone who tells you that we can't afford to invest in childcare because the fact of the matter is we can't afford not to. And that's what real physical responsibility is. You know, my colleagues talk a lot about physical responsibility. They talk a lot about taking control of your own lives, pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. They're not letting us have access to birth control. They're not giving us childcare to watch our kids while we go to work. I'm not sure exactly what control they think that we have. If we want more women in the workforce, if we want more parents in the workforce, we have to make childcare more accessible and affordable. And I know many of you know this personally. If you don't have reliable, affordable childcare, making it to work on time focusing on your job can be nearly impossible. And if you're struggling to find childcare every day or you're worried if your kids are safe and healthy, you can't fully focus on your job. And you're certainly not able to grow and seek new opportunities. And I was talking about this with some of you yesterday and you shared with me that finding childcare was a major impediment to being able to do your jobs. That some of you have to work nights so that your family can watch your kids while they sleep because it's too hard to find childcare during the day. That you're getting by asking your friends and family to help out, but you don't know how much longer they'll be able to do it for. This is a crisis in San Diego where I'm proud to represent. It's one of the wealthiest counties in the country. We've got Fortune 500 companies. We've got mansions on the beach. And yet before the pandemic, 70% of families with children under five didn't have access to the childcare they needed. And we know the pandemic has only made it worse. In the first year of the pandemic alone, more than 500 childcare centers closed in San Diego. That's why I've been working every day I've been in Congress to address the childcare crisis and improve our social safety net. Because we need childcare and we need more than childcare. We need systemic change to our entire social safety net to support kids and families. Allowing kids to live in poverty is a policy choice. A choice that my colleagues are making every single day. And we can't work around the edges any longer. We have to take big steps to rebuild a more just and equitable society when that invests in young people and in families and gives everyone dignity and agency over their own lives. Because that's what this all really boils down to. Dignity. The universal inherent dignity in being able to make decisions about your own lives. The dignity of having your basic needs met. The dignity of being able to support your families. And no matter what job you're in from childcare to the construction industry, one job should be enough. And especially when the government is investing in these jobs, they should be good jobs where workers are treated with dignity and respect and that means safe working conditions, a living wage and decent benefits. I fought hard to pass the bipartisan infrastructure law and I'm so proud that Davis Bacon protections applied to so many of the construction projects guaranteeing these are jobs with competitive wages and benefits. It's a basic labor protection and we have to keep fighting until Davis Bacon applies to all federal construction spending. And we need to do more to ensure that more people, especially women and people of color, have access to good union jobs which will boost employment in the construction industry and make sure folks have the support and resources they need to stay in the industry. And we've seen the powerful results of unions, especially UBC. Construction has the lowest gender pay gap of any industry. The incredible women in this room are to thank for that. And I'm also proud that the bipartisan infrastructure law expands funding for workforce training including apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs and that local hiring goals will help boost hiring for underrepresented groups. But we need to go further to fight for more funding for apprenticeships. Hundreds of thousands of Americans across the country rely on registered apprenticeships every year for paid hands-on learning opportunities that have a pathway into the workforce. Investing and registered apprenticeship programs, benefits workers, its railings are economy and it helps employers build a pipeline of talented and dedicated workers. And this is key because as we work to rebuild and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have to be using every tool at our disposal to help workers find jobs and train them for these high quality jobs. And then we need strong enforcement for these protections. We need to make sure that your rights are protected and we need more funding for worker protection agencies like OSHA to address a glaring problem that jeopardizes the safety and health of every American worker. Right now at current funding levels, OSHA can inspect each workplace within its jurisdiction approximately once every 162 years. 162 years. So we have to do better to ensure that OSHA can actually serve workers and serve the American people. And we need to protect women against harassment in the workplace, reduce the gender pay gap and pass the pro-act to bolster workers rights to unionize. The pro-act will update organizing for the 21st century to protect workers against corporations that put profits before worker safety, fair pay and other basic benefits. The pandemic exposed a lot of harsh realities and one of them was the urgent need to protect and strengthen workers' rights and worker safety. Workers are essential to our economy, to our communities, to our country. And workers like you are not expendable. So one of the most important things I've learned throughout my career and especially in Congress is that finding good mentors is incredibly important. Throughout my career, I've relied on mentors and pro-tip mentors don't just have to be people who are older and more established than you. In fact, for me, some of my best mentors are my peers who are going through what I'm going through and know what it's like. In Congress, I've been so lucky to call Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the House of Mentor and Friend. And I know she's a great friend to the Carpenters too. Nancy Pelosi. Speaker Pelosi knows what it's like to make a name for yourself in the Old Boys Club and even as speaker of the House, she is still sometimes the only woman in the room. But she saw that by not only bringing more women into the room but giving them a seat at the head of the table. And there are so many members in the House I'm lucky to know and who support I rely on. And I hope all of you can find the same. Find a mentor who has been there before, who's blazed a trail or honestly who just gets it. And I know that sisters in the Brotherhood prioritize recruiting and mentoring with regional councils across the country. So take advantage of that. It's easy to feel alone. But the more of us who occupy the space, who hold positions of leadership, who talk about our lived experiences, the more we can help every other sister who wants to come next. And that's why I'm so grateful to each and every one of you for making this work easier for the next young woman who wants to work in the construction industry or join this union. You're making it easier for every young girl to realize that she can be a bad-ass pile driver or a mill worker or a lather or anything else. I mean I saw what you guys do yesterday. That is bad-ass. Some of you yesterday asked me if I have any advice for you. And honestly I think your job is harder than mine. So I don't know that I have any. But if I do, it's this. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't know enough or you're too young or you're too female to have an opinion or to make a difference. You are enough. Just the way you are. And we need you. We need your voice. We need your creativity. We need your opinions now more than ever. Because we are in the middle of a really, really difficult moment. It's dark. It's hard to feel hopeful sometimes. But I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful and I have faith. I have faith that women across the country and around the world are fed up. With having to choose between work and family, fed up with our rights being stripped away and we are going to fight back. We together are going to build the future that we deserve, build a government that looks like us, a job site where our talents and experiences are respected in a country and a world that is worthy of us. And we're going to do it together. So thank you all so much for everything that you do. Thank you for having me here today. It's such an honor to be doing this work alongside all of you. Thank you. Woo, you felt that? Come on. Give another round of applause.",

        "transcript": " Well, the race to represent California's 53rd Congressional District in the House of Representatives is one of several big races here in San Diego. Sarah Jacobs, who is running against City Council President George at Gomez joins us now to discuss her race and explain her government ethics policy plan. Good morning, Sarah. Good to see you. Good morning. We're on great to see you again. Okay, so why don't we start there? Your government ethics policy plan. Yeah, so there are three key parts to the plan. The first is eliminating conflicts of interest. So when I'm elected, I plan on putting all of my assets into a blind trust. And I think every member of Congress should be required to do so as well. The second piece is lobbying reform, banning members of Congress from becoming lobbyists, banning federal lobbyists from from contributing or bundling contributions to federal campaigns and expanding the definition of what lobbying is so that more people have to disclose the gifts that they're giving. And then lastly, to fix our very broken campaign finance system, including by a constitutional amendment to overturns and unite it. Well, you know, this idea of ethics and your policy plan is rather timely, especially looking at your race, which was getting heated between the two of you, both being Democrats and fighting for a lot of the same endorsements and votes. But recently you had a big endorsement from the Union Tribune after pointing out they reported after discussing with two independent tax attorneys that your opponent, George at Gomez, failed to report more than $100,000 in income on her taxes. Your thoughts on that. The next Congress is going to be making really important decisions about where federal recovery dollars are going as we're getting through this crisis that we're in. And I think it's incredibly important that we have leaders who sweat the details, who take responsibility and who are going to be able to do the hard work of bringing our country together through this crisis. Your opponent really pointed out that after there was this scrutiny that you should be releasing your tax returns, which you did showing significant income, mostly from capital gains. And you're actually voting in favor of some reform there. Yeah, look, I think I should be tax more and I think my family should be tax more. It's going to take all of us working together to get through this crisis and everyone needs to be paying their fair share. So I think we need to increase the capital gains tax. I think we need to close loopholes. And I think we need to bring the highest marginal tax rate up. And so when in looking at the significant economic impact that your district will be seeing in addition to really nationally what we're going to be experiencing, what what will be your priorities in order to help some of the most hardest hit industries. Yeah, I've been talking to folks across the district and people are really struggling. So my focus will be making sure that federal recovery gets to those who need it most, including our families and our small businesses. We know our small businesses need a lot more assistance. I think there was a study that showed that about 60% of small businesses in Chulavista are likely to close if we don't get more federal assistance. And I've been working on a small business plan with small business owners across the district and then making sure that the stimulus plan addresses our childcare constraints and is fixing the housing crisis that we were already in here in San Diego, but we know that this economic crisis has only made worse. All right. So we've got about three weeks to go. What will be your priorities moving forward? We're just trying to talk to as many voters as possible and focus on what I'm going to do when I get there to make their life a little bit better. All right. Sarah Jacobs candidate for the 53rd. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. Of course. Thanks for having me. Take care. All right. And just a reminder, Sarah Jacobs is running against a democratic current president of the San Diego City Council, Georgia Gomez for the seat being vacated by representative Susan Davis. A local nonprofit is",

        "transcript": " What's going on there, Mr. Baron? What's going on here is, is we have heard that the Trump allocated $300 million through the U.S. MCA agreement for infrastructure improvements in the United States of America, due to raw sewage and toxic chemical contamination coming in from Mexico, is now being diverted by the Biden administration back to studies. We got a list of who the stakeholders are in the Tijuana River Valley. We got wild coasts, we got surfrider. Now let me fill you in first about surfrider wild coast. We know that their plan, and I say it's their plan because sludge to Dena, that was his plan that he gave to surfrider for the Tijuana River Valley flood control plan. The EPA came out and said that plan is infeasible. So what do these guys do? These guys want to divert the Trump allocated money to studies. It has been overstudied in the Tijuana River Valley, not one more penny needs to be studied. It isn't rocket science folks, gravity is king. It's even your best friend or your worst enemy, and right now it's the worst enemy of the resident stakeholders who are the true bosses of people like worthless Juan Vargas, who is also on that list of stakeholders who they collaborate with to divert the funding, to studies, back to studies. This guy, this guy right here is not for the United States of America, he's not for the American people. This guy is pro sanctuary, which means he's in bed with the Mexican cartel to human traffic people into this country, which means he's into child trafficking, which means he's into human sex trafficking, child sex trafficking, drug trafficking, everything the Mexican cartel stands for. This man by sanctuary alone, if not everything else he does, is in bed with the Mexican cartel. He cares nothing about us. And it's the Biden administration that is diverting that funding back to studies and they're all in cahoots, the whole clown car dem fest of elected officials and politicians who claim they are leaders, they are leaders, we're the leaders, they're supposed to follow our lead. We are the people. These guys work for us. And what Mr. worthless Juan Vargas seems to forget is that he is in the legislative branch of the federal government, okay? That doesn't mean he's in the judiciary. That doesn't mean he's in the executive, he's in the legislative and he oversteeps his bounds. And he forgets that. Well, we're here with this rude awakening for worthless Juan Vargas and all the like of them to tell him what's going on that we, the people are the resident stakeholders. He works for us, we're his boss and we're ready to fire him.",

        "transcript": " Congresswoman Vargas, thank you for joining me today. President Obama has pledged to put everything into tighter gun control. He wants universal background checks on anyone trying to buy a gun. He wants to renew all of the assault weapons ban and a 10-round limit to magazines. What do you think of his proposal? And what are his chances of getting it passed? Well, I support him. I support him in each one of those things. I mean, we have to reduce the gun violence in this country. It's unbelievable the amount of violence that we have today. We can compare ourselves to some of these other democracies around the world. Obviously, we have just so much more violence than they do. So I think he has a good shot. Obviously, it'll be tough in some areas because people have believed that it's the second amendment right to have almost any type of weapon. In fact, some of the crazies have to call these guys crazy. Believe they can have nuclear weapons at home. That's for a malicious second amendment. So it'll be hard to negotiate with them. But I think that a lot of us love our kids. We have something wrong with you. And we want to reduce the violence. And we see it out there. So I'm very hopeful. We have some great testimony over in the Senate. Hope we have some opportunities in the Congress to reduce the violence. And I think some of these measures are good. I'd even go further. How would you go further? Well, I think ammunition is one of the things you really have to go. I mean, why don't you have background checks also for ammunition? They're going to do that in California. I think that would be important too. You know, a lot of these people, they may have a weapon, but they didn't have the ammunition. They couldn't go shoot people. So I'd go even further. OK, let's switch gears to immigration reform. It was a big week for the topic with both the Senate and the President putting forth their own proposals. Both plans offer a path to citizenship. But the Senate plan ties it to border security. How feasible is that? Well, I mean, it's a great first step. I mean, let's take it for what it is. Very positive. I mean, when you have everyone saying we have to take a look at all the people that are here undocumented and do something about it. And something that coincides with our history, which is compassion, love, family, and all these things. So it's a very positive first step. Now, there are differences, as you said, the issue of border security. And who's going to be on this commission? Who decides? I mean, is the governor of Arizona the one going to decide? You can't put it in her hands. She'll say there's never enough security. And then these poor people would be second-class citizens forever. They'd never have an opportunity to become a citizen of the US. So I think it's important that you have a process whereby you can become a citizen. And the president has proposed that, I think, in a better way than the Senate. But you know what? It's a great, great step forward. Expanding on the topic of border security, the Senate plan calls for adding more drones to patrol the border. As you know, drones are becoming an increasingly important part of San Diego's economy. And yet, the Department of Homeland Security's own inspector general says that the border drone program has serious management issues. How necessary do you think these drones are to patrol the border? Well, I have to tell you, it almost seems like a science fiction here with all the drones. I've been reading quite a bit about them. And I'm not really excited about the drones. I mean, I think they do have their place, but flying around the border here, I think it can actually do more damage than help. And I do think there's a real problem with them. So I'm not excited about it. I do think that they have their place in other confrontational areas and conflictive territories. But here at home, flying around the border where they can crash into homes and have all sorts of other problems. I'm not in favor of that. I don't think it helps. The House Republicans have agreed to extend the government's borrowing authority for another three months. That means that this debt-sealing fight is coming back at the end of March. Meanwhile, new figures show that the economy actually contracted in the last three months of last year. Can the United States afford this fight to come up every couple of months? No, I didn't vote for it. I thought it was ridiculous. I mean, one more gimmick, another three months down the road, we fight again. This only hurts our economy. I was one of the few people in Congress that voted against it. You can't create these crises. These crises really is what brings our economy down because you have to have confidence. Before we wrap up here, I want to touch on Santa No 3. As you know, Southern California Edison wants to reopen the plant at reduced capacity, 70 percent. Cities and the San Diego School District is calling for a trial-like hearing in which Edison is basically put on the stand and required to offer evidence that the plant is safe to reopen and cross-examined. What do you think about this? Well, I saw the Energy Constance Development Committee when I was in the assembly when the lights were going off in California. We actually put people under oath and found out what in the world went on. So it's not a bad idea as long as the right people are asking the question and it doesn't become a... Would you consider the right people? People who know what they're talking about. Instead of it becoming a road show and just politics, you know, get experts in there to ask them true questions. Is it really safe? You know, do you really have this under control? And if not why are you firing it up makes no sense. The only reason they want to do this is because they want to be able to get some money. And if it's vacant for a long time, they actually can't recoup their investment. So that's really the issue. One Vargas, thank you for coming on the program. It's a pleasure. Thank you for inviting me.",

        "transcript": " The chair recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Vargas, for five minutes. I think Mr. Speaker has been at his consent to address the House. Without objection. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of immigration reform, comprehensive immigration reform. I'd like to thank my colleague from Illinois that spoke earlier about his experience in saying that he believes in comprehensive immigration reform I do too. I just wish that when he was asked or when he asked the Board of Patrol agent, if there was one thing that you could bring back to Congress, one thing, what would it be? I wish that that gentleman would have said his Bible, because that's what he should have said. Bring your Bible. That will give you the best guidance. Bring your Bible. And I believe, Mr. Speaker, I'm allowed to read from the Bible. Is that correct? No one will come and tackle me. I'm new at this, my first year here, and I hope I'm not violating any law, but if I am, I'm going to do it anyway. And I would like to read from Matthew 25, because Matthew 25 speaks to the judgment, and I think it's very important for us to read this section, and even though my mom gave to me this Bible some time ago with giant print, I still need glasses now. And it reads like this, when the Son of Man comes in his glory, escorted by all the angels of heaven, he will sit upon his royal throne, and all the nations will be assembled before him. Then he will separate them into two groups as a shepherd-separate sheep from goats. The sheep he will place on his right hand, the goats on his left. The king will say to those on his right, come, you have my father's blessing, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world, for I was hungry, and you gave me food. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me. Who is the stranger? Who is the stranger among us that we welcome? I'll tell you who the stranger is among us who we welcome. The stranger is the wife of the soldier that we spoke to three weeks ago here in Washington. When he came and he testified and said, I'm not afraid of dying in Afghanistan, or I racked, I've been on three tours of duty. What I'm afraid is that my wife will get deported because she's undocumented, and then who will take care of my children? She is the stranger, the soldier's wife. Who is the stranger? Who is the stranger among us? Who is this least among us? I'll tell you who it is. It's the child and the parents who are here where the child is born here. He's an American citizen, but the parents weren't so the parents can get deported, and you break the family apart. And we deport the parents, and we don't know what happens to the children because they go to strangers. We break this family. Who's the stranger? Those parents, that child, and how we treat them is how we're going to be judged. And we have an opportunity here before us. And I'm very, very thankful now for the churches in this country. The Catholic Church for many years has been saying, we need humane, comprehensive immigration reform. They've said it loud and clear. And now the evangelical churches are out there saying the same thing. God bless them. And I know that they're praying. I know my parish is praying. We all open our hearts to this. And I have to tell you, I haven't been here long, but I do get the opportunity to pray with my colleagues on the Republican side. And they are great people with great hearts. And I hope that God speaks to them at this point in time and says, the stranger is the soldier's wife. The stranger is the child whose parents are going to be ripped away from. He is, in fact, the people that die crossing the border because they want a better life for themselves. Those are the strangers. And we're going to be judged. We're going to be judged on how we treat them. So we have an opportunity here. But also, step me apart from that people say, but it's illegal. What they've done is illegal. You know, the law is interesting. I happen to be a lawyer. And there's two ways to look at the law. There's the law that says it's mollum, per se. It's bad or evil in itself. Mollum per se in itself. Murder is mollum per se. It's always evil. It's always wrong to kill. On the other side, you have mollum prohibitum. What is mollum prohibitum? Mollum prohibitum means it's bad or wrong or illegal because we prohibit it. For example, if you drive 56 miles an hour in a 55 mile an hour zone, you've broken the law. Have you done anything illegal? Yes, you have. Have you done anything immoral? No. The road was built to go faster than that. Your car was. The brakes are good. You have violated the law. What do we often do? We change the law and we say 55 miles an hour doesn't make any sense. We change it to 60 or 65 or 70. I've been through Texas now. It's 75 there. California, we only have 70. Why because the law doesn't make any sense? Our immigration law doesn't make any sense. So yes, they've broken the law, but a law that doesn't make any sense. So let's change the law. Let's open our hearts. Let's take this Bible. Let's take a look and see what it says to us. And what it will say is this, that how we treat the stranger is how we are going to be judged as a nation. Mr. Speaker, thank you.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Mr. President. It's interesting when we talk about the voters and the voters' wills and what the voters want. I think John Adams was the one who said it that facts are stubborn things. So I took a look at a little bit of the facts in California. These are some facts. Back in 1902, this senate floor was populated with 34 Republicans and only six Democrats. The floor on the other side had and the assembly had 60 Republicans and only 20 Democrats. In 1912, interestingly, there were 28 Republicans and there were four Republican and Labor Union Party and eight Democrats. In the assembly, there were 69 Republicans and 11 Democrats. In 1932, on this floor, there were 35 Republicans, only four Democrats and there was a vacancy. In the assembly, there were 73 Republicans and only seven Democrats. Now we moved to more modern times. In 1972, there were only 19 Republicans and there were 21 Democrats in this house. In the other house, there were 36 Republicans, there were 43 Democrats and one vacancy. In 1992, there were 13 Republicans on this floor, 25 Democrats, one independent and one vacancy. In the other house, there were 32 Republicans and 48 Democrats. In 2002, after redistricting once again, there were 14 Republicans on this floor, 25 Democrats and one vacancy. In the assembly, there were 29 Republicans, there were 50 Democrats and one vacancy. So what do you see there? You see the voters speaking. What are opinions, whether we are the ones that carry out the voters' wills, that somehow, the voters are the ones that get to make the decisions? And it's very interesting how we've gone from 1902 from 34 Republicans on this floor to 15 and dwindling. And I do think that after the next election, the Republicans will be punished once again by the voters, because they don't listen to the people. Once again, the party will shrink and continue to shrink. Not my opinion, they're the stubborn facts. I remember spending six years in the assembly hearing over and over and over again how the public, the voters were going to punish the Democrats in the next election. The governor who was elected was a Democrat, lieutenant governor Democrat. You don't have to go down the list, you know every statewide constitutional officer, every one of them is now a Democrat, because the Republicans are not paying attention to the voters. Instead, you're paying attention to a very small but very vocal part of your party that says, net, net, net. It's time to change. It's time to look at what do the people want. I say this because remember the Wigs, remember the Federalist Party, parties that disappeared. Unless the Republicans in California start to understand the needs of the people, they're going to go the way of the Wigs, the way of the Federalist. They've shrunk and they're shrinking and they're going to disappear. Instead, everyone takes a look at the own interest in the very small districts as opposed to the corporate need of the state. I hope that changes. And this budget that we're going to pass today, I'm not happy about it. I'm not happy about it at all. It's not my vision. It's a very difficult budget. We do violence to the courts when we do these cuts. We especially do injustice to our children in the schools, to the poor and the elderly. But this is all we can do with a majority that's not a super majority. But that won't be for long because these numbers, these facts are stubborn. Not my opinion, their history, their facts. And I hope that in fact you start listening to the people. Allow them to vote on important issues like this. Allow them to do that. Otherwise, your numbers will continue to shrink. Thank you Mr. President.",

        "transcript": " He is one of the most recognized faces in local politics, spending his childhood in the 51st congressional district that he's now representing for almost a decade. Juan Vargas says there are a lot of things that have changed in San Diego since he was a kid. That includes the always growing number of Latinos in political office. I sat down with him during this Hispanic Heritage Month for a look back on his life and career. I think it's fantastic. When I first got elected, I basically was it. People always used to ask me to go on TV to speak Spanish because I was the only Spanish speaker when it was anything related to Latino heritage month or anything. It was me because there were no other people. That's changed dramatically. Juan Vargas was born in San Diego and grew up in National City. At a time it had a true small town vibe right down to the National City Fair. His neighborhood was mostly Latino. I grew up speaking Spanish in San Diego. My first language was Spanish. It wasn't even though I was born and raised here. Our little uncle, if everybody spoke Spanish. Vargas is one of ten children. His father came to the U.S. from Mexico as part of the Bracero program, working on a chicken ranch. I think I was probably thirteen and I was digging a ditch with my father working in planning trees and in landscape. He said, son, are you enjoying what you're doing? I said, no, dad, I'm not. And he goes, get an education. Is that? Yeah. No, that's what I want to do. Vargas may not have known he'd end up in Congress, but he did have an idea. He'd end up wearing a suit and tie to work after a chance meeting. My mom didn't know the law and she thought that they were going to lose their kids because of this accident. And we had a volunteer lawyer who was a Latino. They came and told us, ultimately, lady, you're a bad driver. You're not a bad mother. You're not going to lose your kids. And I looked up to him. I just thought, wow, it's the first Latino I had ever met in the United States with a Sudan. I'd never met one with a Sudan. And also, he kind of became the image of who I wanted to be. You can be anything you want in this country, in this country, even though you're poor, you can do anything you want. He graduated from the University of San Diego in 1983 at this ceremony. He'd add a master's from Fordham and then a law degree from Harvard. Juan Vargas first took office on the San Diego City Council in 1993. He was the only Latino on the council at the time. That was the first time he sat down with CBS 8 for a Hispanic Heritage Month story. There were times, certainly, when I was growing up that I felt I had to prove myself. Had to work a little harder, had some questioning about my abilities because I was a Latino. Vargas moved to State Assembly in 2000, State Senate in 2010, and Congress representing the 51st District since 2013. He is proud of his record and representation. I never did anything that I'm ashamed of just the opposite. I think I've behaved myself well and comported myself in a way that is appropriate. And so I feel good about that. Feel good about where my community is here in San Diego. Hispanic Heritage Month has become a big celebration. And for Vargas, it's a chance to appreciate progress. I think the biggest thing, at least for me, about Hispanic Heritage Month is that you can be proud of who you are as a Latino. Growing up, as I did, people would call you names and lots of other things that were very negative. They don't do that anymore. People are respectful, but they're proud of the diversity. And that's what I would tell them. I mean, I think we've come a long way in this community. I think we've come a long way in this country to accept people as they are. They're backgrounds. And I think that's a fabulous thing. Do you have any special memories about Hispanic Heritage Month? Now, when you're growing up, it was a week. And then, well, into your adulthood, it became Hispanic Heritage Month. What are your memories about it? It is interesting going to Old Town. It was kind of a treat for us. Old Town was kind of expensive for a family like us to go to. But it was always a nice place. So we go to Old Town. We go to one of those Mexican restaurants. My mom and dad really enjoyed it. And before it was us, Latino celebrating this now, it's like everyone celebrating something. It's fun. I think it really has transcended just the Latino community. I think maybe Corona did that because of all the advertising who knows. But it is funny because I think that now it's something that's pretty universal to everybody. So, whether driven by advertising or integration, Hispanic Heritage is celebrated by so many in San Diego in so many ways. And Vargas is proud to be a part of that and of a growing melting pot. And that's one of the things I love about San Diego. We do try hard. I mean, we do try to integrate everyone in our community. We do try to get along. I think we do. I think we have a very rich culture. Not only Latinos, but Irish, Italians, African Americans, of course, Filipinos. And I think that makes it a wonderful community. Congressman Vargas says his parents are very supportive. He had an uncle who kind of discouraged him for pursuing his career and his education and his dreams. And his parents said, no, it's America. You can be anything you want to be. And he did. He became that. He is the American dream. You were saying it during the story. I love, you know what I love, all the old footage through the years at CBS 8 has covered everywhere. He's back. One of the things we have, we have a long institutional memory. I have to thank Barbara Neilson. She's our archives editor. She helped me dig through. We had to go through a lot of stuff to find some of those older images. And I also want to thank Colleen Murphy who edited that. But we have this bank that we like to reach into it and make some withdrawals on once in a while. And it was fun doing it. It was fun to look at it. It's incredible. Wow, the history.",

        "transcript": " Hi everybody! Are you fired up? I'm Diana DeGaette, Rosa Deloros on her way. Louise Slider, my co-chair of the Pro Choice Caucus, is on our way. And we are in a fighting mood. I hope you're in a fighting mood because we've got a fight on our hands in case you haven't noticed. And what the fight we have is the perennial fight for women's health. We cannot let this 112th Congress take away our rights to health care. Do you agree? So every... I mean you might have heard that we have 9% unemployment in this country. But you know, apparently this is not the agenda of the new leadership in Congress. Apparently the agenda of the new leadership of Congress is to systematically take away women's health. And you know this and we are not going to let it happen. The very first bill that passed was a bill to defund the health care bill, which gave so many health care services to women and eliminated discrimination and health care plans on the basis of gender. We think that's wrong and we're going to fight to make sure that that doesn't happen. The second thing they did in my committee, they passed a bill that said you can't buy an insurance policy and get a tax credit if you offer full reproductive services. We're not going to let that happen either. You might have heard, you might have heard as well as if you have a hard right social issues that the thing that's holding up the budget negotiations right now is their desire to deny women in the district of Columbia the right to full reproductive services. And we're not going to let that happen either. It don't make no mistake about it. There is a systematic assault on women's health care, health care, prevention, birth control, full reproductive rights, and it is happening right now, right down the hill, and there's only one way to stop it because we don't have a pro-choice majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. So the first thing is, next election cycle, will you please help me fix that? The second thing is, we need to call them out on this. We need to say to them, you know, it's not just about abortion, although abortion rights are important. It's about birth control. It's about preventing unwanted pregnancies. It's about cancer screenings. It's about women's health care. And you can't take your right wing assault on women, and we're not going to allow it to happen. I'm so glad that you're here supporting me and the pro-choice caucus, which is by the way 170 strong in the House. I'm so glad you're here supporting each other. But what I really need you to do is march down the street right here, and tell every member of Congress, House and Senate, Democrat and Republican, man and woman, we are not going to stand for it, we're going to fight for women's health, and we're going to fight till we win. Thank you very much.",

        "transcript": " You know, this is a really important rally, but you don't need to me to tell you that. The banners that we see, the diversity of citizens and dreamers that we see here today, we all say the message. And the message is this. Our city has a long history of welcoming immigrants from around the world with open arms and we are not about to stop now. This is a history that we are so proud of. Most of the immigrants who live in Denver have lived here most of their lives. There are friends in our neighbors, there are kids, teachers and their coaches. They are valuable members of our communities and none of them, none of them, ever, deserve to have to spend their lives worrying about if someone is going to take them and deport them to another country. Especially our dreamers. As we just heard from Alejandro, our dreamers are special. Most of them came here at a very young age. They grew up here. They went to school here. They helped our community grow in countless ways. We have more than 800,000 dreamers across our country, including thousands who are right here in the Denver area. And you know what? Each one of those dreamers deserves the best we can give them in this community and this country. I want to tell you, instead of providing them simple protection, we should be providing them a path to citizenship. Instead of forcing them to live in fear, we should be helping our dreamers to succeed. Instead of ripping their families apart, we should be helping them bring their families together because that's what we do here in America. Now I want to talk about Maria who came here to the U.S. at the age of five. She graduated from CU Denver and now she's studying to be a doctor or Marco who went, who went to Glowville at the age of three and went on to study at CU Boulder where he was elected student body president. Or Marissa who came here at the age of nine, grew up in Glenwood Springs, graduated from Fort Lewis College and went on to teach Spanish here in the Denver area. These kids are not a threat to our nation. These kids are our nation. We better realize that. I'm here for two reasons. Number one, to tell this Supreme Court to do the right thing and to uphold DACA. But beyond that, I'm here to say it's been nearly six months since the U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation to protect these kids and provide them the path to citizenship, the DREAM Act. And Congressman Crow, who's standing here, Congressman Neguse and Congressman ProMutter, we all voted for and co-sponsored the DREAM Act and we are so proud of that. But, like I said, it's been six months. We need to pass the DREAM Act in the Senate. We need to put it on President Trump's desk. So it's two things we need to do. And with the lives of hundreds of thousands of kids now hanging in the balance, the Senate's refusal to act on this bill cannot be tolerated anymore. Now's the time to have our collective voices heard. We need to demand that the Senate do what's right and we need to let the Supreme Court and the Senate know we are not going to stop until this is done. So that's going to march. I want to thank you, Mayor, again for having this wonderful event. And I want to thank my wonderful hometown and my community for caring about what happens to every single person who lives here. It means a lot. So thanks everybody. Let's get going.",

already okay let me ask this how many of you because I said so are gonna go home and vote this afternoon how many of you are going to spend an hour two hours 10 hours 20 hours over the next 12 days getting every single person in Colorado to go and exercise now let me start out by thanking you for everything you've done and everything that you will do not just for Mark you know but for all of our wonderful candidates that we have in Colorado I don't need to tell you there is so much at stake in this election and whether it's knocking on doors making phone calls or stuffing out the lobes your help truly makes the difference here's the here's the thing that's new this year in Colorado we have all male voting do you know what that and that's M.A. I.L. but you know what that means that means we don't have to get everybody to get their ballot in just on one day that means we have 12 days my friends 12 days to get every ballot in can we do that you can't tell I'm a little fired up this election here I think you are two or you fire not two reason I'm fired up it's not just because Mark you know it's been such a great friend and senator for us but also because progress on the issues that we care about is so much at stake in this election Colorado spent a national leader in making sure that every single woman can access the health care services we need I can tell you nobody's done more for women than Mark Udaw has and we're seeing the results right here in this state was lower-team pregnancy and abortion rates our opponents not only want to ban abortion they want to cut funding for plan parenthood to stop moving for getting the health care they need and thank you LaGrieve that approach is wrong and that approach is on the balance right now Mark and I worked together to reform health insurance so that just being a woman was no longer a pre-existing condition I can tell you some personal experience Mark's opponent has voted over 50 times to repeal the affordable care act that's just right and that's on the ballot right now Mark spent a champion for our environment our clean air and water and Colorado's wildlife but the Koch brothers and their allies are trying to undo all of this this agenda hurts Colorado and guess what it's on the ballot right now Mark is a true friend and ally of the LGBT community I think we should celebrate the fact that every loving couple in this state can decide to marry some of you might know I'm a minister now I got my credentials online and I'm just waiting I did and I did a lot of commitment ceremonies now I'm going to perform some marriage the debate over marriage rights is not over yet and this issue is on the ballot right now Mark Rudolph has always been an unwavering supporter of a woman's right to choose and her rights to reproductive health care services but you can what you can clap for Mark's opponent has sponsored a federal personhood amendment which like a amendment 67 would ban abortion it would ban many forms of birth control it would ban in re-controfertalization and it would probably ban embryonic stem cell research well guess what we beat this personhood amendment here in Colorado not once but twice and we're gonna do it again let's make sure that we tell the world Colorado will not elect someone who supports this radical proposal to the US Senate this is on the ballot this year now Mark Rudolph has brought our state the kind of steady leadership and skill we need in our leaders and from every corner of the state we are grateful for this I'm grateful for this because I surf with him every day and so what we need to do as Maya said we need to get together every hour every day we've got 12 days and on we the ballots are already out all of you already have your ballots if you don't have your ballots make sure you get one before election day because this election matters it matters for ourselves it matters for our parents it matters for our kids and so it's up to everybody here to do one more campus one more phone bag shift and get a few more friends to vote and I don't think you need to take that just for me I think you need to hear from somebody who's on the ground over in the Senate every day with Mark fighting hard for Colorado families fighting to make sure all of these things are preserved and that Senator Michael Bennett please Isn't it great to have the first lady here you know why she's here because this race is very very close and the entire Senate could come down to Colorado and we didn't make sure that that we've reelected Mark Utah and hold this majority in the United States Senate I don't know if you ever watch the cable TV if you do you probably should turn it off in fact probably should just turn your TV off altogether but if you do watch that you hear these guys at the other side when they're out here campaigning or in Washington they're always saying they want to take the country back have you heard them say that they never say where they want to take it back although it's some century centuries ago they don't say from whom they want to take it back and it's so mad you think that we're losing jobs in 800,000 jobs a month you think that our auto industry was about to slide into bankruptcy you think that all of our bags had closed and that that our savings and our pensions and our 401k's were half the value that they once were but that is not the situation today that was a situation when Mark Utah first went to Washington that's not the situation today we have had 55 months of job growth in this country we have created 10 million private sector jobs in this country 200,000 right here in Colorado where unemployment rate is not 9% it is 4.7% and that hasn't happened by accident and the reason we're all here all of us are here is that we're not satisfied with that yet we don't want to go back to where we were but we want to go forward to an economy that works for everybody who works hard in Colorado and across this country we want to go forward to an increase in the minimum wage forward to an increase to equal pay for equal work no matter who you are that's what we got to send them back but it's close it is so close that this is what I know if we do what we're supposed to do if we do what we know how to do if we do what we did in 2010 when every single public poll said I could not win the race we won't win the race it's not a question of it it's a question of when and that is between now and November 4th everybody in here is more hard everybody in here has signed up I want you to please sign up again for another ship please make more phone call I'm doing it Susan's doing it Tuesday and parkville last night making calls to the headquarters there but I want to just leave you with one thought the only way we're gonna win this race is if we get everybody out to vote so we enjoy me and say it we're gonna win this race because we're gonna vote vote vote vote vote م CHEERING AND APPLAUSE",

I'm going to come from CC at 1979 and I'm always happy to come back to campus. I want to thank some folks. First of all I want to thank the Colorado College and Democrat. Let's give them a big hand over to my students. Second of all I want to thank the Carnivore Club who are over there grilling in this hot hot by their giving you some food. Thank you for your time. So you all know that my friend, St. Cinnator John Worson, is being recalled over his courageous leadership in the Colorado legislature. On making sure that we've passed responsible gun safety legislation in Colorado. I'm so proud of him but you might ask me, what on earth Diana are you doing in Colorado Springs on a Friday morning when your congressional district is Denver? And I will tell you why. This recal election is of national importance. Every eye in the country is looking at Colorado Springs and most particularly at this campus right now. And the reason is because this is the first time this has ever happened that state legislators who had encouraged to stand up for what's right, to stand up for safety and to stand up for our families. This is the first time ever that legislators like this have been recalled for their leadership and we will not let that happen. Well we. Now I'm going to turn the microphone over to Senator Morse who has been working nonstop not just to protect his job but to protect the values for which we all stand. And I'm so proud of you, John. I really am. You're just doing a great job. But the voting has started. The voting ends next Tuesday and every vote counts. I don't think there's anyone here who wants to wake up Wednesday morning and see that we lost this battle by three or five or twenty votes. It could happen. And so everybody here needs to do their part. How can you help? Well number one, if you're already registered to vote here in Colorado Springs from the 2012 election, you can go down and vote. You'll hear exactly word of vote in a minute. If you are not registered to vote in Colorado Springs and you have lived in Colorado Springs more than 22 days, you are a resident of Colorado Springs. What happens here matters to you as a Colorado Springs resident and you are eligible to register on the spot to vote in this election. Colorado College students can and will make the difference in this election. And so you might have seen students can't be seen throughout the campus asking you, please stand up for democracy. Stand up for representative government. Stand up for responsible gun safety and go and vote. You can go today. They can go tomorrow. They can go tomorrow. They can go Monday and they can go Tuesday to vote. It's not very far away. Fans are standing by or you can walk and take your bite. So I want to ask you how many of you pledge to me, Colorado College Tiger, that you will go and vote. Colorado College not going to give you guys a camera for a resolution raise your hands. But don't raise your hand if you are not eligible to vote. If you can help us do that, we can win this. We can preserve our democracy. And I want to thank you so much. I now want to turn this microphone over to my friend, State Senator John Morris, who is a fighter for justice.",

And then and then Tuesday, two days ago in Congress, we passed a bill to basically vastly expand restrictions on funding for insurance programs that people pay for with their own money that might provide abortions. And so we think our work's going to come out, be cut out for us. The next thing we think will happen is they'll try to defund plan parenthood again. And of course, plan parenthood provides wellness services, cervical and breast cancer screening, birth control and family planning to millions of American women. So this is going to be a big big fight. And I know these are issues that are that are near and dear to your heart. So what's the strategy going forward and trying to preserve what what you have built to this point? Well, I think what needs to happen is is American citizens need to call their members of Congress and they need to tell them how important family planning is to them and and plan parenthood and so on. I was at the women's march in Washington, DC. There were over 500,000 people there. And I heard there were almost 200,000 people here in Denver. So women really are watching this. They really are concerned about things like family planning and and and so people just need to raise their voices and let their members of Congress know they care. And what are your thoughts as we talk about and there's a lot of talk about repealing Obamacare? Well, I think that the Affordable Care Act has given insurance to over 20 million more Americans and it's brought the cost of insurance down and it's given people with pre-existing conditions and high annual or lifetime cost of insurance hoped that they can be insured. It's really done wonderful things. If you repealed it then the Congressional Budget Office believes that over 20 million people would lose their insurance and we just can't go back to that. I had a listening session last night and I had 200 people show up at this listening session. People were telling heartbreaking stories about how they couldn't get insurance before. Now they have insurance and how if they lost it how it would devastate their families and their health. Is the idea of a blockgrantee feasible? A block grant in Washington is just a code name for funding cuts. And if you tried to, for example, the Republicans have said that they might want a block grant Medicaid to the states what that would mean would be less money for states. States like Colorado would then have to reach into their state budgets to have to pay for health care for poor people. While some states I'm sure Colorado would do this, the surrounding states might not. So many, many more low income people would flood into our state and take advantage of our system and also because of our state constitution and our budgeting the taper amendment I don't know how we would pay for all of this. So it's not feasible in your mind. It's not feasible. Do you see anything within this administration with all of the changes that have been put out there that are salvageable in your mind as to how we can move forward? Well you know I passed a really big bill at the very end of the last Congress 21st century cures and it was restructuring the way we do biomedical research in this country. It was a 100% bipartisan bill. We passed it in the Senate House with bipartisan majorities and I've been talking to my Republican friends about the Affordable Care Act and I said we could use that as a model for how we work on this instead of just ramming through a repeal of the ACA without having a replacement in place and jeopardizing the health care of millions of Americans. Why don't we actually sit down together and try to figure out how we can fix the ACA together. I have some ideas. There are some things that need to be fixed and I think we could do that. But apparently President Trump and the Republican majority in Congress they just seem hell banned on repealing the ACA and putting so many millions of Americans at risk.",

        "transcript": " Hello, I'm Congresswoman Diana Dugette from Colorado. As a senior member of the House Committee with jurisdiction over health care policy, I've played a leading role in the development of comprehensive health reform in this country. I helped shepherd the Affordable Care Act into law eight years ago, and since then, I've proudly been at the forefront of the fight to defend American's health care from the many badly misguided Republican efforts to repeal the law and the historic protections it provides. After the ACA passed, finally forbidding insurers from discriminating against or denying coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions, the GOP spent eight years crusading to repeal the law, even forcing a government shutdown at one point to make their case. Last year, after 217 House Republicans voted for their terrible repeal bill to take away Americans' health care, the effort failed by just one vote in the Senate. Had Republicans succeeded, they would have devastated health care coverage in this country. Millions of Americans would have lost their coverage or been forced to pay more for it. Under Americans would have faced what the AARP called an age tax, meaning they could be charged up to five times as much for coverage as younger ones. And protections for the 130 million people with pre-existing conditions would have been gutted. After failing in the Congress, Republicans turned to the court with a cruel lawsuit to strike down protections for pre-existing conditions. And the Republican leadership in Congress continues to introduce other bills that still would undermine the ability of the millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions to get affordable and comprehensive health insurance. In August, Republican Senators introduced a bill with a big loophole for health insurance companies that essentially would let them exclude pre-existing conditions from coverage. Our bill would allow insurers to charge those with costlier health conditions much more for their insurance, making health coverage unaffordable for families with loved ones with pre-existing conditions across America. House members soon followed suit with a similar bill. But even after voting to destroy protections for pre-existing conditions and pushing new legislative and legal assaults, Republicans are now falsely claiming that they are taking steps to preserve these protections. It's ironic that Republicans have said they support keeping pre-existing condition protections while continuing their relentless assault on American's health care. Worse yet, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell admitted that if his party has the votes in Congress next year, they'll try again to repeal the ACA altogether. And President Trump said the same thing last month. Democrats have a different agenda for Congress, a Congress that works for the people instead of a Congress obsessed with destroying American's health care. We want to lower health care costs and the price of prescription drugs. We want to raise wages and drive strong economic growth by rebuilding America. And we want to clean up corruption to make Washington work for you. Rather than attacking the health care of Americans with pre-existing conditions, I urge my Republican colleagues to actually work across the aisle to strengthen America's health care system. Republicans should work with Democrats on bipartisan improvements that would reduce premiums and deductibles, increase price transparency, and access to care providing relief from high drug prices. The public expects no less. Thank you.",

My sisters and I were encouraged to choose the direction of our lives. We became a congresswoman, a stand-home mom, a filmmaker and a journalist, and Lena and I taught our children that they could rise to even greater heights. They could become surgeons, CEOs, Supreme Court justices, Secretary of State, and even President of the United States. We didn't teach our daughters that they were second-class citizens. With proposal after proposal, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to make women second-class citizens again. We will not let that happen. As a fourth generation, Colorado, I believe that our Western spirit is an inspiration for what makes America great. Our learner stands strong in our defensive individual rights and women's equality. Colorado will celebrate its 120th anniversary of granting women the right to vote, the very first state in the nation to do so. The achievements we've achieved did not come easily. Many oppose the advance of women into new roles and responsibilities. They even oppose our right to vote. But working together, we have established our rightful place in our American Republic. Even today though, there are still many battles to be won. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan would have us fighting to defend old gains all over again. More and more in this economy, the women are the family breadwinners. We are managing our family budgets, struggling to pay health care bills, and facing the challenge of saving for college. We feel it in our paychecks when we receive only $0.77 for every dollar a man earns. President Obama understands how unfair this is. That's why the very first bill he signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Act to strengthen a woman's right to demand equal pay for doing the exact same job. But look what the Romney Ryan ticket would do. Cut PAL grants which make college affordable. Repeal the Affordable Care Act that finally prohibits discrimination by insurance companies when they charge women more than men for health insurance. The Romney Ryan ticket promises to slash plan parenthood funding that helps women get affordable cancer screening and family planning services. Romney and Ryan support the so-called personhood amendment that would ban many forms of birth control, would ban all abortions even in the cases of rape, incest, or to save a mother's life. Ban in vitro fertilization which helps families have children of their own. And it would even ban embryonic stem cell research which holds the promise to cure so many diseases. But although these restrictions on women's rights are all Republican ideas and even in their platform, my friends across the aisle now try to change the subject. It's the economy they cry and you know what? They're right. When they break the guarantee of Medicare, it will hurt women and families right in the pocketbook. When they allow insurance companies to deny coverage, they solely on the pre-existing condition of being a woman. It hurts women and families right in the pocketbook. When they take away the guarantee of coverage for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings in the Affordable Care Act, it will hurt women and families right in the pocketbook. And when they deny women access to birth control so that we can plan to have our children, it hits women and families right in the pocketbook. Reproductive freedom means economic freedom. And that's what this debate is all about. In short, the Romney Ryan ticket would reverse more than a century of hard fought progress for women. Mr. Romney, Mr. Ryan, the women of America have a message for you. We're not going back. We're going forward. Forward with the President who understands and dispends the rights and interests of America women. Forward with the President who believes in economic opportunity, equal pay for equal work. Forward with our President Barack Obama. Forward with our President Barack Obama.",

        "transcript": " Thanks, Mark. Thanks so much for joining us. Tell us what you've seen and what you think the American people need to know about. Bob, what the American people need to know is this is absolutely a humanitarian crisis. This is taking place here at our southern border. And it's because of the Biden regime and their policies that have planned this, encouraged it and incentivized it. There's no end in sight. I have spoke with Border Patrol agents. They want to return to the Trump era policies. Because for four years, things were getting increasingly better here at the southern border because we were actually securing our southern border and we were funding our Border Patrol agents. Now, there has been no added funding. They have been stripped of mechanisms that actually work like like arrow-dart balloons and even cameras at drop bridges. There's no funding for this, so they're wanting to remove them. And we have hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens crossing our southern border. Border Patrol agents are completely overwhelmed even though they had a plan to take in these folks that are coming across the border. But then they got punched in the face. It's really hard to stay positive and do your job when you don't have the funding and you're completely overrun. I was down at the Donut Detention Facility just yesterday and I saw moms carrying their children swaddled in mylar blankets. We have a border czar who has not been here for 70 days. She has not made a single appearance here at the southern border. She needs to look these children in the eyes, look their mothers in the eyes and tell them that there are their policies that are encouraging this behavior. Yeah, so Vice President Harris hasn't been there. President Biden hasn't been there. Congresswoman Bobard, I was looking at some of the social media posts that you've made since you made the trip down there and one of them in particular struck me. I'm not sure if you shot it or not, but it was video of a bus that was taking these illegal immigrants and transporting them free of charge further into the country to cities all across the United States. Heather, this is what we were greeted with. A bus full of illegal migrant children being transported all throughout our country. There are currently hotels that have no big contracts with the government that are housing these aliens in their facilities. And the taxpayers are paying for it every 15 minutes. This bus picks up another load of children and takes them to facilities. There's other folks that are getting on this bus as well. HHS agents actually tried to kind of hide what was going on and even say that it was staff that are being bused into the facility that are parked outside of the facility. But that's not true. We saw children being put in staff shirts and loaded onto the vans onto these big huge buses and then being taken off the grounds. It was kind of like a shell game when walking through the HHS facility. They didn't want us to take photos in there. They didn't want us to take videos. I was able to capture some footage of what takes place. And one of the things that was most interesting was the classrooms, the in-person learning that has taken place, that these children, these boys who are in this HHS facility, ages 13 to 17, each have one staff member assigned to them. The ratios are incredible. When we don't have in-person learning in American schools, they have smart boards, they all have laptop computers. And they're learning basic math skills, not even common core or critical race theory, like our schools are teaching our children. We're getting a real education here at the border. Yeah, Congressman, who are you down there with? And when you talk to border patrol, what do they tell you? I'm down here with Congressman Michael Cloud and Congressman Byron Donalds. And we're listening to the agents and every person that we have come into contact with says that they want to return back to these Trump era policies because the Biden policies are not working and they're overwhelmed. The thing that they're most concerned about is Title 42 being pulled. They know that this is going to happen. Title 42 allows them to turn away single adults and send them back to Mexico. But once this Title 42 is pulled, we're going to see 1800 illegal aliens per day coming into our country and we're keeping them here. And we're distributing them all across our nation. We're busing them. We are housing them. We're putting them on airplanes and sending them all throughout our country. They're not going back to Central America. They're not going back to Mexico. They're not going back to China. They are staying right here in our country. And that's what's most alarming to the border patrol agents that we are speaking with. They've seen an increase, of course, of human smuggling, drug smuggling, gun smuggling. And they say that it's only getting worse. Maybe the facilities are less occupied, but that's just because they're being shipped all throughout the country. It doesn't mean that the crisis is ending or lessening. So what do they need? They need support from us. They need funding, first of all, and they need a secure border. In Macalant, Texas, I was down here in the Rio Grande Valley and they were promised a certain amount of border wall. And they still have 89 miles to go. But construction is halted under the Biden regime and those policies under that executive order that he signed on day one. There is no more construction of the border wall and they need those 89 miles. So they can be in control of their border. One agent can patrol a secure border. But when it's unsecured, they need at least five agents. They don't have the manpower. They don't have the funding and they don't have the wall. Well, Congressman Bober, thank you so much for joining us. We hope you stay safe down there and keep informing people as far as what's going on. And we appreciate you doing it with us. Thank you very much.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Sherith. Wow, Eagle County. This is incredible. Thank you so much for having me here today. Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Pamela. Thank you all for your service, your sacrifice, and making this possible. Sherith, that was a beautiful introduction. And I hope to make you proud, just like you were making each and every person here proud, serving your county. Thank you. We even had the patriots of Pueblo County show up today. Eagle County, you drew it a crowd. This is incredible. You know yesterday was a day of remembrance, a pivotal moment in our country where we weren't talking about kneeling for the flag. We weren't talking about win and when you shouldn't stand, but it was a moment where America stood together in unity. And I was reflecting on that, and I was just thinking of the patriotism that came from that. We all suffered together, and at the same time we all grabbed onto each other and said, we are going to come out of this stronger than ever. We are going to come out of this together. The Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist that day. That was a powerful moment of unity. Just a few years later, on September 11th, we had four soldiers who were serving, continuing to serve in Benghazi. They lost their lives there, and we have four of them still telling that story of their sacrifice, how they had missiles coming their way, and they would do everything that they could to defend America, while they were waiting on help, while they could defend those that are around them. And I heard one of those brave men, Mark Geist, they call him Oz. He said, there were six of us on the rooftop, but as I saw missiles coming our way, and take a 90 degree turn, I knew that there was a seventh man there that night. Jesus, the Lord God Almighty, was there, protecting them. And he's here with us today. God is doing something great in our country. He is moving all throughout our country, and I want you to know that it is tangible. We travel, and we meet with people just like you. And I want you to know everything that you do, every call that you make, every conversation that you have with someone, every time you speak up about how important this voting cycle is going to be. You're not just doing it for your neighbors or your community, your state or your country. You are sowing into the very kingdom of God, and we are going to reap a harvest. Like no one has ever seen before. Your services, your sacrifices, they are not in vain. We've all reached a point where we're fed up with politicians. They go to DC, they forget who they work for. They over-regulate, over-tax, over-spend, and ultimately destroy everything that we are building here at home. I got involved because I saw people on the left who want to take everything from us. They want to make our lives difficult and complex, and they want us to put our trust in them. While they take our liberties, our freedom, our rights, as a virus has shown us, they want to take away small businesses, the lifeline of our country, the heartbeat of America. They want to tell you where you can shop when you can shop there, at what time of day, how old you have to be at that time to be there, and certain what you have to wear. It's not the proper role of government. The role of government is to inform us of the risk, and then let us decide. Let us choose what we're going to choose. For instance, I know darn well. I've been told my whole life, the risks of eating raw cookie dough. I never want government to come in and tell me what I could do with my cookie dough. That is not the proper role. I know the risk, and I'll take it. This has gone so far, and there are so many people who the left is losing. They're losing their own. They're losing the center, because they see the lawlessness, the chaos, and the destruction that's coming from their party. When their platform is defunding, dismantling, disbanding, our police officers, that's on American, and that's not something that we will tolerate. That's not something that we will stand for. We stand for our law enforcement officers. We pray for them. We put their lives on the line for us each and every day. There are a lot of people who've never known how limiting it is to depend on government. But they're starting to see it now when government has just too much control. We, the governed, we the people, we give consent to be governed. And there are some things that we're not putting up with anymore. Government has power because of us. Their power is derived from we the people, and we the people we don't get our rights from government. We don't even get it from the Constitution. We get our rights from God Almighty. Yes. I know firsthand what it's like to depend on government. It's not the American dream. My mom believed the lies that she was told. She believed the only way to successfully take care of her five children was through government assistance. I know what it's like to depend on government for food and housing and health care. I know that my mom made sacrifices that she wouldn't have to if she had somebody telling her you can do it. She suppressed gifts and talents that are on the inside of her for her children because someone told her this is how you do it. And we were limited. We were stuck in a cycle of poverty with no incentive to ever get out. We've stood in those lines for bread and cheese. When we moved from a rough area in Denver to the western soap of Colorado, it was the best thing that could have ever happened to us. We started to experience community like never before. For the first time in our lives, we had neighbors that said hello. I got my first job at the rifle McDonald's. I'm so grateful for the owners of that establishment who invested in me. As a young teenager with no skills, hardly any availability, not knowing the outcome of their investment, they took a risk and hired me. And I developed a job skill. I developed work ethics. And I still remember bringing mom home that first check. That paycheck had pride connected to it. Empowerment. I began to develop personal responsibility. And I saw from a very young age that I could do a better job taking care of myself than government ever could. Thank you. My mom's here today. And I want you to know she is my best friend. She is my hero. She is everything that I've always wanted to be. That might be why I have four boys because after me she had four boys. I love my mom so much. And she later learned that she could put her hand to something and be successful. My mom became a business owner and ran a successful business in the influence of community. Yay, mom. I love you. I took that same grit and determination, that freedom, that personal responsibility, that independent living, to women at the Garfield County Jail. And for seven years I counseled at risk women. These women were at the lowest points in their life. Most had lost hope for a prosperous future, for a powerful future. But I was able to bring them hope. And not just any hope, but a favorable, confident expectation that they didn't have to live bound by their past mistakes. But if they allowed God to get in the middle of that, he could restore whatever their past looked like for a glorious and impactful future. As a business owner, I now know what it's like to take risks on people. And I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to do that. I know when times get tough, you don't quit. You get tougher. When we opened our restaurant in Rifle, Colorado, we were just a Western themed restaurant. We wanted to give back to our community. Those women that I counseled in the jail, I had an opportunity to bring them into my home and live with my family. And now through my business, I was able to offer them jobs, create opportunities for them to put their hand to something, and be in charge of their future. Shortly after we opened our restaurant, there was an altercation where a man was brutally beat to death outside my restaurant. It immediately prompted the question of me, how will I defend my people? How will I protect those around me? That's when I took advantage of Colorado's open carry laws. You did it! I began to open carry in my restaurant, and shortly after that, my waitresses began to carry. And then the next thing you know, Nightline 2020 was in our store calling Shooters Grill, the safest restaurant in America. Certainly Shooters Grill has given me a platform for the second amendment, but through that, an advocacy for freedom was born. I began to breed and study the Constitution, and I fell in love with it. I fell in love with a vision. Our founding fathers were divinely inspired to have for our country. I saw how far away we were drifting from that. As a mom of four boys, I want them to live the American dream. I want them to have every opportunity, and more than I had. That's what we all want for these children that are coming up. And I'm sure that you are all feeling the same pressure that I feel as a mom. I feel that there is a mandate on my life to secure the nation. I'm sending my boys out too, and I refuse to send them into AOC's social estimation. This is me stepping up to do my part to serve my country, to protect freedom for generations to come. President Ronald Reagan said that freedom is never more than one generation away from being extinct. That's what we're at right now. I want the American dream to remain. I want to be strong and alive for generations to come. America is an exceptional country because we secure the rights of the individual. Not a group or a class or a race. The individual is the most vulnerable in our nation, and that's what makes us the greatest nation this world has ever known. In America, you can do anything. There are no limits. I went from standing in line for government cheese to receiving an invitation from the White House to watch the President of the United States give me something. This is the America that I know and love. This is the America that I want to secure for generations to come. We are seeing how important this election is. We always hear this is the most important election of our lifetime. No matter how many times someone said it about the election previous, this could be the last most important election that we ever have. Joe Biden has said that he wants to fundamentally transform America. The last person to say that was former President Barack Obama. We have to stop that agenda and stand for righteousness. Freedom is on the ballot. America is on the ballot. What I stepped up to run, I had no idea that we would have the support that we have. But you all showed us on the June 30th primary that you're through with DC politics as usual. We won that primary by nearly 10 points. I have folks telling me you need to stop talking about that primary. Absolutely not. This is your victory and I'm not taking that from you. We won by nearly 10 points. You were outspent 10 to 1 and it was the first time in 48 years here in Colorado that an incumbent was defeated in a primary. You spoke loud and clear that you want to lead her with a strong message who isn't afraid to lay it all on the line and stand up for what's right. Last year, the Democrats forgot they were supposed to tiptoe around the Second Amendment. Someone forgot to hand Beto a work to playbook. From a presidential debate stage, Beto a work told all of us, hell yes, I'm going to take your AR-15s and your AK-47s. What he announced to his visit to Aurora, Colorado, I didn't waste any time. I got in my car and drove three hours to his presidential rally with my block on my hip. And I looked in the eye and I told him, hell no, you're not. And I did that because I didn't see anyone else doing it. I didn't see anyone standing for freedom. That's my whole life to give our freedom away. Yeah. I learned in that moment, if I spoke up for what I know to be right, I can affect and represent millions. That's exactly what we're doing. That's what this momentum is all about. This is a movement that we are a part of right now. Betty Oglesby takes care of my volunteers. You don't know Betty, you need to go and shake her hands. She just told me yesterday, last week, our volunteers made 15,000 phone calls. Yeah. The primary victory wasn't anything special that I did. That was you. That was your hard work. This general election isn't going to be anything fancy the president does. Senator Cory Gardner does. Or Lauren Bober, it's going to be your hard work. You can unicating this message. Never wait for permission. The invitation may never come for you to share what's in your heart. There are tables with important conversations being had that you need to be a part of. There is a lost in her and dying world. And they are searching for answers and the answers are on the inside of each and every one of you. So I need you to be bold. I need you to share what's in your heart. America depends on your message. Right now I'm up against a far left socialist. In my district, she wants the $93 trillion green new deal. She's had a multi-year love fest with Bernie Sanders and his socialized medicine deal. She wants universal healthcare that would bankrupt small businesses immediately. Diane Mitch Bush hasn't had out. Where she proudly brags that she's endorsed by Planned Parenthood. I will always defend the sanctity of life. Life begins at conception. And as a congresswoman with the power of the purse, I will always tell Planned Parenthood to go fund themselves. That's right. It's a good one. Now I know the personal attacks are coming my way. Please know that I'm okay with that. I know exactly what I signed up for. I know that I'm what's in the way of their victory. I am the defender between you and overreaching government, that heavy hand of overreaching government that wants to come in, steal your land, steal your water, and destroy everything that you're building. I know that they're going to attack me personally because they cannot win on policy. That's right. The Democrats don't like me. The Democrats are terrified of the message that I'm bringing. Because we're telling them that not only do we need to elect President Donald Trump for four more years, but we also need to re-elect Senator Cory Gardner. Keep the Senate. The vote against Senator Cory Gardner is a vote against President Trump. Of course we're going to keep this congressional seat red. Yep. And I'm telling you, we are getting tremendous response down ticket. There are races doing far better than anyone ever imagined, and we are going to flip seats in Colorado. Yes. This movement is affecting the entire ballot. We have unaffiliated voters who are showing up to vote. The National Popular Vote Compact is on the ballot. Last year I spent months gathering signatures. And out of the 229,000 signatures that were collected, I was the second largest signature gatherer in the state of Colorado. Now we have the National Popular Vote Compact on the ballot. It was the first time since 1932 because of a grassroots citizen-led effort. We are able to have an opportunity to repeal garbage legislation. The National Popular Vote Compact steals your votes for President and gives them to California. It puts Colorado's resources at risk, puts Colorado's water at risk, and it allows people like Hillary Clinton to cheat their way into the President's side. Yep. People are showing up to vote this year like never before. Yeah. Yeah. That's why the Democrats hate the message that I'm bringing to you. And they know that I was supposed to be one of them. I was raised under their failed policies. We believed their lives and we were stuck in their cycle of poverty. But glory to God, we broke out and now we're bringing this message of freedom to everyone. Yeah. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. Thank you, Mom. You got my book. Oh boy. Who's excited now?",

        "transcript": " A very bizarre moment at a Trump rally over the weekend where representative Lauren Bobert in one of the most cringe-worthy displays of fealty to Donald Trump revealed something really weird about Trump herself and her relationship with her child. Let's take a listen. I want to tell you a story about his generosity, about how kind he is, about how welcoming he is. The things that these folks right here in the back never let anyone see. Fake media is the virus. My family and I were with President Trump and even not liking germs, President Trump shared a bowl of popcorn with my 14-year-old son. Now listen Wyoming, I know where he's been, I don't share food with my son. But President Trump welcomed him and engaged with him and showed him love and respect just like I've seen him do with hundreds and thousands of other people all throughout America because he's not a politician, he's a family man, he's a businessman and he loves you, he loves America and he will be back again. Um, okay, so I have a lot of questions. Number one, you don't share food with your son. Number two, if it's true that your 14-year-old son is a grubby and filthy, that's actually an indictment of you as a mother. And two, why would you let him then share popcorn with the, let's just say unhealthy OB-summon president of the United States. So on all levels, this is a major indictment. And also just a cro- I don't know. My major question is, is this a real person or is this like a performance project? Because I mean, even the whole thing to like those people in the back row won't tell you the truth about President Trump sharing popcorn. I mean, it's just so... There is a lot going on. It's funny because, you know, the like, what did you say fake news is the virus? Yeah, that was funny. Oh my god. Yeah. They just take these sort of hashtags and slogans from the past. I mean, this has been a long time now since 2016. It's just kind of like replaying, recycling the same hits from the early days. And it's got that vibe of like, you know, tried now the old faithful hits for the crowd. Yeah, also your bar is super low. If this is what you consider to be like... That's all you got. The real tell of like a great... Oh my god, you shared a bowl of popcorn. Don't you have something about him in a veteran or something? You know, yeah, like... It reminded me of Kaylee McAnany told this story about after she'd had surgery and that he called her... Oh, that's right. And this is like so incredibly moving to her that someone who she's supposedly close to, she spends like all her time with, bothered to call her. Like, that's nice. That's a very low bar in terms of holding this up. This is the extraordinary character of this man that the fake news won't tell you about. It's all weird. It's also weird to just be like, you know, with any politician, the way that we treat these people like they're supposed to be our daddy figure or something is also very strange to me. I just completely agree. Yeah, I just, I saw that. I, Jen, I could not get over it. Just in terms of what it says about her, what it says about him. It's like, that's all you got. The fact that the crowd loved it. There's just, I don't know, man, I just bear for this country sometimes. Indeed. Okay. I'm more of you guys later. Cable news is ripping us apart, dividing the country, making it impossible to function as a society, and making it impossible to know just what is true and what is false. But the good news is they are failing and they know it. That is why we're building something new, a new mainstream, a healthier one, something more trustworthy, something that we are going to need in one of the most pivotal times in American history.

        "transcript": " Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boeward, I appreciate you taking some time to talk with us on this horrible day. Thank you for being here. Thank you, Kyle. What are your thoughts tonight after what appears to have been an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, who's also a personal friend of yours? Yes, President Trump is a personal friend of mine and this is certainly an emotional time. This has been an emotional evening for millions of people throughout our nation. To see this assassination attempt on President Trump is certainly not something any of us were expecting, but more than a friend and a President, the leader of the Republican Party, I know President Trump as a father, as a grandfather. I just celebrated my son's 15th birthday yesterday and that just causes me to want to hold them a little tighter tonight. I certainly have experienced credible death threats throughout the years of my public service and no matter what, I have always pressed on and held my head high and carried on with a smile. I believe a smile is a part of my uniform as a public servant and just to see this in action and see this attempt to end President Trump's life really puts a check on us all. I'm so grateful that he is doing well, but also seeing the moments there after with President Trump being escorted off the stage by Secret Service agents and law enforcement all around him, seeing him just as the pump is fist and tell us to keep fighting. This is the warrior that America needs right now and this is the man who I stand behind as well as millions of other Americans and while I'm grateful that he is doing well and okay and he is alive, this is the time where we all need to press and not draw back, not relent because we have the winning message, we have the winning policies and I think that many know that there have been many efforts to stop President Trump, but his policies will be enacted so we can have a stronger America once again. How can America's political leaders take down the temperature right now to keep this horrific attack from turning into something that's even more widespread and even worse? Well, Kyle, that's really the crux of all of this. I believe that much of the rhetoric from the left has escalated to this moment. Just last week we saw Joe Biden trying to excuse his poor performance at the debate and get that behind him and say now we need to put Trump in a bullseye. This is something that I called out from my official Twitter account, my ex account and said that this should not be rhetoric that a president is using and here we are. Now President Trump was literally put in a bullseye after the president of the United States, a sitting president of the United States called for him to be put in a bullseye. I believe that the rhetoric needs to end. I hope and pray that it ends. I'm certainly praying for all of those who were there at the rally today for the family of those who have lost a loved one, those who are injured and of course President Trump and his family. But this rhetoric has got to stop. We have seen celebrities from Kathy Griffin holding a replica of a bloody Trump head to Madonna calling for the White House to be blown up. This is something that has got to end. I have never called for political violence. There is no place for political violence in America. This is a time for us to come together and put all of that aside. Literally, lives are being lost because of this rhetoric and I am calling for an end to that now. I'd like to clarify what you just said. Do you believe that President Joe Biden bears any responsibility for what happened today or does the responsibility for the shooting lie with the shooter? I do believe that Joe Biden is responsible for the shooting today, Kyle Clark, an innocent supporter of President Trump. Someone who loved President Trump and was there exercising their right to support him lost their life today. Everyone who has called him a fascist, everyone who has called him a threat to democracy who said that he should be put in a bullseye as Joe Biden said. They need to have some very deep reflection tonight before another tragedy like this takes place. We know that Americans across party lines fear political violence. That's what they tell pollsters. What is your message to Coloradans tonight? Not about politics, but about their fears of where the country could be headed. Yes, my response and my call to Coloradans tonight is just to reiterate that this is evil. Evil is not partisan. We can all address a scenario and a circumstance and see that there is no good in this. This is someone who was obviously very tormented and unfortunately listened to the wrong voices, but this evil cannot stand. Those who are sorry that President Trump was not taken out and that the shot was missed. There are reports of field directors who work for current sitting members of Congress who are saying that the shooter should have had better lessons before he shot that shot. Those who are still calling President Trump a devil and saying we shouldn't be feeling sorry for the devil himself, but here we are. And that's a Republican sitting state house representative who is saying that all of this has got to come to an end. This is a time where we as Coloradans need to unite. We want a stronger America. My colleagues in the Republican Party, we aren't here to destroy the Constitution or to destroy American greatness. We are here to see America succeed and that is why I'm a part of this movement. We all go to the grocery store and see those prices. We all see the crime and the drugs that are coming in from the southern border. We are impacted by inflation and these are the policies that President Trump is trying to implement to get our country back on track, but instead of coming together and finding a solution, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and Democrats across the nation are saying that Trump is a fascist for simply wanting American greatness and to put America first so we can't help our allies across the world. And unfortunately, it is led to this moment where there is an assassination attempt on the former president and Kyle, you sure know this, but a current sitting member of Congress, Benny Thompson, who sat on the January 6th committee, introduced legislation to remove President Trump's secret service detail. Now, imagine if they weren't there, how many lives could have been lost. And this is something that I'm reminded of each and every day, how important it is to have that detail. I serve with St. Louis, or some Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise, our majority leader who was shot at at a baseball, a congressional baseball practice. That man wanted to kill him and other Republicans because of leftist talking points that he had been listening to and he thought that they were the enemy worth taking out. Steve Scalise almost lost his life, but he had his secret service security detail present there to not only save his life, but every other person's life who was there at that practice on that day. So this is something I'm reminded of on a regular basis. And to even even for a moment think that President Trump should not have secret service detail by him, by his side is absolutely unfathomable, especially now that this has happened. And I would expect my colleague on the other side, Benny Thompson, to withdraw that legislation that says that President Trump should not have a secret service detail. A question for every prominent person in American politics today is whether they are going to do what is within their own power to recalibrate their own language given the threat of political violence. I know we're talking just hours after this has happened, but have you given any thought to that about things that you say and how it might contribute to the heated political environment? Kyle, nothing I have ever said is invited violence. I am not calling for the death of someone. I'm not telling people who follow me to put another political opponent in a bullseye. I'm not carrying around bloody stumps of heads of my opponents, implying that that should be them and that should be their current state. I'm not calling to blow up the White House. I certainly list out the facts. I've been very vocal on Joe Biden's cognitive decline in his mental acuity. And now suddenly all the Democrats are saying in unison that Joe Biden is not mentally fit to be president of the United States. And why is that, Kyle? Because the polls show that he cannot win in this current state. Where was everyone over the years when we saw this cognitive decline? President Trump was shot at today and he raised his fist, almost fighting secret service off of him, yelling, keep fighting, keep fighting. Joe Biden has been stumbling up and down stairs for multiple years and shaking hands with ghosts and unable to form a sentence. So the things that I say to folks are not to cause harm on anyone. I am stating the facts of the leader of the free world and his mental inability to lead our country. And the policies that have been implemented under Joe Biden's administration have shown clear that it interests our foreign enemies more than it interests us and that Americans are suffering. There is no place for political violence in America. I completely am opposed to that and I do not condone anyone who would call for any sort of political violence. But I do believe that there is a place to speak truth and to hold those accountable who are causing harm on Americans. And that is not a violent thing. I think Republicans will show up at the ballot box and that will be our response to today. July 13th, 2024, when our president, our nominee was shot at an attempt on his life was taken. We will respond November 5th at the ballot box and I am confident that President Trump will regain his office at the White House in 2025. Congresswoman, one final question, a clarification and it's also about language. As you just talked about the way that we use language and what that language means, your speech is often feature Christian end times language about a coming battle, about readying people for battle. Now I take that to mean spiritual warfare, right? Now actual violence between Americans. But in case this comes up, can you clarify for folks, given today shooting, given the incredibly heated rhetoric and politics right now, what you mean when you talk about that coming battle? Anytime that I reference the word of God, anytime I speak of Jesus or having a battle in Sue, it is the good fight of faith that I am referring to and that is absolutely a spiritual battle. We are battling evil and good and even the word of God says we do not war against flesh and blood but against principality's power, might and dominion. That is a spiritual battle that God is referencing and I would never call for violence on anyone. In fact, I want peace even in the middle east right now and I wish that President Trump were in office right now so we could experience that peace just as we did the four years that he was in office because he truly had peace throughout the world through strength and that is what America needs right now more than ever. I am praying for President Trump for that supporter of his at the rally who lost their life today. I am praying for everyone who was a part of that experience and really that tragedy and everyone else throughout the world. I know that this is a very emotional time. I have been getting texts and phone calls all day long. People are very upset about this and certainly there are a lot of prayers going out for the President but again this is not a time nor is there ever a time to call for political violence. The left has tried everything they can to take President Trump out whether that's taking him off of a ballot off of the primary election ballot like we saw here in Colorado or through the judicial persecution that he has undergone including all the indictments and everything outside has come his way and now he has even faced a bullet aimed to take him out but President Trump is not going anywhere. He is a warrior. He is standing for America. America is standing with him and just as he said we are going to keep fighting. Congresswoman Lauren Bobert I appreciate you taking time to speak with us on a difficult day for this country and also for your patience in the issue that we had with the echo in the delay in our feed between the two of us. Thank you again for your time. For a thank you so much Kyle.",

        "transcript": " And we're going to make y'all proud. We're going to make America proud. We are going to weed out the deep state and that includes the sorry department of injustice. We are going to take our country back. We will not relish. We will not retreat. We are moving forward, forward from a place of victory. And we are going to put America first. God bless you. Let me know what you think is wrong with Lauren Bobert. This should not be happening when someone wins her reelection by just a dozen votes and clearly has no mandate to speak on behalf of anyone, let alone her constituents. The most losing and election should have caused Lauren Bobert to take a step back and evaluate her rhetoric, her partisanship and her stances on certain political issues. But no, instead she's parading herself on the turning point USA stage, barely able to string a sentence together and embarrassing herself, her constituents and our country. Where is the reflection? Where is the humility? The grace, the acknowledgement that very few people actually support her. So she should be grateful to be serving our country. Those are American ideals. The Republican Party is so devoid of. And it really is an egregious shame. The once great party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan, has turned its back on the ideals of liberty and self governance. Instead it is embraced lies and deceit. The Republican Party used to believe in a big tent, which welcomed the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Now, we shelter the ignorant, the racist, who only stoke anger and hatred to those who are different than us. So here's Adam Kinzinger's farewell speech to Congress, where he lambasts his own party for the type of behavior that people like Bobert constantly display. As you probably know, Kinzinger was one of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump post January 6th and announced that he would not seek election after redistricting in his home state, placed him in another Republican incumbent in the same district. But before you think he's only targeting his own party, he made sure to go after Democrats as well. To my democratic colleagues, you must to bear the burden of our failures. Many of you have asked me where all the good Republicans. Over the past two years, Democratic leadership had the opportunity to stand above the fray. Instead, they poured millions of dollars into the campaigns of MAGA Republicans. The same candidates, President Biden called a national security threat. To ensure these good Republicans did not make it out of their respective primaries. This is no longer politics as usual. This is not a game. If you keep stoking the fire, you can't point the fingers when our great experiment goes up in flames. He's referencing something I covered which was the Democratic midterm strategy of funding far right Trump candidates, believing and ultimately being right in that belief that they would be easier to defeat than more centrist Republicans. And sure, fair, that's a valid criticism. But it's so funny that he thinks these two critiques, one of the right and one of the left are equal. Racism, ignorance, fear-mongering, rioting at the Capitol are not equal to legal electoral shenanigans. The Republican finance rules in this country are completely ridiculous. And of these zillions of problems with money and politics, this particular Democratic strategy is nowhere near the top of the worst. The Republican Party consistently capitulating to its fringes is really, really, that. It's not the Democrats fault they're middle of the road respectful candidates can't win. It's the GOP's fault for enabling and emboldening and moving the over to window making celebrities out of people like Bober and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Yes, it's fair and good to criticize both sides. But when one is so much more deranged than the other, it's not a very good use of your last time speaking to Congress. Thanks so much for watching.

        "transcript": " So we heard some people inside, but the big news. There's some happy folks in there. I am so proud and so honored to announce that I will be the first mom representing Colorado's third congressional district. There is so much in the United States Congress that we need to tackle. And I am so eager to prove to all of my opponent's supporters and anyone who was against me how much that we are going to get done in these next two years. Did you receive a phone call from Diane McEwish? I have not. Not yet. Are you expecting that phone call tonight tomorrow? And he's... We'll see. The campaigns have reached out. And so we'll see. What's the message you've taken from this experience that you'd like to share with others about the American? We the people stood up. We believed in something. We saw a need to be represented and to secure the greatest nation that this world has ever known. And we got together a small group of patriots got together and accomplished so much. I really believe that a way has been pioneered for average ordinary citizens to rise up and take a stand to serve their country. And that's exactly what I'm doing. The United States Congress, the House of Representatives, was intended to be led by citizens. And I believe that more citizens are taking a stand now to serve their country to secure our freedoms. The Midwest campaign reached out to you already. What did they have to say? They did not. They did not. What are the campaigns that reached out to the President? There's been... Representative Ken Buck has reached out to me and Chairman Tom Emmer from the NRCC. And then some other really great folks that I have met along the way all throughout the country who are running their own races and watching mine as well. There's going to be a tremendous freshman class and the United States House of Representatives. And I'm excited. Tonight we are having a small celebration. But tomorrow it's time to roll my sleeves up and get to work. What's first for you as representing Colorado third congressional? There's a lot that I want to take care of. As a mom, as a business owner, I want to be on the front lines of health care. I want health care to be affordable for all American citizens. I want, of course, our pre-existing conditions to be covered and taken care of. I want to be on the front lines of education and school choice. And right here in Colorado third congressional district, we have more than 80% federal lands. And I want to continue America's energy independence and pursue energy dominance because nobody does it better than us. When you defeated Scott Tifted back in the primary, he told Caridio, Anchor, Parkbed, Soul, we expected this. When you first started running for this position, did you expect it to be where you are at today? I absolutely intended a victory, but what I didn't expect was how much support, how many wonderful people that I would meet along the way, and who would come up and really just carry this vision with me and help me run with it. I didn't expect that on such a grand level. I mean, look, this is a tremendous victory. This is a huge win. This is my first campaign. This is my first time running for office. And millions of dollars were spent against me, lying about me, and lying about my opponent. And I'm excited for this win tonight. What's so good for you? What was the point where you said, OK, this is official? I am the official candidate. We were just doing some math, and we don't see that going any other way. And the Colorado Republican Party called, and they're saying that I am the Congresswoman for Colorado's third congressional district. Are you expecting a call from the president? I'm always expecting a call from the president of the United States. OK, first, mom in history to represent this district, first woman in history, first a business woman, not a career politician in history, get the position, how does it feel to make history? This is incredible, and it's an honor. And I'm really just even more honored and humbled to be able to serve the people in our district. And I hope that that spills over into the rest of our state and begins to influence the rest of Colorado. And so we could get back to these conservative values, get back to upholding the Constitution of the United States. I believe there are so many people who get frustrated with elected officials who swear to secure our rights. But then they go to DC. They go to Denver. And they forget who they work for. They overregulate, overtax and overspend, and ultimately destroy everything that we're building here at home. So I'm excited that average citizens are going to Congress. Thank you so much. Thank you.",

They thought I would fail. But you all welcomed me to Windsor, Colorado. And rather than failing, I think it is kind of like an A plus with extra credit with this GED right here. You are all so amazing. And this is about the policies that change our future. This is how we stand for our farmers, for our ranchers. This is how we get a booming economy once again. This is how we stand up to the school boards. This is how we stand up to the unions. This is how we stand up to the unions. The Department of Education at the federal level, which I hope President Trump does away with. This is how we protect our children. This is how we make America healthy again. This is how we regain the American dream. That fundamental principle that keeps us all going, that keeps us all working harder each and every day. My Democrat opponent just called and conceded and asked me to uphold our democracy. And my response was I promise you I will uphold America's constitutional republic. I will uphold America's constitutional republic. I will uphold America's constitutional republic. Tonight is not a win for me. Tonight is a win for you. Tonight is a win for the small business owners. Tonight is a win for ending federal overreach. And it is not just about political rhetoric. I promise you I will fight harder than ever to hold your federal government accountable. Democrats try to have control. They tell us how to live, how to love, how to load our rifles. We hit the bulls eye in this one and we are going to hit the sniper shot that they tried to get on Trump when he pulls out this electoral college victory tonight. We have so much work to do and I am so honored to do that work alongside of each and every one of you. To work with you, to serve you, to hear about the issues that are particular to you. That is where my legislation comes from. In Washington, D.C., there is a lot of legislative welfare. Leadership has bills that they just hand out to members of Congress and say here you need a win in your district will make sure it passes. That is not where my legislation comes from. My legislation comes from meetings in Colorado with the farmers, the ranchers, the water districts, the small business owners, the moms and dads showing up at school boards. I go back to Washington, D.C., and I have chief Jeff Small and I have Tubby Rosenthal and I have Peyton Roll and I have McKinne Hamilton and I have Alex. We are all working together to craft Colorado legislation in Washington, D.C., and I have passed more bills than any other member in the Colorado delegation this year. I have an amazing team that is just as dedicated as I am to this fight for the American dream, for you to have representation. I want to thank the WELGOP for putting this together. I want to thank the Lair Emerge OP for joining and putting this together. I want to thank Martin and Vicki Lynn for opening up the greenhouse for us. Martin Lynn, the founding father of Windsor. Thank you, Daddy Windsor. I want to thank all of you. If you wouldn't mind, I would also like to thank a special group of people in my life. You all welcome to me to Windsor. This move. I can't whistle. I can sing. That will shut y'all up. Y'all welcome to me to Windsor. We have all the news here. They always tell the truth, right? Kyle Clark. Hi. They all try to come up with their own narrative of why I moved to Windsor. This was a family first decision. Many things that I didn't want to be public were made public. Things weren't good at home. My boys and I moved from my home of 25 years to Windsor, Colorado. You don't know my boys. Some of you do. But I do. I see the difference. I see the joy. I see the engagement in the community. I see the reception they've got. Brody, Caden, Roman, my grandson Josiah, and my mom, Shana. This is why I get up and fight every single day. I have not stayed in one hotel after working. I come home every night no matter how long the drive is. There are days that I drive 10, 11, 12 hours throughout the district. Even sometimes end up in a hospital. Get a little blood clot issue. I come home. This year I've been able to make more dinners for these boys. More breakfast for these boys. Go to more sporting events with these boys. And that's because of you. And I want to thank you so much for not only allowing me to serve you and represent you, but thank you for allowing me to be mom. I have my grandson Josiah. His dad's rooting us on. He was talking to him yesterday and today. He's happy Josiah is here. But this is what standing for life looks like. One, two, check. One, two, check. My son came to me at 17 years old. And he said, mom, we're going to have a baby. And fear struck me not because he was what he just said, but because of Colorado's laws, that my son and his girlfriend didn't need to come to me and make their own decision. And so I sat in silence for about a minute and then I finally looked at my son and I said, what are you going to do? And he said, what do you mean? I just told you we're going to have a baby. And now I'm the proud Gigi of Josiah. Thank you all so much. Roman, Kaden, Brody, mom. Thank you. I love you. Since I have the microphone, I'm going to say one more thing. Many of you have heard my life story of being raised in a Democrat household. And it wasn't because my mom was liberal. It's because she believed the lies. The lies of politicians. And it entrap us in a cycle of poverty. We were able to break out of that cycle of poverty. And in 2016, after my mom wrote in Hillary Clinton in Obama's second term. And 2016, my mom voted for Donald J. Trump. And just like you, she is ready for him to win his third presidential election. God bless you, Windsor. Thank you so much. We're going to fight, fight, fight.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Martin. Hey, Triads! 2024 is when we take Ronald back, it's when we take our nation back and we set a path on a new trajectory for conservative values, for Christian morals. That we would be a righteous nation, recognized throughout the world once again, that we could stand up for our allies throughout the world because we take care of the homeland first. We secure our southern border. We ensure that our American citizens are living their very best life, that they are cross-pring, that their children are safe, that they are free from indostrination and critical race theory and conflict and the sector. America is not the place where we just someone buy their skin color or how they were born. This is not a nation where we create confusion in our youth from a very young age. We show them that they were created on purpose with a purpose for this time and they are exactly perfect and holy, made in the image and likeness of God and He did not make a mistake. We're here in Windsor, in wonderful, well-county in Colorado, in our fourth district. Tonight is primary 9.7 of y'all been trying to whisper things to me. So y'all been trying to tell me what you're reading on your phones. I don't want to hear it. Tonight we had a priority and that was to glorify and honor God, to praise the name of Jesus, to invite the Holy Spirit to be present not only in this realm but in Colorado's fourth district throughout Colorado and throughout the United States of America. We had the very little of the intelligent Abby, sing our nation's anthem and men and women all throughout this room stood in honor and awe of this flag. The men and women have fought for, have laid their lives down for and people all across the world know undoubtedly that this is the one true symbol of liberty and justice for all. Before we get to final speeches later, I want to thank you. I want to thank each and every one of you and your neighbors and your friends, your family members. Thank you for those tough conversations that you have had with people. Thank you for educating yourself on this race and forming others about the other candidates who have thrown their name in the race because it matters. Everything we do right now is so important and thank you for showing so much grace and humility and mercy and inviting me to your district. You know, I used to live in Aurora, it's not in the district, but a rapper who a little bit is. I was a flatlander once, you know. I'm back. But thank you. Thank you for welcoming me, my children, my grandson. That's what we're fighting for. My children have the opportunity to go to an amazing charter school right here in Windsor, Colorado, that moms and dads fought for. And we are not going to lose sight of them because it is our moral obligation to give this everything that we have, to preserve freedom and liberty for them, to ensure the politicians who are godless and get into office, don't have enough power to say I'm god and I can take your rights away because we know that our rights come from God, not corrupt politicians. You are right that you have been in doubt with are not the governments to legislate away, to reason away, to purchase away. And that is what I will always continue to fight for. We're going to have some fun tonight. We're going to gather. We're going to support this wonderful business here in Windsor. And we are going to have a fantastic night of victory and it's not over. President Trump needs us now more than ever to get him in the race, in the fight, in the White House. No member, fed. We have a lot of work to do. Don't slow down. Do not relent. God has no pleasure in those who draw back to why not let's press in and take this all the way home. God bless you all. I'll talk to you again soon.",

        "transcript": " Thank you all so much. What is the plan for this? Standing up against the genocide? So actually since we're out this time, I think that we're all on a different whole position right now as a graphic challenge. No more thought because we know that we're not going to be happy to see what it is. But it's going to be like this, it's going to be a different genocide. Absolutely tracking. And of course the Israel has the right to defend themselves and how they can do it. How are you going to stop the genocide? It's going to be a fight. It's going to be a fight. Just the fuck up. We're going to throw a party. Stop the genocide. We're going to fight. We're going to fight. We're going to fight. We're going to fight. We're going to fight. We're going to fight. It's unfortunately going to be a lot of regrets that are increasing your career nationally. And what it means is that the future of the United States can't be glad we're a non-commerist. It is not a complicated issue to say no to this genocide. How are you supposed to say that you will do everything for children here? How are you going to say that with your funds? Find this genocide. It is. All of this is going to be about going to the United States. We are not going to support innocent people in the United States. They want to integrate firms and companies in touch with those who are seekingGG houses. You are helping these women bring them into the United States. Great old amiga TV's drawing é also, I appreciate you so much seems difficult to feel. You've got to be knowing the competitive, so I just want to thank you. We have performed as a group, because it was our honor to be a because our community makes so much money. So I just want to thank you. There is a difficult time, so you will not just be a elected deputy, but also a difficult time in our democracy. And with what is happening in Israel and the fact that Iran is a money from us, it's a proxy war. And what is happening with Russia and in the free, and making sure that we address the economy at the board, mainly, they get people at temporary visa, so we can actually address this issue at temporary documents. So we can actually come together to address this problem. But what you also know is that through all the time, we know the interest in doing that, and just today, we were deciding to work together to compromise on some of the critical funding areas, but really important in the after-motion, but more importantly, interacting with the community is interesting. And since we're talking about how it's actually taking its seriously, and we're going to be bringing a proposal that actually has a set, they only brought funding for Israel, and it was strong for all the members. He doesn't want us to actually, I said, order not to work. He doesn't want us to bring a community in Israel in Gaza. And so he doesn't want us to fund Ukraine in the United Kingdom of Russia. And so we are now starting to see a shift where we thought we could get some bipartisan work here, because this is about the future of the United States, and what are, whether or not we are going to support the pop-rich state in real-leaders in a three-year-old. And so this is very important, but we'll stay tuned if you have did it. I'm sorry for that construction. And just more importantly, what you also know, how great Poland, the evil needs to need, by every day, for the future of this country to continue. And so, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Well, it's been a wild ride. After we spoke last time, I was able to go to be sworn in beginning of January and then I was too close to my due date to be able to fly back to Washington. There's a point at which you're restricted because it's unsafe and I was at home for a couple weeks before giving birth to Sam. Amazing to welcome this baby to my life, but I tragic what has happened every day since, with what's being dismantled at the federal level and what it means for the rest of the kids in the U.S. My older son is so excited to be a big brother. I have a five-year-old and his name's Davis, he's the best and I have a little Sam who's now three months old. It's challenging because this morning, like all mornings, summer good, some start off with difficulties getting the kids out and you know my toddler was having a bad morning and then Sam started crying. You know, just as those moments as a mom, it's really navigating to, but I'm lucky to have a supportive partner. It was really inspiring to see how many women were moved by seeing me show up with Sam when he was four weeks old because there was a vote that I needed to be there for and they were unwilling to make accommodations for our circumstance and thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise today with my newborn Sam and I think it's because so many women are facing the same struggles of how to navigate. I'm taking care of their families and we can sure that they're doing what they need to at work and also facing, you know, hostile work environments that are not friendly and accommodating and understanding. We were able to come together in a bipartisan way. We had a broad coalition of support and the Speaker refused to bring it to the floor. So we went through what's called a discharge petition to force a vote on the floor where it actually goes around leadership and only five and 25 years have ever passed and we were able to get enough signatures to force a vote. Ultimately, Speaker Johnson, I tried to kill our ability to vote on it before it came up for that forced vote. Once we overcame that, he then adjourned and completely stopped halted business for the rest of the week. He was able to put it in a rule where Republicans were put in a position where they couldn't vote no because they'd be voting against many of their number one agenda items and could face, you know, primaries. And so ultimately we weren't able to overcome that but we did get a very close to actually getting it done. I know if we had a lot more moms in Congress, things would look a lot different for this country. Definitely not giving up, we'll be bringing back the proxy voting resolution. We'll see when the best opportunity is but I know the Democratic leadership is very open to looking at this if we're able to get the majority in the next election. I think that women who want to know what to do, I mean definitely follow us for updates and ways to engage but we need more women in places of power whether that's in the boardroom or in government. We need moms voices represented. There's too much at stake for the future of our kids so there's never the right time to run for office. I used to do candidate recruitment and I was trying to tackle women into running for office so I thought would be great and she when I was walking her through, you know, what to expect in that it's never the right time. There's gonna always be reasons not to. She said, well, it sounds like having a kid and so she accidentally recruited me into being open to having a kid because it's never gonna feel like the right time and you're gonna make it work because that's what moms do. Yes, Sam is going to DC with me next week. Next week would mark the first time that I was, I could have officially been back if my resolution would have passed and I could have voted remotely for this time. I was still working in the district but as you know, I've already flown back four times so this will be his fifth time to DC next week so I hope that my son I feel proud that I'm his mom and that that I went to fight for all the kids who was health cares on the line and food and support because it couldn't be more at stake right now. It's so hard but you know, nobody fights harder than a mom. This issue is not going away, we're not gonna stop fighting and we're gonna get this passed but I hope we can ultimately bring Johnson to the table on this. Very lucky to have these boys in my life.",

        "transcript": " I rise in support of HR 1076, the preventing the financing of illegal synthetic drug exact sponsored by Representative Dayla Cruz of Texas. It bill that I am pleased to co-sponsor and co-lead. Thanks to collaboration on both sides of the aisle, this bill offers a well-written study focused on the financing and proceeds of the illicit synthetic drug trade that is victimizing communities across the country. By following the money behind the multi-billion dollar drug trade, we are able to understand the traffickers, operations, and improve our ability to disrupt their activities. The effects of the trafficking has been staggering. Desk involving synthetic opioids such as illicit fentanyl and methamphetamine increased by 22% in 2021, resulting in the deaths of more than 100,000 people of our family members and our neighbors. In 2022, there were also nearly 200,000 nonfatal opioid overdoses in the U.S. In 2021, the overdose death rates increased 44% for black people and 39% for American Indian and Native Alaskans, showing troubling trends and widening disparities among population groups. Compatting the opioid epidemic is one of the reasons I ran for Congress. Like too many Americans, my family has been impacted by the opioid crisis. My mom's addiction began with the over-prescription of opioids which led to heroin and ultimately fentanyl when it started taking over the drug supply chain in 2016. Unfortunately, my mom's story is not unique in Jefferson County, in Colorado or in this country. The opioid epidemic is now more lethal than ever as we continue to see drugs become more and more potent and easier to traffic. It is going to take an all-hands-on-deck approach to stop the flow of fentanyl and other illicit synthetic opioids in this country. And ensuring that we understand the financial networks of drug trafficking organization is a critical tool that we need to protect American lives. This bill will not solve all the issues related to the opioid crisis. We need to do more to increase access to substance use disorder treatment and recovery services. And we need to do more to help support the workforce shortages. We need to crack down on social media companies that are permitting the sale of illegal drugs to young Americans. And we need to ensure that the financial system has a tools to quickly identify bad actors and break up their drug trafficking rings. As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I advocate for leveraging every financial tool at our disposal to pursue the traffickers of illicit fentanyl and other drugs. In this role, I also advocate for every individual family and community that has suffered or will suffer from misguided anti-drug policies, physical, social, and economic damage to have the support that they need. Thus, I urge my fellow members to vote for this needed trafficking study bill. But I also urge them to consider that we must take the time to learn lessons of the past epidemics and take further steps to eliminate harmful and counterproductive policies. I reserve the balance of my time.",

        "transcript": " And Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this rule, which restricts moms and dads from doing their jobs after welcoming a new child. Like so many of our colleagues, it's one of my greatest honors to be a mom. I have two little boys, a son named Davis, who's five, and my little guy here, Sam, who's now nine weeks old. It's also one of my greatest honors to have been elected by my constituents to represent them in Congress. And I can tell you after being a mom here and being only the 13th member to have ever given birth while serving in Congress, voting member, I can tell you we have a long ways to go to make this place accessible for young families like mine. When I was pregnant, I couldn't fly towards the end of my due date because it was unsafe for Sam in your unable to board a plane. And I was unable to actually have my vote represented here and my constituents represented. After giving birth, I was faced with an impossible decision. Sam was four weeks old. And for all of the parents here, we know that when we have newborns, it's when they're the most vulnerable in their life. It's when they need 24, seven care, when taking them even to a grocery store is scary because you're worried about exposure to germs and them getting sick. Let alone taking them to an airport on a plane and coming across a country to make sure that you're able to vote and represent your constituents. I was terrified that no matter what choice I made, that I would have deep regrets for the consequences. So Sam and I made the trip out. And this is our third time now coming to the floor for this vote. I want to thank all the people who have stood by us. I want to thank Representative Luna for being such a champion on this issue. And while Sam is the best baby, he's apologized for the noises here. But I want to thank Representative Luna for being such a champion on this issue. Alongside the rest of my colleagues who have led this charge and supported us in our efforts to pass this resolution. When I hear from members about their stories, whether they're a mom or a dad doing this job, having a newborn who's in the NICU and having to make the choice whether or not to leave their child or come here to vote, it is unfathomable that in 2025, we have not modernized Congress to address these very unique challenges that members face. These life events where our voices should still be heard, our constituents, they're still be represented. Are you going to jump in here? One minute. One minute, the gentleman from Colorado. You don't want men as recognized. And so we are asking you, first of all, thank you for signing their discharge petition. But we're asking you to continue to stand with us because no mom or dad should be in the position that I was in and so many parents have found themselves in. We, it is anti-women, it's anti-family, and we need to come together to make sure that we kill this rule and have the opportunity to pass this resolution to make sure that new parents have the ability to continue to represent their constituents and with that I yield back.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of my amendment, which would require a certification from the Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General that this legislation would reduce opioid overdose deaths. The reason why this is so critical is because we are facing a public health crisis and it deserves a public health response. The current legislation is incredibly problematic for the very harmful mandatory minimum sentences that would be enacted and be very hard to actually address and change in the future. This is deeply personal for me. Like so many Americans, my mom has struggled with an opioid addiction. When I was just six years old, she heard her back and she went home with bottles and bottles of opioids. Unfortunately, after her back healed, my mom found herself physically addicted to opioids. And like so many Americans, she was cut off of her prescription without access to treatment. And my mom said that you fear nothing more than which are all even death. And so like so many people who struggle with addiction who don't have access to treatment, she turned to using heroin to stay well. Ultimately, fentanyl came into the supply chain, started coming in in 2016. We saw it hit the coast first and make its way into Colorado. And now we have seen it completely take over the drug supply chain. I know firsthand how absolutely devastating this drug can be for families. My mom overdosed 20 times that year. And in my fight to keep her alive, I saw firsthand how broken the system was. So fentanyl, but I'm one of the lucky ones because I was in a position where I could advocate for my mom as a state legislator to get her the help that she needed. And after being churned in and out throughout ERs, my mom ultimately was able to recover. She's now been in recovery for five and a half years and is an example of what's possible when we give people the help that they need. So I absolutely want the person who was my mom's dealer who would show up to the hospital, put heroin mixed with fentanyl in her IV. I want that person to go to jail for a very long time. But if my mom had a mandatory jail sentence, that would have been a death sentence for her and for far too many people out there. We are facing the third wave of the opioid epidemic. It has killed more people than all of the world wars combined. It's important that we address this, that it is an all hands on deck to address it at every level from additional screening at the ports and the border, additional screening for mail, where we know it's coming in. Public awareness campaigns about the dangers of taking just one pill with kids who are buying it from social media companies unknowingly and dying from an overdose. Accountability with the social media companies on how we're going to work together to ensure that kids are not able to buy this on their platforms. Increasing access to residential treatment and recovery services like my mom had that are far too often not available for those who are struggling with a disease, a brain disease. And so I absolutely cared deeply about this issue. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on it. But this is not the right answer and that is why this amendment is so important and I ask for your support. The general woman reserve. Yes. General Lady reserves. For what purpose does the gentleman from Indiana seek recognition? I rise to claim the time and opposition of the amendment. Gentlemen is recognized for five reasons. First of all, I want to thank the general lady for sharing her story. These are stories from across America and I'm empathized with her story and I'm thankful that her mother is in recovery. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Gentlemen's residents. This amendment would prevent the underlying bill from taking effect until the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General, each certify that this bill will lead to a reduction in overdose deaths. In 2021, nearly 108,000 people died of drug overdoses. 71,000 of which were from synthetic opioids, including fentanyl or fentanyl related substances. That equates to nearly 200 fentanyl related deaths per day. This amendment is a poison pill that would allow the Biden administration to indefinitely delay the permanent scheduling of fentanyl related substances, which means after the temporary scheduling order expires at the end of 2024, if HHS or the AG has chosen not to act, these fentanyl related substances could become street legal. I don't want to take that chance. Permanently placing fentanyl related substances into schedule one is the Drug Enforcement Agency's top legislative priority. The numbers are heartbreaking. We need to act now to pass the HALT fentanyl act to keep fentanyl related substances off our streets and out of our communities. And in terms of further steps to address overdose deaths, I am glad the Energy and Commerce Committee has led the way and will continue to do so. Last Congress, the House passed legislation with broad bipartisan support to reauthorize many key use disorder and treatment programs. And this summer, Energy and Commerce plans to examine the impact of the Support Act for Patients and Communities Act, the Support for Patients and Communities Act, passed with broad bipartisan support five years ago to address the opioid crisis. But we don't need to wait. Let's pass the HALT fentanyl act now, which adds fentanyl related substances to schedule one upon passage, rather than seating authority to the Biden administration on when this should be effective. I urge a no vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Gentlemen, reserves? Gentlemen, gentlemen, from Colorado is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is important because it's actually for trying to solve the overdose crisis in our country. Let's make sure that this legislation is actually supported in doing that and go through the process necessary. Putting people in jail, mandatory minimum sentences, we know from our history in the United States is not has devastating consequences. This is a public health crisis. We need to come together to address it like that. We need to go after the cartels. We need to go after the dealers. We need to make sure that we're supporting people who are struggling with addiction. I ask for your support. The Generalwoman Yield. I yield back. Gentlemen, from Indiana is recognized. Again, we need to implement the HALT fentanyl act now. Any further delay, including the Biden administration, slow walking its implementation is unacceptable. And I again urge a no vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The question is on the amendment offered by the Generalwoman from Colorado. Those in favor say aye. Those opposed say no. In the opinion of the chair. The next speaker. Mr. Speaker. On that, I want first to the Generalman from the recorded vote, the A's and A's. Pursuant to clause six, rule 18, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the Generalwoman from Colorado will be postponed.",

        "transcript": " At this time, we will hear from a very special person. We will hear from the 2016 National Teacher of the Year. President Barack Obama honored Jahanah Hayes as the 2016 National Teacher of the Year in a very special ceremony at the White House on May 3rd. Our President-elect, Jim McAmando, who's also from Connecticut, represented National P.T.A. there as well. Hayes teaches history at the John Epkinity High School in Waterbury, Connecticut. She was selected to receive the honor for her commitment to the importance of service learning and ensuring students are prepared to achieve success in life. She strives to send her students into the world, not just academically prepared, but as a conscientious and productive member of society. Hayes says it is of no benefit to anyone if a student achieves high grades and tremendous academic success if they have no desire or knowledge on how to help others. Hayes cites her personal experience as her reason for becoming a teacher. She is the first in her family to attend college and gratefully recalls teachers in her life who led her borrow books to learn at home. Today, she passes on this work by promoting cultural awareness and developing service learning curriculum for her high school and her community. Hayes also believes that students need role models who are reflective of themselves. How true. To that end, she has helped secure grants to promote education as a career, especially from minority candidates. I am pleased and honored to introduce Johanna Hayes, a 2016 national teacher of the year. Please give her a warm tigger. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you so much for having me and for the PTA's commitment to the Teacher of the Year program. I don't know where Connecticut is. I know you're here. There they are. Thank you, Connecticut. Jim Ackamondo, who has been so tremendously supportive throughout this entire process. The Connecticut PTA actually gave my class a grant. Every year, I take my kids to build homes around the country. Went to Dallas, Texas this year with Habitat for Humanity, and Texas. And the PTA helped support that. And oh, I can't. I have to thank my new friends from Ohio. I really quickly just serendipitously last night I came in, and I'm in the lobby just trying to collect myself. I've been traveling all day. I was in Washington all last week. I've been on the road for the last couple weeks. And these women kept coming over to me offering me cake. It was very random, very weird. Each one of them separately, please come have cake. Would you like to join us for cake? They had no idea who I was. And then finally, I asked them, are you guys just traveling with cake? And they thought about it. And they said, yes, yes we are. So thank you. The cake was amazing. The conversation was even better. And they've adopted me. So I have people from Connecticut and people from Ohio bookending me while I speak this morning. I think I want to start with a story, just to tell you a little bit about who I am and help you understand why I truly appreciate and understand the commitment of parent teacher organizations. I was raised by my grandmother, my whole life. Well, not my whole life, my middle years. My mother was an incredible mother. Very supportive, very domestic, a wonderful mother, until the point where she wasn't. My mother struggled with addiction in my middle years. And my brother and I went to live with my grandmother, who was also raising my three cousins. So the five of us lived in this home. And my grandmother was a tremendous provider. She took care of us. She cared about us. She worked very hard to support us. And when it came to school though, my grandmother just said two things to us. Don't let me get a call from the school. And don't bring home any bad grades. That was the extent of her involvement in school. And we knew exactly what that meant. So none of us ever got calls home from school. And none of us ever brought home bad grades. And I thought that that was enough. That what my grandmother was doing for us in relationship to school was enough. Until the day where I overheard my teacher, tell another teacher that my grandmother didn't care about me. You can imagine how that felt. It was the night before it was parents' night. And we used to put all of our work in a folder for our parents to take with them when they came to visit. Well, my grandmother never came to parents' night because she didn't drive. And she struggled with a lot of health issues and she had the five of us at home. So my folder was always on my desk the next day. So I'm trying to rush in early to get it so that no one would notice that my parent was probably the only parent who didn't show up. And I overheard my teacher, tell another teacher in the hallway, those parents don't care. They never come to anything. And I kind of choke up even today when I think about that because 30 years later, the razor sharpness of that comment still bothers me. I still see her standing there. I still smell the perfume she wore when she made that comment because I was confused. How can you say that my grandmother doesn't care about me when just this morning, I woke up and she had dough rolled out on the kitchen table and she had a soup can making biscuits for us to eat before we went to school. Every morning we had a hot breakfast. Every day we came home and our laundry was done, our house was taken care of, all of our needs were met. So for my teacher to say that my grandmother didn't care because she didn't come to a parent teacher event was troubling for me. And I really didn't know what that meant or how to process that. So I've always been haunted by the idea that there's a perception that the level of commitment that a person has to a school directly relates to how much they care about their children. When I became a mother, not too long later, I was always very careful about that. I'm going to make sure I go to school. I'm going to make sure I'm active. I'm going to make sure I'm involved. I had my daughter when I was 17. I got pregnant in high school. It took everything in me to finish school. Everything in me that supported my family, my community, my friends to get me through college. And I remember very carefully, there was an event happening at the school and I couldn't attend. And I was crippled by the fact that my daughter's teacher might make a comment about me, the way a teacher had made a comment about my grandmother many years ago. And that just bothered me. I had just started a job. I was working second shift, the 3-to-11 shift. And I was in what they called the working test period. And in this working test period, you couldn't take any days off for anything. So I went back and forth. I have to go to the school. But if I take the day off, I'm going to lose this very good job that I've just secured. I didn't go to the event. And I struggled with that. I called a friend. I was calling around my aunt, my mother, my cousin, can anybody go just so that my daughter will have somebody there. So her teacher will know that her family cares about her. Today, I am a teacher. I'm happily married. My husband, we both are college educated, have amazingly active careers and work lives. My husband is a homicide detective. The hours for that are crazy. So he really has no set hours. And this new teacher life that I've entered into. And I still struggle with not being at coffee hour in the morning or not being at parent's events. Now, here I am, the ideal family. Two parent household, college educated, employed. This is what, in my mind, I think the perfect family looks like. And still, I'm not attending events at school. I say all of that to say the amount that a person enters a school building, or the time that they spend engaged with the school, does not directly connect to how much they care about their child. If you have any question about whether the PTA is still relevant, whether the PTA is still necessary, I would say that my grandmother thinks you're relevant, my daughter thinks you're relevant, I think you're relevant. Because just because a person is not there or is not present doesn't mean that they don't have something to add to the conversation. No meaningful conversation about education. I don't care if it's standards, test scores, compensation, building facilities, school lunches can take place without the input of parents, families, and communities. So as a teacher, I carry that with me all the time. And I try to put structures in place so that no child will ever feel embarrassed in my classroom about the family they come from. That no parent will ever be ashamed of the amount of commitment they bring to the table. And no school will be a place where parents, family, students feel unwelcome. Not everybody, either knows how has the ability or the time energy effort to put into what we expect as teachers. I get it in a perfect world and an ideal place. We would enter into a dialogue and have conversations where we're both supporting students, but people are supporting students in very different ways. And I think we have to remember that. If we want different results, then we have to do things differently. No longer can we put up a flyer that says we're having a meeting at the school on Thursday, please attend. That is not what parent engagement looks like. As I'll tell you what, my grandmother would never attend that meeting. There is no bus in the neighborhood where we grew up. And she didn't drive. But it doesn't mean that she didn't care about me. It doesn't mean that she wasn't doing her part at home to support the education I was receiving at school. We have to look at this through a very different lens. In my school, I've developed programs where I am out in the community. I get it. I am so crippled by the fact that parents can attend parents night that I go the weeks leading up to parents night to our, we have several community centers. And I have open air conversations is what I tell them. And I say to parents, I am in your neighborhood tonight. If you want to talk to me about your child, this is where I'll be. I have just started using social media as a platform. In my district, they say we don't want anyone using social media. But this is the world we live in. If we want to engage parents, if we want to connect with people, then we have to do it on their level with the skills and abilities that they possess. There is a very traditional way of looking at education. And if we lived in a very traditional world with traditional children and traditional families, that would work. But when you work in a school and live in a world where you have students where the parents English is not their first language, where you have students who are living in foster care, where you have students who are being raised by an aunt and grandmother, a cousin and uncle because their parent is incarcerated or they're working at night and going to school in the morning and you have all these different dynamics. Then that structure that we have in place where parents work from seven to three in meetings take place at five on Thursday nights and kids go home to two parents all the time. If we continue to operate within those parameters, you will be talking to yourself because there's about 3% of the population that fits into that box. My son asked me all the time, how come you never come to coffee hour? And I said, because I have to work. How come you've got to work all the time because you have to eat? Well, I don't eat that much because he still doesn't understand what that means. So I reach out to his teacher all the time, but that's because I know how to. Not everybody knows how to navigate this system. We use so many acronyms in education that a parent would need a translator to even understand the conversations that we're having. I'm the national teacher of the year. I say that because for anyone who doesn't know any better, they would think that I know about education. I'm very well versed. And just last week I'm sitting at a conference and I'm turning to my colleagues every third word. What does that mean? What are they talking about? L.E.A. I see it. What is happening right now? And I know I am in the field. So imagine how a parent feels. Imagine how a grandparent feels with a fifth grade education who can cook anything without a cookbook who's walking in a school, having a conversation with people in a language that she doesn't understand and nobody stops to explain it to her. Imagine how that made her feel. We cannot spend the last decade bashing this profession and then wondering why nobody wants to come in and talk to us. I'm sorry. It just gets me so fired up. I live on a cul-de-sac and we have a dog and I'm like the worst dog ever because no, really. I just let the dog out in the morning because I'm tired. But she's a really good dog. All the kids love her so she goes to all the houses and the kids that are waiting for the bus they pet her and I'm like send her home when she's not. And there's one house on my street. Everybody has this neighbor. Get off of my lawn. She's yelling at the dog and I see her. So I step back thinking that maybe she'll think the dog got out and I didn't let the dog out. But what I noticed was after a couple days, weeks, whatever, the dog visits everyone when he gets to her house, off of the grass into the street goes around her property to the next house. Even a dog knows not to call somewhere where they're not welcome. Even a dog knows not to continue to go somewhere where people don't treat them kindly. Please help me understand why a parent would want to continue to go to a school where they don't feel welcome, where they're not having good experiences, where there's negative interaction and you're telling them that you value their input. Stop telling them. Show them that you value their input. Over the next year and perhaps for the last decade and throughout my career, I have operated in a way that would be respectful of my grandmother. I have always been mindful to frame my thoughts, my responses, my content as if I was speaking with or dealing with my grandma because my grandmother loved us in a way that I cannot tell you about but I know what it feels like. She couldn't articulate that. She couldn't verbalize that but she showed us every day. So to exclude her from the conversation, based on those things is not fair, it's not who we are, it's not what education is about. Be purposeful in your interactions. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " and we understand right now the Democratic candidate, Johanna Hayes, is addressing her supporters or making her way through the room there. We're not sure why if she's there to claim victory. She's not officially been declared the winner at least by the Associated Press, but she is ahead, but it is a small margin. Perhaps her campaign knows something that the Associated Press does not know yet. Let's see what she has to say. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Ladies and gentlemen. Well, you all did history here tonight in Waterbury. We are routers. We are routers to have each and every one of you here who has worked so hard on this campaign. Give yourself a thumbs up. And without further ado, let me introduce the new Congresswoman. We'll invite you all to get a chance. Who cares? Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim. I love my mom. Thank you all so much for being here. I'm so waiting so patiently for me to come down and tell you that you did it. We were waiting upstairs for all of the numbers to come in. I'm so excited to see you again. But there is no path to victory. I want to tell you when I started this I knew I couldn't do it alone. And I asked you to trust me out the gate. I said trust me with your voice. Trust me with your voice. And you joined me on this journey. And you reminded me of how good we can be. I want to thank my husband. I want to thank my husband. My husband who has just been my backbone. Every step of the way went over a cliff with me time and time again. Who reminded me that I deserve this. Our kids have no idea what this means or what this looks like. But said we're with you. All of the people, Mayor Haleary, Chris Murphy. Basically said we got you. I knew. You've heard this before. You know who I am. You know what I stand for. You know what I believe in. But the vote show that you also believe that we are so much better together. You also believe that we have to protect the future that we promise for our kids. You also believe that we have an obligation to be of service to someone else. You also believe that true leaders lead from the front and lead by example. And you reject all of this hate and intolerance and this indescribable fear that does not define who we are. Over 220,000 votes were cast in this. Over 225 votes. And I told you your vote is your voice. And you use your vote. And you use your voice to vote for me on not one line but two lines. And the Democratic Party and the working family side. And you said we are not having it that we need somebody to go who is us. Who understands us. Who understands what we're going through. Who is close to the pain that we're experiencing. And for that I thank you. I thank you. This has been such a whirlwind. So many of you. Too many people today. You're watching 5th District Congresswoman Elect. I know you. I think you're the second African American to represent Connecticut in Congress. The first African American woman elected to represent us in Washington. And historic night on this election of campaign 2018. And more to come. I witness news at 11 is coming up next. Let's stay with us for that.",

        "transcript": " All right, got a couple good mornings out there. So I won't even press you to repeat this morning because it's 7.45 and so I know we're still getting our engines going, but welcome to another great day. Want to share that yesterday, early in the day, we were able to start taking a look at the feedback coming from our sessions here at this year's SAS Institute. And I've got to tell you the feedback to this point in time has been exceptionally positive. And that's very helpful to us. And then also feedback around sessions, the value that you've taken away, as well as things that we can continue to do better. So please make sure that you keep that feedback coming. But again, it appears from all levels that yesterday was successful and hopefully valuable day for all of you that are here. I mean, you're taking time to be away from your districts. You're taking time to be away from your schools. You're taking time to be away from your classrooms. And it's critically important to us that that time yield a significant return on investment and that you walk away from here feeling energized and feeling like the time was productive for you. So please make the most of it and please continue to give us feedback to ensure that we're doing a successful job of setting up these sessions. So with that being said, today we have the pleasure of kicking off with some very inspiring folks. And I'm going to ask Marie Cooper to come forward. She was our 2015 Pennsylvania teacher of the year. And then she is going to introduce to us our 2016 national teacher of the year. So Marie, let's give her a warm round of applause as she comes up. Thank you. I'm a teacher. I have had bronchitis for a month for my darling students and so I hope you will endure my voice. I am privileged to welcome all of you to this morning's session and to introduce the national teacher of the year for 2016 and my personal friend, Johanna Hayes. Johanna's route to teaching began as a student. The first in her family to graduate from college, she was inspired by her teachers who urged her to dream bigger and who believed that she was college material despite a challenging upbringing. A veteran history teacher at John F. Kennedy High School in Waterbury, Connecticut, Johanna also sees herself as an advisor, counselor, confident and most importantly protector. She endeavors to fill the role her own teachers had in her life, guiding students to be their best selves and encouraging them to take ownership of their communities. I've been fortunate enough to witness Johanna's magic in action. I will never forget our afternoon at the White House. As President Obama described Johanna's work and her passion about teaching, she became more and more excited. She was practically dancing on stage, actually she literally was dancing, prompting the president to remark, this is what makes a great teacher. You can't be great if you're not enthusiastic. You've got to love what you do and she loves what she does. But as the world watched Johanna, I was able from my vantage point to watch her favorite student, her daughter. I saw her daughter's face change as she recognized her mother's excitement. If her mother could be honored by the president of the United States, one day she too might have the honor. I watched her see the dreams really come true. This is Johanna's gift. She inspires all of us, teachers, administrators and policymakers to do more, to be more and to dream more so that our students have the opportunities that they dream of. So I am pleased to introduce to you my friend your inspiration for this morning and the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, Johanna is. Good morning. Thank you so much for having me. Marri is only telling part of the story what she fails to mention is that when we visited the Biden residents, they had a string quartet that was playing and she grabbed a violin and led the quartet at Joe Biden's residence. Yes, without any practice and we saw our music teacher in action. I, first of all, it's really early in the morning. I am still a little jet lag but I'm so happy to be here and I thought that this morning, I thought that I would be just amongst the teachers who were announced. So there was a little bit of a change. So I just want to make sure I take a moment just to acknowledge all of your teacher of the year and teacher of the year finalists and just all of the teachers who work so hard every day. But this honor has shown me is that there are so many like-minded educators just like me. You know, when you're in the classroom, sometimes you get overwhelmed and frustrated and you think it's just me. But through this year, I have had the opportunity to meet so many tremendous educators who are just as passionate and working just as hard and I am just so humbled to be a part of that group. I don't know where Mike is but congratulations. Um, good luck with this. I don't want to seem ungrateful. I don't want to seem. But, geez, I had no idea that this is what this year would look like. Just congratulations. Thank you for everything that you do and to all the teachers in the room. You just represent all that is good in this profession. And I prepared what I would say today. You know, I thought long and hard about what do you say to a room full of educators and friends that come together to celebrate teachers and people who just represent all of the hard work that teachers do. And you know, there's so much that I could talk about and it's a little bit overwhelming when you hear yourself announce this the national teacher of the year because there's this implication that you can speak to anything. You know, I've been invited to talk about children's literacy or arts and education and I say I'm just a social studies teacher. So yeah, just a social studies teacher and it's interesting because every time I say that someone says, well, you're not just a teacher and the thing is you don't understand that's all I ever want it to be. That's enough for me. Something is some people choose teaching and for others teachers teaching chooses them. I don't ever remember a time where I didn't want to be a teacher. You know, people have asked me throughout this process, who's the one person that inspired you or when's the one point where you knew you wanted to be a teacher and there is no one person or one point. I always knew I wanted to be a teacher. You know, I remember myself lining up dolls and teaching them and playing with them over and over and my friend said it was because I was bossy but I was like, no, I really want to be a teacher. So I don't remember. There is no line of debarcation for me. So when I say that, I am just a teacher. I say it with such pride and enthusiasm because that is all I ever wanted to be. So you can imagine how me, just a teacher, felt when I got the call that I would be the national teacher of the year. Something about that title is so daunting because just so that we're clear, I know that I'm not the best teacher in America. I'm not even the best teacher in my school and I'd be hard pressed to be the best teacher even in the hallway where I teach. So I wasn't sure I liked the idea of this, the impression that this is a competition and one person is selected. But so I went in very apprehensive. But at our first convening, I met 57 of the most amazing educators that I have ever encountered. People who had ideas and energy and enthusiasm and excitement and knew what to do with it. And I just watched and I learned from them. And I went back to my room and I prayed. And I said, Lord, what will you have me do with this? And the answer that came to me was you have to use your voice to share your gift. That's the only one I know is my gift. So I thought about the things that were important to me and the things that I wanted to share with educators, with families, with friends, with all stakeholders about education because my perspective is only my perspective. And in that, I recognize that there is a critical need for everyone else to join in this conversation. I think as educators, we have gotten so used to the idea of not being celebrated or of not being a part of the discussion that we close our doors and we teach. And as long as our students are productive, we really don't feel like there is a place for us in this conversation. I've gone into rooms where I'm so intimidated because I'm meeting with the heads of major corporations or ministers of education or people who are really at a level where they can be impactful in this profession. And I realize that I have the most experience in the room. As a teacher, I never felt the need to become a part of that conversation. And now, I realize that there is a need for all of us to be a part of that conversation. There is a place for all of us to share our input. There are three things that were very important to me as a classroom teacher. And I realize that as I began to work on these things, the influence started to bubble outside of my classroom. I started to affect people in my community. I started to affect administrators in my building. And I realized that this is my message. And now I have a platform to share this message. So I just want to talk to you a little bit this morning about three things that are very important to me. First of all, every teacher of the year talks about elevating the profession. How do we make teaching more attractive? For me, this was so much more important. And I don't know why I made it so personal, but like you heard Mary say, I was the first in my family to go to college. I know I hear people say that a lot, but it was different for me. There was no discussion of college in my household. I came from a community where school was not seen as a way to be successful. It took too long. It cost too much money. It was way too complicated. But I knew that that's what I wanted to do. So everything I learned about school, I learned at school. So it pains me when I hear people say that's the parent's responsibility or let the parents take control of these decisions. Because in the back of my mind, I know that not everybody has that kind of a parent. So if teachers decide that our role ends at the classroom and we don't have a greater responsibility to our students, then people like me, will never survive. I hear people say that all these different ideas of choice and that the parents should get involved and step up and take a role. I was raised by my grandmother who was a wonderful provider. But she didn't have the ability or the capacity to advocate on my behalf. So I relied on my teachers to help me fill out a job application, to help me fill out a FAFSA form, to help me select colleges, to help me write my college essays, to do all those things that my family should have done. Maybe I'm overstepping or overextending the role of a teacher, but that's how influential my teachers were in my life. And that's the kind of teacher I want to be. So it pains me when I hear students, when I ask them about their career choices and more often than not, I do not hear education as a viable option or teaching as a choice for them. We have to do more to change the perception surrounding this profession, to give students a new idea of what teaching is and what it looks like and how they can use their gifts to influence this profession. I always think about my grandmother who really, she never got the opportunity to see me as a teacher of the year. Well she did, but my grandmother suffers from Alzheimer's and it is getting progressively worse. And when I decided to go to school, I already had my daughter, I was in college and I was a mother and my grandmother helped me and this has been a very long process. So it's interesting now that I'm at the end of this journey that it seems like it happened overnight, but this was a long time in the making. And I go visit my grandmother whenever I'm home and she remembers very little. You know, she doesn't really even understand the impact that she's had in my life these days. And I say to her, do you know who I am? And she said, I don't know your name. She doesn't know my name. And I said, but do you know who I am? And she says, yes, I know who you are though. And I said, who am I? And she said, you're that teacher, the one who won the award. So I think about the way my grandmother remembers teaching and the way she thinks of me. And I feel like everybody should think of this profession in that way. The other thing that has really guided me throughout this year as I tore as the national teacher of the year is the idea that even though I knew I wanted to be a teacher, I wasn't sure where I fit in this dynamic. I never had a minority teacher. And I look at my students today and I realize that diversity and education is such a critical challenge that we face. Many of our students don't see themselves represented in our classrooms and they don't know how to navigate this idea of the education world and being prepared for the workforce and life. I had amazing teachers. Every one of them cared about me deeply. But there was still a void because I never saw myself represented in education. I think that we have to do a better job of being intentional about making sure that our students see themselves represented, that they feel celebrated, that they understand how to celebrate the diversity in others and that they take that with them into the world. I think that's more important now than ever. I have students who are asking me questions these days that I can't answer. And I'm relying on them to teach each other about who they are and what they represent. And I think probably the most important thing about having this platform is that I can share with the country how I feel about service and being of service. When I filled out my national application, I had several people who looked at it and they said to me, you spend way too much time talking about community service and giving back to our community and not enough time talking about academically what you do. I operate under the premise that it is of no benefit to anyone if students have high grades and tremendous honor if they do nothing to help other people. That's who I am as a teacher. That's what I believe. That's where I come from. I am a person who was raised by my community. I share that same stage with many of my students. I lived in one of the largest housing projects in Waterbury where I'm from. I have students who live there today and they carry a tremendous amount of shame and frustration about who they are and where they come from. I have students who don't understand all the social justice issues that are happening in the world and want to see a better future. My response to them is be the change you wish to see. My students and I contribute in so many ways to our community and I want them to understand that they have the ability to improve their communities. It's not just they don't understand how they can use their voice and they get frustrated and they want to protest and they want to do different things and I tell them, be a part of the solution and I guess that's what my message to you would be. Everyone in this room is here because in some way you were celebrated. I would encourage you to go back to your schools and your districts and help another teacher do the same. Get another teacher to the point where you are. I think that now we have a unique opportunity to write the narrative, to change the narrative. So often we sit back and people tell us what education should look like. I heard very little about education in the last few months. So I think that we have an opportunity and we should seize that opportunity to become a part of that conversation, to lead the dialogue, to change the narrative, to show people who we are and what we do. Students are depending on us to be that kind of a leader. Students are depending on us to be their voice. I have to navigate very lightly because I have students in my school who email me every day who have all these questions, who want to know what their future looks like and what they can expect. I don't know how to answer those things but I don't think that it should stop the work that's in front of us. I don't think it should change our goal. Everyone in this room became an educator for a very specific reason but most of those reasons have something to do with to improve outcomes for kids, to make our future a better place, to serve our communities, to be the change that we wish to see. I think we need to go back to that place and remind ourselves of who we are and what we do and why it's important and be steadfast in that mission, to share that goal. Marie talked about my daughter. My daughter is also a teacher. My daughter, I had my daughter when I was 17. I was in high school and I struggled to support her for a very long time. In the space of five years I went from a first generation college educated family to a second generation college educated family. My daughter is also a teacher. So I know what education can do. I know how it can change the narrative. I know how it can improve outcomes and hold the promise of a better future. And I know that because I live it every day and it's incumbent upon all of us to help students understand and believe that. I work in a high school and sometimes teenagers can't see that far down the road. While I'm planning for my future, they're planning for Saturday. They don't really understand that eventually this will work out. They don't really understand that this is not as bad as it gets. They don't really understand that there's always someone worse off than you. And I think we have a responsibility to hold them, to support them, to nurture them until they see that for themselves, until they realize it for themselves. While we're talking about all of the things that we have to do and we meet in conferences like this and we talk about how do we tackle the challenges in education, I hope we have some discussion about nurturing empathy in our students, about teaching kindness, about helping them understand that you have a responsibility to help your neighbor, to be a friend, to improve your communities. I think there's no better place than Pennsylvania to have that message. We are all in this together for the coming good. There is no one side or the other. There is no one group or the other. I'm from Connecticut and Connecticut is a very tricky state because we have some of the wealthiest communities, we have some of the poorest communities. We have urban, suburban, rural, we have Indian reservations and you see pockets of students who experience a tremendous amount of success. And then you see students who are being educated in circumstances that are the shame of our nation. That shouldn't happen. That shouldn't happen in Connecticut. That shouldn't happen in Pennsylvania. That shouldn't happen in New York. That shouldn't happen in America. We have to do a better job of making access to opportunities equitable for all students of making sure that the education that a student receives is not dependent upon where they live or where they come from. And we really have to show students that if they work hard, I still believe in the work that teachers do. I still believe in the dream, the promise of education, the future that this country holds. I still believe in all of that. So maybe I'm a little naive, a little stupid, a little jet lag. I don't know what it is. Maybe all of the above, a little tipsy. I went to the mill last night. But whatever it is, I believe in the work that we do. I've seen it happen. I know that it happened and I'm so humbled, grateful, and proud to be a part of it happening. So I guess in closing, I'll just say that all I can do is share my story. That's the only one I know. My perspective is based on my experiences, but that's just a small part of the narrative surrounding education. I think that we all have to step outside of our comfort zones. That we all have to open our classroom doors and share our gifts and improve our colleagues and build culture in our school and elevate our students. We can't afford to blink and just be concerned about the students that are in front of us. You know, this year has given me the opportunity to see students all over the country, to work with teachers all over the country. And I can tell you that there's a need for all of us. There is a need for us to get involved in this dialogue, to become a part of the conversation, to work together on every level. So I am, thank you again for inviting me. Congratulations to all of the teachers of the year in the room and to the people who are not teachers of the year. That's the one problem I have with this whole thing. And I don't know if this is the right place to say that, because 2016 I was named the National Teacher of the Year. Every year before that I was not the National Teacher of the Year. This idea that I had to be recognized on this level and become a part of this group in order to be a good teacher is baloney. I've been doing the same thing for the last decade in my class with my students with the same amount of passion, enthusiasm, dedication. And I know that there are three million teachers in this country who have never been recognized and will never be recognized, that do the same thing every day. And I think those are the real heroes. Those are the people that give us the energy to survive. Those are the people that give us the stories that we carry forth. Those are the teacher who probably don't have the platform or the voice to share what they know. So we are just basically a vessel to do that. So those are the people that I really celebrate every day. This is nothing new. We've all heard this so many times before. When I look, the problems and challenges in education are not that new. We're not reinventing the wheel. I said a couple months ago in Washington. I'm tired of sitting back and admiring the problem. It's time to fix it. It's time to work together. It's time to put our own interests aside. It's time to share our gifts. It's time to collaborate with our partners. It's time to bring in other districts. It's time to elevate other teachers. It's time. It's time. Enough of us sitting around collecting data, talking about what we need to do and what the problems are. We know what the problems are. I don't know if it's because I'm a teacher, but teachers are very practical. If something doesn't work, you stop. You change it. You move forward. Reflexible. We regroup. You don't continue to admire the same problems year after year after year. So as I travel, I always remind people, when you leave conferences like this, use this as an opportunity to have some thoughtful reflection and leave here with some action, some actionable steps about what you can do immediately. It's frustrating to visit conference after conference. I'm out of the classroom this year and I do a lot of traveling. I joke that oftentimes I see the same people at many of these events and I say, well, these are professional teachers of the year. They're like really developed. All they do is go to professional development. I'm like, what, so what, now what? So I think we're at the now what stage. Students are depending on us to be that now what type of teacher, administrator, superintendent, state chief, now what? I would hope that this conference has been a chance for you to collect all that information and come up with some ideas and share those ideas and move forward with the now what frame of mind. So thank you so much for having me. It's still really early. I laugh because people are like, we saw you at the White House. You were so excited. I was like, you have it. It was five o'clock. So I'm here and I'm trying to get the energy. I hope that you hear what I'm trying to say. I hope that you feel how passionate I am about this profession that I love so much. I struggle because people think that, okay, you're the teacher of the year. This is as good as it gets. And every night when I go to bed in the back of my mind I say, what next? What more can you do? I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself to be better. I look at this as not the end but a starting point. Okay, now I have this platform. Now I have this stage. What more can I do? How can I help my students? How can I improve outcomes? How can I go back to my community and share what I've learned with teachers, with students? And I'm always thinking, how can I help in this profession? And I think that that's where we all need to be. It's not about us. This is not about me. This has nothing to do with Johanna Hayes. But it has everything to do with my students and your students and the young people who want to enter this profession and the people who have dedicated their lives to this profession and the promise of this incredible future that I know, that I know we can give to our students. So I am so excited to work with each and every one of you in this journey moving forward to come together and really give all that we can to the profession that we've dedicated our lives to. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Johanna, on behalf of the educators here in Pennsylvania, we want to thank you for all that you do and thank you for coming and sharing your story with us today. You know, as I was sitting and listening, Johanna challenged us in a couple of areas that really resonate with where we're at. And I do believe that we're at a turning point in American education in a lot of ways. And you know, Johanna spoke about standing in the gap and the teachers that stood in the gap for her as a student growing up. And you think about the students that are waiting in your schools and your classrooms when you get back. And the fact that you are the individuals that are standing in the gap for them and that they're relying on you, each one of them with their own stories to tell. Johanna also talked about not only standing in the gap but about leadership and about teachers being the leaders that are building this next generation, not just, and this is what we talked about yesterday, not simply movie students to a point in time where they could demonstrate proficiency on their statewide exam. You know, as important as that is without the empathy, kindness, and character development that Johanna referenced, we haven't succeeded. You know, our students are facing a very different world than most of us grew up in. And if we're not addressing those issues and preparing them for that world, then we haven't succeeded in our mission. And then finally, the third thing that she touched upon, which I think is a good launching off point for today, is this notion about the teaching profession and what's happening to the numbers of individuals going into our profession. I don't have, I apologize that I don't have the exact numbers with me, but I'm going to give you some rough numbers because we talk about this a lot at the department. But in the past three to five years, we've seen a 40% decline in the number of students in Pennsylvania that are entering our teacher prep programs. And I think every one of us in this room can list out the reasons why. You know, we've all been in this work for a long time. Again, you know, my story is 22 years in the field before coming to the department, and many of you have many more years than that. And we've seen things that have happened that have sort of caused this sense of urgency, but we're not seeing our young people entering the teaching profession. And then I'm going to go one step further because we have this data as well. When you talk about students of color that are entering our teacher prep programs, those numbers have not only also dropped precipitously by that same 40% number, but those numbers were low to begin with. And in Pennsylvania, you know, we're talking about numbers that are two digits at times for certain groups that are entering the teaching profession. And then we wonder, especially those of us that are principals and superintendents and central office folks in the room, when we're out there trying to recruit a diverse workforce, we haven't created the pipeline to even get those folks to the table. And our kids are becoming more diverse than ever, including here in Pennsylvania. And it's an important part of us equipping our profession to serve our students well. So let me turn a challenge into an opportunity. So yesterday we said at the Department of Education, we expect all of you to press us to move obstacles for you to do great things. And probably about two months ago, we had one of our districts in the Southwest reach out to us at the department and say, hey, we're trying to create a program of study, not just a typical dual enrollment program, but we're trying to start a program of study that will give our students, and this is in a very high poverty urban area, that will give our students credits and give them a jump start on getting a teaching certificate so that we design this program of experiences with developmental childhood courses, with courses in pedagogy, for high school students, and then with the expectation that they return back to teaching their communities. And they came to the department and said, help us to do that. How do we create this program of study, and how can we use our federal funds to support that? And so we've got members of our team, one of our bureau directors and others, who are trying to remove the obstacles and get that district from point A to point B to do something very innovative and transformative that's going to move us ahead. So this is a reminder to all of you. As you hear these sorts of things, and inspiring talks like Jahan has brought us, and you're creating that list of, hey, we need to think about this in our districts, come back to the department and hold us accountable for helping to remove the obstacles to get you there. And that even includes, for our superintendents and assistant soups in the room, that even includes with board members. This district took a ride out to Harrisburg and brought their board president and board vice president with them to say, PDE, this is what we want to create, help us to get there. We're willing to engage in those conversations as well, but don't let the moments pass and don't get back in your districts and just keep doing what you've always done, because if that happens, then we failed even in terms of this conference, because that's not what this is about. So Jahana, again, thank you for your words. Let's give another big round of applause to Jahana for being there with us. Thank you. All right. So with that, I'm going to turn you loose, make the most of your days. Be thoughtful about the sessions you're involved in and give us lots of feedback. Thank you, folks. Make it a great day.",

        "transcript": " Exhausted. Exhausted. This has been just a roller coaster 48 hours. We waited all day for a secretary of state to come out with numbers. We have been watching them internally based on where the polls close last night and just waiting for the website to keep updating. So, relieved to get this news. Excited about winning for a third term for this district and really just grateful to everyone who came out and voted. And, you know, happy that the Democrats really have been holding our own across the country. You clearly won late today. They're talking about a bit of vote for you and the margins are way bigger than what it was in 2020 when you won by a lot. What's the message that you tell people who did it vote for you? Elections are about math. I won. So, elections are about math and this is historically, I mean this is the fight in fifth for a reason. Historically, in a midterm year with a president power, it would say that none of us were supposed to hold a seat. That I would have lost. So, I'm grateful for the people who did show up and I remind people every day that it's every vote, every person one at a time. But, I'm also going to say that this was a cycle that was different in other ways. National Republicans threw everything at me but the kitchen seat. I put millions of dollars in this race. Really started a month long, all-out campaign to ship the narrative. So, I had to work twice as hard and really fight to hold this seat. And, at the end of the day, I think that that is the message that resonated with the people in my community. That I am one of them, I'm going to continue to fight for them and listen, a win is a win. So, I'm excited. I'll take it. When it comes to policies, a lot of people were voting on inflation, it's possibly the one something that people are still concerned about. What's it be that you would want to focus now about that you're back in office? To continue all of the things that we were already working on, obviously. I mean, I think a lot of the noise that we've been hearing is about the economy and all of the things that are happening. However, the economy includes not just the cost of goods and services but housing, utilities, the cost of food, all of these things that we've tried to address in the house, child care, all of the things that families pay for on a regular basis. I think that we will see improvement in the economy, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, all of the things that we've done just continuing that work and making sure that our focus is not solely on large corporations. But, legislating for people like we've tried to do. What's your message to both people who voted for you and also the people who voted for George Logan? My message for the people, thank you. Thank you for allowing me to go back to Congress to represent this district. But, my message even for the people who did not vote for me is the same. I am still your congresswoman. I will still work for you like I always have. I will still deliver for the reddest parts of this district, the small communities, and the way that I always have. I will still have exemplary casework services that meet the needs of all of my constituents, so that part doesn't change at all. I mean, this is an election, this is part of our democracy. People make a choice, they get out and vote. At the end of the day, we have one winner. The votes decide, the people in the district decide. And I come out in majority according to the Secretary of State and the State of Connecticut. So I am the congressperson for every person in this district, even the people who did not cast a vote for me. Has Logan campaign reached out to you to see? I have not talked to Mr. Logan. When it comes to the House, I know that Democrats have lost a lot. When it comes to the House, what is kind of your mindset going in now that things will be a lot different going into the House of Representatives? I don't think the Democrats lost a lot. I mean, the tradition that we are going to lose 40-50 seats, I mean, literally, there is still a pathway in the House. I think there are some places where people thought Democrats didn't have a chance and have held their own. And the American War play Connecticut is what of them. So I don't think that Democrats lost a lot. But I think more importantly, everyone on both sides of the aisle have to have a firm commitment to getting to some sense of decency, to restoring our democracy, to making sure that we are upholding our norms. And anyone who is elected to public office should be committed to that. Any sort of lessons or takeaways you can take from this particular election, because obviously it was much, much, much closer than how it was in 2020 in the way of election of 2018. Can't take anything for granted. I work for it every single day. You have to get out and talk to people, you have to turn out voters. And I think that's what we did. We really pulled people out of their comfort zone in the last days of this election and reminded them that I can't do this if you don't vote. Obviously, I would have loved to see a much larger margin, but people showed up and that's all that counts. So just making sure that I am on the ground building a coalition and really reminding people of that all along so that we're not doing a last minute push. I'm surprised it was so close. No, I mean, it's the fit and it's a midterm year. It's an off year. I am excited that so many people showed up. I'm excited that labor was just really committed to electing candidates who are, you know, for working people. So that is something that I'm happy about. It probably is a little closer than I expected. But I knew that this race, I mean, everyone told me in my first race, it was like, if you run for a third turn, that'll be your toughest race. It always is. It's an off year. The president's approval rating was low. The economy is struggling right now. So I knew it was going to be hard, but I was willing to fight for it for the people of this district. You still like the job. I mean, it was a brutal campaign. Is it still something? No, three terms now. Is it, are you excited? Or you have one for much of my seconds? This is a long campaign. Yeah, this was a long campaign and it didn't have to be like this. That's the part that I struggle with because this was really a personal attack on my integrity. I drawn out campaign. It was outside money. And I really, really tried hard for my part to run on the issues to put out ads about the work that I had done. I'm thinking that that would be enough. And just really, and ultimately it was, but again, politics doesn't have to be like this. It could be you put out your platform, the other person puts out their platform, you give people a choice. And they decide which one of those things works best for them. There was a lot in this campaign that did not have to happen. So no matter how small the margin is, I'm very happy that that is what resonated with people. And ultimately that's how they cast their vote. What kind of change the way you look at the job going back to what happened to you. Is it because I really love the job you've talked about it before we talked. You like it? Is it still, I'm sorry? The campaign isn't what changed the job for me. January 6 is what really made me think about this differently. But I also have a heightened sense of responsibility because right now people are hurting. And there's going to be some tough choices made in the next Congress. Things like social security, things about things like protecting women's right to choose food security in the next farm bell. Those things are so deeply important to me that a tough campaign is going to make me shy away from it. And I really just believe that we need regular people who are committed to standing up and doing this kind of work. We have to representation matters. We have to have a variety of people from different backgrounds in these rooms at these tables where decisions are being made. We can really share the perspectives of the people that are most affected by the legislation that we pass. So happy to go back. Where do you go from here now that you declared a bigger? To bet. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. And you know, there were so many people just waiting with baited breath for the results. So many people were so invested in this campaign. And I know that the last couple of weeks we had people literally overflowing in here. We had to put people outside on the sidewalk. It was just so full. So I felt some sense of responsibility to those people because they needed a representative to go back to Washington that really was committed to helping them with so many things. So you have this the weight of the world on your shoulders while you're waiting for the results to come in. But we're back in session next week. The work does the stop. But I kind of thought about it and know what that would be like, you know, working over the next two months in a different situation. Is it a concern? Obviously we have a lot of elective deniers. Is it a concern that because this raises so close and maybe that might come up? Absolutely. And that is a dangerous proposition. That is the reason I did not comment on the race while the votes were still being tallied. That was the reason why I hadn't put out any kind of statement. I was waiting for the Secretary of State's official numbers. I mean, they're not certified, but waiting for the Secretary of State to upload those numbers. It's dangerous. January 6th started as a result of election deniers and we have had just so many problems in our country, you know, violent attacks because of that. And people have to be very careful with that. I trust the process. I know that Connecticut has a safe voting process. I waited for the ballots to be tallied, the votes to be counted and sent to the Secretary of State. And then we received that information. I think people need to be very careful with that, planting the seed of distrust in our elections and in our system because it is dangerous. And when that seed festers, we end up with violent attacks like we saw on January 6th. So that's why I didn't say anything about this race. I didn't make any comments. I waited to get the news from the Secretary of State's office. And I think people have to be reminded that voting is how we express our stance on issues. If we don't like something, we vote. We hold our leaders accountable. We don't scale the walls of the Capitol and attack democracy. So that's something that every single person should be concerned about. And it should not be promoted by any individual, any media outlet, any person who has, you know, any integrity because it's dangerous. Good. Okay. You said you weren't going to sleep last night. You were staying up all night. No, I tried, but it was impossible. I mean, you're running up here adrenaline. And as you know, when you're on a campaign at the end of the night, you kind of have, you get the number. So you're running your own tally and trying to cross-referant your numbers with the numbers that are coming out. And they're all not, they're not coming out in the same in real time. So it's a lot of ups and downs, a lot of prayer, a lot of periods of wait, check that again, add that up again. So it was a long day. And, you know, I have an amazing team that literally they haven't slept either. They have just threw their entire heart into it. One of the things I will say. And this is, this is something that I've really been intentional about. My campaigns, my staff, our people have never done this work before. They're not people who bounce from campaign to campaign. They are people who are invested in, in the work, who believe in what we're trying to do, who walk through the store and say, how can we help? So, you know, it takes us a while sometimes to get our legs under us, but no one's going to outwork us. Because these are people who join this team because a policy or something that I'm working on deeply affects them or their family, they don't pack up and go to another campaign. They don't care for the long haul. They wait until we close the loops because they believe in the work that we do. They believe in the work that government does. So everybody, everybody gets to go to sleep tonight. Could you speak a little bit about the entire delegation that Connecticut will be sending to the next Congress and how you'll be working together? Well, we have an amazing delegation. I mean, everybody, I think our work really will be contingent upon the final makeup of the House and of the set of Congress, if you will, because every member of the Connecticut delegation is either a full committee or a subcommittee chair, which is amazing. We have a seven member delegation and everybody has a very powerful position on a very important and impactful committee. So what we would be able to do if the Democrats were to maintain the House would be incredible. I mean, we were able to really fight hard for much of the relief that came back to Connecticut from the American Rescue Plan, which 169 cities and towns are using not only to rescue but to recover infrastructure. You know, I'd like to see the child tax credit reinstated and child care a part of the work we do. Really intentional investments in education, and closing academic gaps. And I have a delegation that works with me on all of those things. So excited to go back. It generally takes a while to stand up legislation. I mean, speaking of the child tax credit, Rose DeLora worked on that for close to 30 years. So I think in my third turn, I'll really be able to push really hard on some of the things I've started and really tried to work on with food security, with special education and closing gaps for kids who have special needs. Those are things that I really think have to be a part of legislation in the next Congress. Sorry, we just got here. If you wouldn't mind sharing how you're feeling and your thoughts on them are really supposed to raise. I'm tired. I'm tired, but I'm excited. I know it was going to be a close race. I didn't know it was going to be this close, but I was well identified. It's fight fit. Everybody knows that. And I think that just in spite of everything, like I said, they threw everything in the kitchen sink at me and put millions of dollars into a race. So this wasn't a race. This was different from my other races because this wasn't me against my opponent. This wasn't a race between two people fighting to represent this district. This was a race between me and, you know, national super PACs who came at it from every direction. So for me to be able to just stave that off and still come out with a victory, I think is I'll take it. I have not. I'm sure they're probably waiting for, you know, an official check mark from someone, but the Secretary of State is the one in Connecticut who certifies our results. You know, the numbers are what went into the Secretary of State. So I'm confident. I felt confident to come out once I received once I saw that statement come out from the Secretary of State saying that we were outside the margin of a recount. And they had gotten the numbers in from all of the polling locations. Do you think there's a possibility Mr. Logan could file a lawsuit going against certain ballots and just sort of a way to possibly recount that is right. I think that I mean we've counted the numbers we've counted them over. Welcome anybody else counting them Secretary of State, but that is right. The numbers that are playing out currently in this race and how election day has played out. Do you have any confidence that the Democrats can keep the House? There's still a pathway. I'm seeing my colleagues from around the country do some amazing things. Races that have been counted out, you know, there was like I said millions of dollars dumped into my race. Some colleagues that have had two three times that amount and they are still holding strong and there are tight margins. But I think in this environment with a midterm year with the Democratic President, the fact that there was not this clean sweep that everyone was talking about is the story in and of itself. We had some really strong in the toughest districts around the country who have really held their own. I mean, and of course there's been some losses around the country, but nothing compared to what was predicted. It looks like the AP called it. So your final message to people in your district whether they voted for you or not. Thank you. I'm your kinder, so I'm it and I'm still going to work for you. I'm Johnny and I prove this message. Thank you for coming out so late. I wish we had information earlier, but nothing changes. You know, I'm not going anywhere. I said on November 9th, I was still going to be living in this district. So I'm here and I'm going to continue to represent the people in this district. So thank you.",

        "transcript": " Ladies and gentlemen please help me welcome John Hayes. Thank you. I'm just a teacher. Hello. Good evening. This is just weird. It makes me nervous. I think I'm gonna fly it. I'm sorry. I am Johanna Hayes. Like he said, I am the 2016 national teacher of the year. And I don't think I'm ever going to get used to saying that or living this life. A little bit about myself, not because I'm so self-absorbed that I want to keep talking about myself, but just because that's the one I know. And as a teacher, I constantly ask myself, you know, what can I do to be better? You know, I can't change every person that comes through my door so the one I have control over is me. Like you heard, I grew up in Waterbury, Connecticut. I actually teach in the same district that I grew up in. I was a really good student. I enjoyed school. It was a safe place for me. I have one brother. He and I were raised by my mother and she was an excellent mother until she wasn't. At which point, we went to live with my grandmother. My mother was struggling with addiction and we had a lot of different challenges. And my grandmother took my brother and I to live with her and my three cousins lived there. And we really became a part of our community. I did well in school, like I said. And in high school, I got pregnant at 17, which at the time didn't seem like a really big deal because my mother and my grandmother had also gotten pregnant at 17. I worked for a few years, kind of living, doing life, and I always knew I wanted to be a teacher. But I didn't really know what that looked like or what I needed to do because no one in my house had ever gone to college. And there was really no discussion about what college looked like or what that journey looked like. About seven years later, and I kid you not, I woke up one day and I said, this cannot be my real life. And I enrolled in community college. I didn't tell anyone because I fully expected not to finish. And I finished when I got my bachelor's degree, when I got a master's degree, when I got a graduate degree. I tell you this because while all of that does not seem like the path that would lead me to this stage tonight talking to you or being on the platform as a national teacher of the year, everything I just described makes me the teacher that I am. Everything that I do every day is about recognizing that kids come to me with different experiences and different needs and it is my job to meet them where they are. As I travel the country, people ask me all the time, what do you teach? And my answer is always kids. I don't think people really get that. Education is twofold. I thought that this was something that only I believed and then I stumbled across some papers by Dr. Martin Luther King in my graduate work where when he was a student at Morehouse University he wrote the purpose of education is twofold to build knowledge and character. And it hit me like a ton of bricks. Our job is not only to deliver content, you know, some of the most dangerous criminals are gifted with reason, super smart, building bombs every day. But what do you do with that information? So I went into a class determined, determined to get to know my students, to connect with them, to build relationships. If you ever question the work that you do or the impact that you make, I can guarantee you that there's a kid in your room and the only information they're getting about school is from you. I was that kid. We didn't have those conversations at home. I knew I wanted to go to school. I didn't really know what that looked like. I knew I wanted to go to college. I didn't have anyone to discuss that with. Don't get me wrong. My grandmother was an excellent provider. She was a terrific grandmother. My home life was stable. She could cook anything without a cookbook. But the conversations we had about school two things she said. Don't let the school call here and don't fail a class and a discussion. All five of us knew what that meant. And the school never called home and we never failed a class. But now what? So I go into my class and I become a teacher and I'm so excited because this is all I ever wanted to do. In the first couple of years, I really focused on memorizing content, being a good teacher. I teach history. And I came into a department with the 14 teachers in my department. I was the only female. All men, we ate lunch together every day. All they want to talk about was the Constitution and Reconstruction. That's all we ever talked about. And I was like, I'm not that smart. I'm not that kind of history teacher. So I really started to make an effort to get to know my students. Because I remember myself as a kid knowing that I want to be a teacher, but not seeing myself represented at all in the faculty. Not much has changed 30, 15 years later. At my school, I am one of 123 certified professional staff for minorities. I remember growing up thinking, if you have to see it to be it, then there must not be a place in education for me. Anyone in this room who thinks that education ends in your classroom is sorely mistaken. It is a shared responsibility. I started to try to convince students that they had a role in their own education, that they were not just passive receivers but active participants. And I started to see what was happening. I started to go out into the community where I live and convince parents to join me as a partner in their child's education. And I started to see some changes. It's interesting because this journey as a national teacher of the year has really forced me to reflect on my own practices. And I realized that over the last decade, I've done some really good stuff. When you're in it, as teachers, we never look for recognition, you just do it. You do the work that needs to be done. But I realized that I've been doing this all along. For the last decade, we've spent so much time trying to remind ourselves not to leave any kid behind that we've forgotten how to intrinsically motivate kids to move forward. We've forgot to show them that they have value. They have worth no matter where they come from or who they are. And as I don't even know what the word is. When I went into this as teacher of the year, I thought all we were going to talk about was education and teaching strategies and differentiation and some of the things I do. And I realized very quickly that it was about me, the person, my whole life, and I was not comfortable with that. But then something started to happen. My kids started to take ownership of who they were and their education. My whole raggedy messed up journey was encouraging them that they were okay exactly as they were. And what they had to do was harness their gifts. And then I got the clever idea. This is the teacher in me. I started to convince them that now they had an obligation, almost a responsibility to invest in their communities and help out. And I see this coming back twofold. A couple of years ago, I teach in AP government class. And I was very disappointed because my scores were not where I wanted them to be. And one of my students said to me, but Mrs. Hayes, every single one of us registered and voted. Okay. Our job is not just to produce taxpayers. More importantly, we have to produce citizens. When my students look at me and they want me to answer their questions about what's going on in their world, and then we are responsible for each other. If kids don't leave us knowing that and understanding that, then we have not done what we have been charged to do as teachers. I am so grateful to the adults in my community who stood up and did jobs that did not belong to them, to the people in my neighborhood, to the teachers in my school who did not end their day and say, that's not my job. This is not my responsibility. But took a personal investment in me. That's the only reason I'm standing here today. There are so many of my kids every day who come to school. And I send them off. And I pray every night that they'll come back the next day. We have to give kids a reason to come back to school. For me, that was the only constant. That was the only safe place. That was the only place where I mattered. Today, I know that it's the only place where I make a difference. So as this year, this whirlwind of a year, I struggle with, you know, where is my voice? What am I supposed to do? What is my role? And I think it's almost serendipitous that I end up here today in Little Rock, Arkansas. Because as part of the Connecticut Teacher of the Year process, it's a very rigorous process. But I had a group of people come out to my school and observe me teaching. I had to present a portfolio. I had to do a lesson. And the lesson I taught was on a book that my students read, you probably all know it. Warrior's don't cry by Melba Patilla Beals. So today, and I almost wish they hadn't taken me there because it really, I was so conflicted when I left Central High School. I went there today. And I walked on the ground and I could just feel the energy and I could feel the responsibility. And I said, we have to do more, you know, as educators, we have to do more. We cannot send kids into the world feeling like nothing has changed. And I went back to the hotel and I called one of my coworkers. And she reminded me of something that happened a few weeks ago. One of my students said to me, Morgan, you could probably tell with a name like Morgan, who Morgan is a white student that I have. And she said to me, I'm so glad I had you as a teacher because you have shown me that what my father says about black people is not true. That reminded me that I'm already doing my part. You know, I'm already teaching kids that we are so much better than what you see. We are so much better than what you hear. We are so much better than what we've come to expect. I ask myself every day, is this an education that I want my child to receive? If you can't answer yes to that question every single time, then you need to change what you're doing. I am so proud of this profession. I am so proud of teachers. And if you want to know how do we elevate this profession? How do we attract people? Every day we go out there, game tight on our best performance. We are getting observed every time we stand up, not by our administrators, but by our students, by our parents. They go out into communities and they talk about who we are and what we do and how we've inspired them. Make an investment in your students. Love this profession as much as I do. Know that what you are doing is truly making a difference. Thank you. I'm done, but I'm watching the clock and I don't want them to give me the hook. But really, I just... I stand here and I just remember being 17 years old and feeling like nothing was ever going to change. I remember going home and wanting an education so badly and talking to my grandmother and her telling me you need to get a job. And there are so many of your kids who are going home and having those same conversations and not it's a one-way conversation. You have to be the other end of that dialogue. You cannot assume that the parents are taking care of it or someone else's responsibility. I'm sure my grandmother wanted to do better, but that was as good as it got. That was all she knew. She felt like that she was providing for us. We went to school every day with a hot breakfast. We came home. She took care of the house. And she was an amazing provider. But she didn't feel equipped to be an advocate for our education. And I see so many kids and I think that's how I've connected with my parents because I remind them that it's okay. It's okay that you don't know everything about education. The beautiful thing is that we're going to work together and get this done. We're going to work together and get this right. And I care about your child just as much as you do. And when we talk about the last decade where people have been bashing this profession and bashing education, we have a tremendous opportunity. I know I do. I have been propelled into a trajectory where I am on a platform and I have a stage and a voice to tell people what you hear is not all education is about. For the 95 things that are going wrong, there's five things that are going really, really right. And I'm the product of that. And if you ever feel like this isn't working, this is helpless. Don't wait for policy or legislation or someone else. The next big idea to fix education. I say to myself all the time and I say to my students, a flood is just a million tiny drops. Do your part. Don't wait for the law to change or education to change. In my district, I said to them, I said I have a problem with the fact that we haven't four minority educators in a building with 123 certified professional staff. And my superintendent says I'm not really sure what we can do. I went online. I apply for a state grant secured 75,000 dollars for my district to start a program to engage kids in teaching as a career. Don't wait for somebody to do it. Be the change you wish to see. I think I'm in a very unique position because I get to see in real time the impact of the work that I've done. As the national teacher of the year, my students were interviewed. I'm hearing some of the things they say and it's funny because it's like a running joke in my class. I tell kids teachers never know how good they are until they get you-legized. Everyone shows up at the funeral. She was a wonderful teacher. I loved her. I remember this one time. Right? I'm hearing this in real time and that is so empowering. And the thing is, it just makes me want to do more. You know, it makes me feel more responsible. It makes me feel more eager to work. When I went to central high school today, it made me- I call my coworker, we have to do more. The work is never done. The teaching is not for the faint at heart. If you're looking for- I think we started with Summers Off. You're in the wrong profession. I haven't had a day off since April. Seriously, there are no Summers Off in this profession. You already know. But kids- I don't even know if- rely is the right word or depend. Like, I was inextricably connected to my teachers because I saw them as the path that was going to get me out of building nine in that housing project. So, if you ever question the work that you do, you know, if you have a new teacher coming in, show them what's wonderful, what's amazing, what's great, what's good about this profession, because we are change agents. We are the promise of the future. We are the next big thing. You know, so thank you for the work that you do. Thank you for having me here. I am so grateful to be counted among such a noble profession.",

        "transcript": " Mr. Dunn, you recognize your five minutes. Thank you, Chairwoman to get. I am obviously pro-life and I appreciate the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson returning jurisdiction to the states. As my colleagues have previously stated today, the Constitution does not explicitly guarantee the right to the abortion, I believe, that the legislative decisions regarding abortions always should have been made by the states and going forward. I hope that they will be. I am troubled by the extreme behavior of many, radical, pro-choice activists who threaten and, in fact, did burn crisis pregnancy centers, as well as those who continue to threaten and harass our Supreme Court justices and their families over this decision. I hope that we will return to some level of civil discourse as this conversation continues. Misinformation is running wild in the national debate about abortion scaring women into believing that they will be left to die of face with an ectopic pregnancy or claims that they will be in-prisitive pregnancy. These claims serve only to emboldened radical activists who push wild policies. And I think this inflammatory brand of activism is appalling and it must stop. Madam Chair, I have no questions. And I will yield the remainder of my time to ranking member Griffith. Gentlemen, it's recognized. Thank you very much. Dr. Resnick, according to a 2019 opinion article and mid-page today by Dr. Kevin Campbell, he asserts that currently or at that time only approximately 12.1% of all practicing physicians in the US were members of the AMA. Is that accurate? Our total representation numbers among physicians and medical students who are the basis for our membership are well above that. Well, specifically in the article excluded medical students. But it's in between 10 and 20, is that fair? That's the number of people who pay dues. But I want to be very clear where our policy comes from. And our policy comes from a house of delegates in which every specialty and every state medical association is represented. Really comes from your membership group. Nope. It comes. So state medical associations and specially societies, all of them are represented in the house of delegates. So even though only 10 to 20% at most of the membership is practicing physicians, the AMA claims to speak for all physicians as a whole. We do speak for the profession, because the profession comes together twice a year as a whole to make our policy. That's how our policy works. But you agree just like we don't agree up here that there's a lot of disagreement amongst physicians. People come to a topic like abortion, obviously, with their individual approaches. But I would welcome you to come to one of our house of delegates meetings and see that process and see that it's a very democratic science-based process where everybody expresses their opinions and votes happen. Who do you believe is the patient when it comes to an abortion, the baby, the mother, or both? You don't have to defer to Dr. Verma. And I want to reflect on definitions. I'm going to yield then to my time to Dr. Burgess. Thank you. I want the AMA. That's not half the ability to, it's Mr. Dunst. I'm happy to reclaim the time and yield to Dr. Burgess. Gentlemen, you're recognized. Thank you, Dr. Dunn. Dr. Francis, you heard the earlier exchange that Dr. Verma and I had about R.H.I. Sumonization, blooding compatibility. Most people nowadays are not aware of the fact that prior to 1968, there were a certain number of pregnancies that were lost, secondary to R.H.I.I. compatibility between the mother and the baby. Look, I practiced OBGN for 25 years. I consider myself a specialist in obstetrics, scionicology, and defensive medicine. And good defensive medicine would say that, rather than cut a corner with a medicated assisted termination, that you provide that security of coverage with rogam after a pregnancy loss, whether it be spontaneous or elective, is that not correct? Absolutely. And even though the risk is low, as you stated, it's not zero. And when I practiced in Kenya, saw babies affected by R.H.I.I.I. so immunization because they didn't have access to rogam. But even more dangerous than that, is giving a woman these medications when you don't know her gestational age accurately. At 10 weeks, one in 10 women will need a surgical completion of their abortion. Just three weeks later, one in two to three women will need a surgical completion of their abortion. And so accurate dating of a pregnancy is crucial. And again, even per ACOG's own document, up to 50% of women will be wrong about their gestational age based on their last menstrual period alone. So bottom line is not a good idea to cut corners just to be administering abortion medications. Thank you for your participation today. I'll you back to Dr. Dunn.",

        "transcript": " Well, here at EWTN News Nightly, we are profiling recently elected Catholic Congressman and up next Florida Representative Neil Dunn. Congressman Dunn, welcome to EWTN News Nightly. Thank you very much. It's great to be with you. In the wee hours of the morning, Congress took the first step toward repealing Obamacare and the hope is that defunding Planned Parenthood will be part of that process. Talking forward, what else does Congress need to do to support life? Well, let me say that we have been assured that the defunding of Planned Parenthood will be a part of that process. It's near and dear to the hearts of the entire caucus. So we will be certain that that's in there. There's a lot of work to be done to repeal that and replace it, but we are ready for that. We have a plan for that. It's going to be a smooth transition. There will not be any gaps in coverage. There is going to be... Nobody is going to lose their coverage or their care, whether they are just paying for coverage or in the middle of cancer treatments. Everybody is going to have a smooth transition. You are a physician and a military veteran and now a new member of the Veterans Affairs Committee. Donald Trump has nominated David Shulkin, a current Veterans Administration official to be secretary. What needs to happen to fix the VA? The Veterans Administration, I have dealt with it. I have actually served in it as a military physician. We took care of an awful lot of those patients. Still took care of a lot of those patients in private practice, but that's a system that really needs to be fixed. I think the first thing we do is we provide the veterans with more choices for their care. And what does that mean? Well, so they don't have to go to a Veterans Administration hospital or clinic to get their care. They get their primary care where they live, as opposed to 90 or more miles away someplace, which often happens now, then that just has to provide better care. More continuity of care, too. If they see the same doctor, the same clinic, people who understand and develop a relationship with the patient. How would that work? The money from the Veterans Administration must follow the veteran. So if he gets treated locally by a physician, then that money follows him. He chooses to go to the Veterans Hospital. Fine, because to the Veterans Hospital, let's look at the Veterans Guide us on the pathway to what's the best source of care for them. And before we let you go, as we are asking all of our new Catholic congressmen, how will your faith define your service? Well, so I have been, I'm Catholic. I've been all my life Catholic, and that means I'm pro-life, and I'm pro-life all my life, too, not just for the campaign. And I think that that is a definition. We've seen a real effort to secularize government and secularize our laws. But when we look back historically at the Constitution and how our government was founded, I think as you'll see that there was a great deal of faith in the divine providence that oversaw the birth of America. And I think that's an integral part of our heritage. Representative Neal Dunn, thank you so much for joining us, a Republican from Florida. Thanks very much. I look forward to seeing you.",

        "transcript": " The general lady yields the chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Dr. Dunn, for five minutes of questions. Thank you very much Mr. Chair. As a doctor, he pains me to read about the code patient. It could touch him while being prepared for donation obviously, woke up and thrashed him around and felt terrified. Fortunately, one of the doctors performing a pre-dotation procedure expressed as discomfort. But the OPO who is present to actually disagree with him shot him down to say, the OPA's staffer notes indicate he was accusing him of euthanasia. Embarrassingly, on the honor walk for this patient, the patient was regaining consciousness and when he brought the operator, he was actually curled up at a ball. His knees on his chest. Thank goodness for the doctor and the operator. This is a story that seems to be more fitting for a movie than a congressional hearing, frankly. Mr. Massey, here's the CEO of Network for Hope. Less than a year ago, you merged with CODA in what capacity does the former CEO of CODA serve in your organization? The former CEO of Kentucky Organitarian Affiliates currently serves as our COO. We made several changes in the executive. So, and you have other CODA organ operation staff, perhaps surgeons still with you? They are, but not in their same role. Everybody within the executive team took a much more focus on the company. I'm trying to concern that anyone involved in this misconduct is continuing to work with you in the field, frankly. As a medical doctor, I find the recent increase in donations after circulatory death, as opposed to brain death, particularly concerning. We always use brain death as a criteria when I was in the business. And very death confirmed by multiple physicians. Concerned of the current safeguards in the DCD process is simply not enough to secure patient safety. Dr. McBride, I'm under the impression that you know this place are all with encouraging patient organ procurement, through the DCD type recovers us a circulatory death. And I want Mr. Chairman, I would offer into record two articles. The first says, 26 OPAs joined new you-nose lead collaborative to increase DCD donor recoveries. And that one stated 21, April of 21. And the second one is you know this using collaborative improvement model to increase DCD long trips plantation. I ask unanimous consent to have these placed into the record. So ordered. Thank you. I obtained these by the way through the wayback machine because they're no longer on your website. They've been taken down. It's suggested that there was a reason you took them down. What's their doctor me? Thank you for the question, Congressman. Those reports refer to a collaborative work project that was done under the direction of HRSA and in partnership with the OPTN. Okay, so I'm going to just be claiming my time because we're running out. You know last year's hearing on this subcommittee after that the Association of your Corbin, like organ procurement, or pen the letter openly criticizing this congressional committee for advancing false misleading and unsupported allocations after reviewing and hearing all the data here today. Do you still agree with that? Congressman, I disagree with the way that letter has been characterized. I believe the letter actually called for an open conversation with Congress, with experts in the organ donation. Let me just say I think it's disturbing to me that anyone would consider the congressional oversight, which is one of our jobs, is somehow damaging to public trust. A congressional oversight doesn't harm public trust. What happens to public trust gets harmed when our trusted partners in organ procurement district guide process and put patience in danger. Several of you lectured today on the importance of transplant surgery and transplant donors. I promise you we understand the importance of transplantation. Doctors and laypeople in Congress alike, but it's not right, it's not moral, it's not ethical to kill a patient who can potentially live and take their organ. And if America fears that your OPO is doing that, you're going to lose your pool of donors. Simply, America should be confident that you are performing your own oversight and we are too. I commit that we will continue to provide oversight and we will do everything in our power to make sure that bad actors in this field do not continue to behave this way. Thank you.

        "transcript": " Chairman, Chair Con, thank you for appearing before this panel today. Congressional oversight of the FTC is an important part of the American political process. Small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone and rural communities throughout American including Florida's second congressional district. These include regional and local grocery stores and convenience stores, which are typically the only source of essential groceries and other consumer goods in many small towns in my district. Last year as our nation faced broken supply chains and rising prices, I sent a letter to the FTC asking commission to use its existing authority to study conduct that could violate laws under its purview. My primary concern is when rural stores are taken advantage of in such unstable times. Many towns and small rural communities have become food deserts after their local grocery stores were on a business in addition. Many of these businesses are family owned and provide the only viable option for individuals who don't have access to adequate transportation and travel to larger chain stores, which may be hours away. The independent small and medium-sized groceries are telling me that big-boxed-star stores are forcing them out of business. So Chair Con, Section 6B of the FTC Act empowers the FTC to require companies to respond to questions about business practices. Where are you currently in the 6B process on independent groceries and food supply chains and have you formally inquired about monopolistic practices, farming independent and regional groceries? Thanks for that question, Congressman. I couldn't agree more that these are especially troubling concerns that we're hearing from independent retailers, especially independent grocers. One six-speed that we launched early in my tenure was to understand whether the supply chain disruptions that we had seen were being exacerbated by asymmetries of power that we may see between the small independent stores and the big chain stores. So my question was, have you actually formally started that 6B process for inquiry? Yes, we have. Excellent. So last Congress, then ranking members Rogers and Bill Rockes, sent a letter to Secretary of Commerce Ramondo. We mentioned that earlier today. Requesting Secretary work with stakeholders across the federal government to prevent supply chain disruptions throughout Americans, especially in rural areas. And have you been working with the Department of Commerce on that particular effort? I'm not sure if we're working with them on this specific issue, but generally, we try to take a whole local government approach to these issues. All right. So I'd like to recognize and actually commend the Commission's bipartisan May 2021 report called NICS, the Fix. It was an FDC report to Congress regarding restrictions on repairs on various products. The vote was 4 to 0 on that ruling in 2021. This congratsionally directed report highlighted the unsustainable rising cost of vehicle maintenance and repair. And it prompted the need for Bill, my bill HR906, the repair act, which seeks to restore consumer choice and competition vehicle repair sector. The NICS, the Fix report highlights the important ways in which bipartisanship at the FTC can result in positive legislative actions afterwards. So after all, the Congress did create the FTC. We're glad that upon passage of that bill, vehicle owners will be able to repair their own property and repair shops can continue operating without fear of being put out of business. Unfortunately, bipartisanship does not seem to be the order of the day currently at the FTC. Ms. Conn, I find it striking at the FTC commission or the commissioner, Christine Wilson, resigned in protest of your partisan conduct as Chair. Chairman Bill Iraqis, I'd like to submit this February 14, 2023 Wall Street Journal article why I am resigning as an FTC commissioner for record. Without objection, so order. Thank you very much. Chair, Commissioner Wilson, Skade in review of your agency cited first your violation of due process given your failure to recuse yourself from a meta acquisition case despite clear legal precedent that require you to do so. Second, your colleagues and staff's excessive redactions to her written objections and dissent in your ruling in order to protect you. And third, the staggering 49% less than half of the FTC employees recently pulled will leave that senior FTC agency officials maintain high standards of honesty and integrity for comparison in 2020 just prior to your appointment. 87% thought FTC officials had high honesty and integrity standards. So you have an answer to that question, Chair Conn. Thanks, Marcus. And I'll just say I'm incredibly proud of the FTC staff who day after day are on the front lines of protecting Americans from unlawful business practices. There's no doubt that early in my tenure, there were things we could have done better or differently. But since then, we've been taking these survey results seriously and taking steps to make sure we're fully understanding what was the source of these declines and identifying what changes we can put in place. My time is expired and I yield back to the Chair. I'll submit the ring or my questions for anyone who yields back.",

        "transcript": " So strategic competition with China is one of the defining issues obviously of this Congress. And now more than ever we must be focused on understanding and responding. I think each of you for showing up, it's my sincere hope that the Congress and the administration can work together to fulfill the mission of the sake of the American people. Unfortunately, a number of the policies of this administration have only emboldened the leadership of CCP and I think, speak of McCarthy, he was correct, but he said the danger posed by our dependence on China is dire. We could go on and on about China's growing hold on the U.S. from supply chains and economic dependency fentanyl. But what we need is a course correction. However, today I want to consider one of the very real threats China poses to some of our allies and friends specifically, those in the Indo-Pacific region, the Pacific Island nations. The U.S. relationship with the Pacific Islands was forged 80 years ago when millions of Americans left their homes to fight for freedom on the beaches of Terroir, Pella Lune and the jungles of Guadalcanal and Bougainville. Over 100,000 Americans sacrificed their lives. And after the war, we mostly withdrew from the region. There were still some U.S. presence. I actually had the privilege of serving the Pacific Islands as an army surgeon and I provided care many of those nations, meeting those people under those conditions. You get to know them and these are really good people. Largely, there's been a posture of neglect. The people we fought alongside have and helped liberate. We've forgotten. Well, let's recall we needed access to those islands when we wanted to take the war to Japan. And now they're under attack again. A poster. We have our poster. Good. The poster just caught up on the screen behind me illustrates how the CCP has infiltrated our friends in the Pacific Island nations. The countries in red recognize Beijing. Countries in green recognize Taiwan. There used to be a lot more green. If a country recognizes Taiwan, that means it doesn't have a Chinese embassy there. As you likely know, these embassy act as hubs and incubators from all-in activities. That's why we closed our Houston consulate in 2020. The CCP is counting on the U.S. to remain passive in these countries so that they could take over. The islands are just as valuable strategically to China as they were to Imperial Japan. The CCP is launching a new kind of attack, mostly on the political warfare front, but the effects on the ground are very, very real. And they include economic dependency and social destruction. This is China's greater new wall, greater wall of China. We're obligated to remember our bonds with the good people of Pacific islands to rebuild these bonds and to work with them to defeat the attack on their freedoms, and quite frankly, our strategic interests. Secretary Clinton break the then president of the Federal States of Micronesia, David Panamelo, released three letters over the last two years that laid out in detail the PRC's comprehensive and pernicious political warfare against the Federal States of Micronesia and other islands as well. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to end those letters into the record. Mike. Thank you. The letters, by the way, the title of the article letter to company's letters is Micronesia's President Wright's bombshell letter on China's political warfare, authored by Cleopascal and the diplomat. So his letters were a cry for help from us. In his March 23 letter, President Panamelo wrote, as a result of aggressive political warfare on his country by Beijing, he was in well-advanced negotiations with Taipei to switch his country's recognition back to Taiwan. This would have been a huge win for the free world, adding people of Micronesia, but it didn't happen. When you explained to me what the State Department did to assist the Federal States of Micronesia Taipei negotiations at that time? Congressman, I don't know if I can respond specifically to what happened right at that time, but what I can say is absolutely agree with you about the centrality of our partnerships with our Pacific Island friends. Under this administration, we have dramatically stepped up our game. Thanks to support from Congress, we're expanding our diplomatic footprint in the region. We've opened new embassies in the Solomon Islands in Tonga. We are working on opening in most time. My time unfortunately, Sparrow, I will submit other questions for the record. Thank you. I yield back.",

        "transcript": " So we're going to start now with a fantastic opportunity that we have to talk with Congressman Dr. Neil Dunne. So hopefully the technology is going to work and we're going to move so that we can bring Congressman Neil Dunne into the room. There he is. So Congressman, thank you so much for joining us today. You are facing on two large theater-style screens in front of this audience. You are facing some of the premier healthcare executives, leaders, advocates, the people who make the healthcare system work here in the state of Florida. So that is the audience that you have in front of you. The Congressman is a physician from Panama City. Maybe I should let you introduce yourself here in just a moment. But a district that extends from a little bit less to Panama City to Tallahassee and a bit south of there, like many congressional districts, it has kind of a strange shape. Thank you very much Dr. Smith. I appreciate your introduction. I appreciate the chance to be with you here today to talk about something that's near and dear to my heart. And that's of course a healthcare policy. And you know, we couldn't look at that at a different points of view. And that came out in your introduction. You know, you have around the table the doctors, the patients, the insurers, the payers, the pharmaceutical companies, the medical device companies, the governments who are as payers as well as regulators. And then of course, you have the lawyers. And I should say both state and federal. So let's take a look at this total point because it's pretty confusing. In fact, it makes the Democrats versus the Republicans in Congress look easy. And to the fact that everybody thinks they know just exactly what's needed. Oh, just a little more money for them. And that adds a lot of confusion to it. So now I'm a doctor obviously. So it's easy to pigeonhole me in my attitude and say, you know, and to some extent, I certainly do bring a bias about the doctor patient relationship. But I want you, by the way, the doctor patient relationship, I think, is a concept that's enshrined in U.S. law, both in statute and common law. I want to share this group. I've spent time in most of the seats around the table, for instance, I mean, insurance chair, I sat on the advisory board of cost blue shield for a number of years. We had a very fruitful relationship, honest, mutually beneficial to blue cost blue shield, the doctors and the patients. I also sat on the board of an association health care plant that was very effective at limiting rating increases over the years and provided first class coverage for tens of thousands of families. On the payer side, I've run several companies, my own, I've offered ERISA health plans to, to over 900 families at one point. And just in my medical practice, we had 750 families that we were caring for. So I've been the pay-or of this as well. On the pharma and medical device side, I've done both clinical and bench research. That's expensive to do. It's potentially very rewarding in terms of great cures. It's also potential for vast profits, which is a sore that cuts both ways, I think. We have to be careful about that. I had a nuclear medicine company for a while. We've used and distributed at EISOS, possible trauma-emitting, tomography type, and so on. Then we have the government side of this. And our job is to bring clarity to everyone's roles, responsibilities, and the rewards that they can expect. Oh, we do it in a debt, right? That's so good, I dare say. Yeah. So let's look at some of the principles that about government involvement in reform of health care. We start with a favorite topic everybody's got today. That's telemedicine. This is a big topic. It's got a great promise to leverage the essence that are in short supply and that are poorly distributed around the country. Everybody wants health. Everybody wants telemedicine. So who's holding up the train? Well remember those lawyers we mentioned that are back at the table? They have this idea. They want the liability, the medical liability, to follow the patient, to run, if you will, with the patient. But states govern medical liability laws, which they should, that's constitutional law. So the simple answer is under the federal interstate commerce laws that we simply pass a law that says that the liability, the medical liability, runs with the state, where the doctor is practicing, where he is licensed, not where the patient is. Working against the lawyers here in Congress has always been kind of an upto battle. You know, there's like, that's time I looked 112 lawyers in Congress. There's about 14 doctors. So proud number. I think though if we established a fundamental rule that the states control where the state of licensure of the medical practice, if we established that rule, the states can move forward with the rules that govern telemedicine. And we need some rules, we need some guard grounds. I think it will be very, very popular, what's set up. On a doctor patient relationship, I had met a little bit old school about this. We were taught medical school, but medicine is a calling. It's a vocation, a sacred relationship between the sick and the healer. That we're supposed to do our level best for every man, woman, and child that comes under our care. And we feel that relationship is undermined by fail first protocols, step therapies, pre-approval of every diagnostic therapeutic test or procedure and prescriptions. And now I would say that the payers and lawyers kind of get together and say without those protocols, it gets cost prohibitive. But the problem is the costs are okay. They are paid to everybody, they're paid to the patients and the doctors, and frankly, even the insurers do to some extent. I mean, so I could deliberate attempt to obfuscate what the costs of things are. I can't, I believe we absolutely must have, can have, and must have price transparency. I think we can let doctors and patients and employers make their own value judgments. There's no other product or service in the world that is so mysteriously priced as medicine. And I assure you doctors really don't know the typical costs of the procedures, the x-rays, the drugs that they prescribe. And they can't know that because of the wide variations. I'm going to give you two illustrations on that. The first is CT scan. What's it cost all up to do a CT scan for a patient? That's all the overhead, the technician fees, maintenance, yada, everything. What's it cost? Well, I had over a dozen CT scanners in my practice, and I would make money on scans for $1,000 or even a little less all day long. That was a profitable price for a CT scanner. I had a CT scan last year in a hospital, and it was $8,000. That's what the insurer paid the hospital. That's not the billing charge. That's what was actually paid to the hospital. That's a bad value. That's not the way it should work. I assure you, if my insurer hadn't known where they could get that for $1,000, they'd send me there, I think. Another example, drug cleavage, which is a good drug for a number of leukemias. When it first came out, it's about 42,000 a month. Is it slipped down to overtime? We got there about 30,000 now that it's a generic drug. The average cost across America is about $8,000 to $12,000 a month. That's for 400 milligrams once a day. This morning I went online and I priced that drug through two of the generic suppliers. One of them is good RX. Most of you know about it. So one month's supply was $113.94. I went through the cost plus drugs.com site. That's Mark Cuban's new generic medicine site I heard you guys pay attention to that because it's interesting. The cost per month, $47.10 to cents. That's versus an average generic cost in America, $80,000 to $12,000 a month. Ladies and gentlemen, I submit to you that we are headed for price transparency. We can do this and there's a big wish for it. People are going to insist on this. They're not going to pay those kind of prices anymore. We're also working very hard at the government level to repatriate our supply chains. We've all talked about our dependence on China. We know it's toxic. We know we've got to get away from this. It's across all industries. The first one we focused on is pharmaceuticals. The government did in the CARES Act and rescued at put billions of dollars into API active pharmaceutical breeding plants and generic drugs. That is happening now. We incentivize, manufacture, and America and in the free world. We realize that America doesn't have the wherewithal to manufacture and distribute all of our drugs, but we want to have reliable sources of drugs in the free world. That is to say among our allies, we can trust you, not a little rug out from underneath this. We can't do it alone. They're just aren't enough scientists and engineers in America to hold us. This is actually a focus of NATO. I sit on the parliament of NATO and I can tell you that we sit around and talk about pharmaceutical supply chains and the importance of that to national security of the NATO alliance. And by the way, many other things as well, everybody's first focus. I feel we're making headway there. Finally, I guess I want to say that I think something we need to do is to restore faith in public health. One of the casualties of this pandemic, certainly we had a lot of casualties. The death toll is now estimated at 15 million people worldwide and millions more will have long-term sequelae. But perhaps the most lasting threat is the loss of faith in our public health systems. And that occurred by poor messaging and an unwillingness to change the message when the information changed. I think people can trust. They'll trust if you say, hey, we've got new information. We have new advice. We really didn't do that. So we ended up pushing some untrue messaging. And that really undermines a lot of people's faith in government. A lockdowns that we pursued, nobody I know has shown any evidence that they actually had any benefit on the disease. And they crushed economies around the world. The estimated damage to the free world's economies, please notice, I'm just dealing with the free world here, is 100 trillion with a T, trillion dollars. You know, our children, our great grandchildren, will be suffering from this damage economically. So we simply cannot do this again. We have to face it. We have to face that with each other. I think we need transparent and honest, old leadership and medicine. And I think we have to be humble enough to admit when we've made an error and changed course. So those are sort of the major things that I think right now are on our plate there. We obviously have a lot of smaller laws. We're nibbling at the edges of. We have a very divided Congress right now. It's very thinly divided. And so you can only take little bites around the edges, but I'd like to think that we can reach some consensus and make some bold leadership changes. Dr. Smith has asked me to leave some time for comments and questions. And by the way, I'm happy to have your comments and your ideas. So you don't have to just ask questions. You can tell me what you think. And Dr. Smith, I'll turn that over again. Well, that's fantastic. What a great start. So we'll just make sure that people in the audience know that in a moment we're going to be going to questions so that we can take Congressmen up on his offer so that you can have a chance to ask a question. Dr. Smith, maybe just me, but you're breaking up a little bit. You're breaking up on your microphone. OK, I'll speak a little closer. Is that better? I hope so. So I'm wondering if we could maybe talk a little bit about some of the mental health issues. The integration of mental health and physical health has become an issue for sure. This is an issue that you have spoken of. I noticed a tweet during mental health awareness week. You tweeted, I thought this was terrific. We want to remind you that you are enough. You are valid. You are strong. You are kind. What a terrific tweet during mental health awareness week. I wonder if you can speak a little bit more about that. I know after Hurricane Michael, that was a big issue in your area among school children and others. And veterans health also is a place where that comes into play. You say a little bit about that? Yes. So mental health is a lot of static. Yeah, we're not hearing static here. So I'm sorry that it's on your end. OK, let me just go ahead. So the mental health, I think the principal damage we could during the pandemic was to kid. You know, our kids desperately need to have more confidence in the genetic confidence from the air from their teachers, from the people who lead them during their life. And they saw a lot of fear, a lot of uncertainty. And that really left the kids doing poorly and actually reflected in the attempted suicide and suicide levels and driving these levels that are showing up in the emergency room. We really know fully need to pay more attention to our kids. Now the adult suicide went up as well, but only fraction as much like 5 or 6% versus 50% for kids. This is a dramatic rise. I want even Father to talk about the drug problems with fentanyl. Fettanyl is the number one cause of death for Americans, age 18 to 45. That means if you're playing with drugs, then you never know if the drug is a waste fentanyl or a risk to life. So, the mental health is a big deal. We think we can leverage telehealth in the mental health field, but we really need to get off our art here and start moving that out to the states where they could make a difference. There are issues around veterans health. You have a tendle air force base there in your district. I know we have a place on Panama City Beach and we see the aircraft flying close by while we're there. But veterans health has been a focus of yours. Can you say a little bit about that? Yes, I was formerly the chair of Veterans Health Subcommittee. Yeah, and obviously veteran myself has been a long time in and multi-generation veteran families. Very close to my heart, veterans health issues. They're much more closely akin to the PTSD and the traumatic brain injury type problems. War is rough and we deserve to help each other with these issues. I think we can, honestly, I think we have some very, very good ways to address all of those problems. I think that we're beginning to codify that in the VA system. We made a lot of headway with that when I was on that program and I know we will continue to do that. There are really good structural ways to address PTSD and depression and veterans. One of the best things I'll have to say is I'm Vietnam was my era. It was tough to come home and not be liked. We treat our veterans a lot better now that we used to. The BHB proud. I have one more question and then if you can raise your hand out there and they'll bring a mic to you so the congressman can hear your question as you ask it. Congressman, you serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee which is the key committee for Medicare and Medicaid. You're on the health subcommittee on that. Can you tell us a little bit about the key issues that are before the Energy and Commerce Committee and the health subcommittee as they relate to Medicare and Medicaid? That's a great question. Back to when I jump off this conference I'm going into a committee meeting to mark up a series of health care bills in E&C. I think you find they're interesting. They are the ones we nibble around the sides so we're looking at things about rear-embracement issues and the servicing issues or medical defices and some things that actually we'd have to call it nibbling around the edges of medicine rather than the old changes we'd like to see. You make your headway where you can when you're in the committee. You have to do things that you can get 218 votes for and getting 218 to get counting to 218 turns out to be kind of a tricky thing to do here at Congress. But I think it'd be pleased with the bipartisan array of bills. We'll probably talk about a 17 bills today and I expect fully 15 of them to get out of the committee. Very good. Who has a question here? It's a little hard for me to see in the lights. Who has the first question? I see it. Okay. Congressman, thank you for joining us. I'm actually one of your constituents from the Panhandle. So thank you for being here. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the end of the public health emergency. So we had a major deadline pass this week where we thought we might get 60 days notice that the public health emergency was ending which has major implications for Medicaid continuous coverage. So do you have any thoughts or are you hearing anything about how long we think the public health emergency might continue past July? So we try to take that. Go ahead. No, go ahead, Congressman. So we try to take it up to days, no matter if fact, and we couldn't get consensus on it. Obviously, we'd like to be that. I think need that kind of surety. I mean, people can't plan no business and can plan if he has shifting sands under his feet. That goes for hospitals and clinics as well. So we would really like to make that kind of forward looking plan available there. But we seem to get stuck on what we call the Christmas tree phenomena where people keep hanging ornaments on the bill, ways itself down, and you can't get across the finish line. But I think that'll come. I think that'll come just not today. Okay. Thank you. Who has the next question here? Is there another question? While someone's gaining the courage to raise their hand, I must say, Congressman, you know, I come from a quicker tradition. I'm perfectly comfortable with the silence in the room. So we'll, we'll, so is there a question here I have one? So I'm wondering if you could look into the future, Congressman Dunn. You know, we have an election coming up. What are the issues that are going to be most important in the next Congress? So I think I think people feel most right now is economic. That's the personal pain they feel. But everybody has always been looking at healthcare coverage. You know, that's a perennial subject. We thought we were going to take care of that when I came up here six years ago. And we came, well, pretty close, we thought. But we did, we obviously didn't make the consensus. So it's a harder thing than you think to find consensus on healthcare. Shouldn't be, shouldn't be because we all want good things for the patients. I think what we do is we just agree about, you know, who's going to actually do those things. If we get price transparency and that's where we're working towards, everybody can make better value judgments. And I really think that that's a key, key, key element moving forward because we can have affordable good healthcare and we can do it with the market based system. But we have to be able to see the prices. And then we also have to be able to measure the value in transparent ways. But we can do that. I think the harder thing is the prices. Nobody, I mean, how many doctors out there, how they actually know what a CT scan cost, almost none, almost none. And yet we all want to do CT scans because we need. So price transparency is a huge step forward. You know, when we talk about prices, a lot of people think first of the cost of prescription drugs. What can be done maybe from the federal level, maybe from the state level to address the cost of prescription drugs that I'm really excited that you see a way to do this is the generic drugs. So let's be honest, because we moved about 80% of prescriptions to generic drugs now. And that was a huge savings across the country. CMS they've untold amount of money on that. Now if we can take the generic drugs and make those prices transparent, then I think we do very well. I mentioned earlier the cost plus drugs dot com, which is a new effort. It's been put out by this guy Mark Cuban who owns the basketball team. So controversy, right? But he committed to acquiring or manufacturing drugs and charging 15% over what he cost. Just simple. And he's just opened this up. I've been working with the CEO of that company very, very impressed with how they brought the price of generic drugs down from where they were. So I would tell you across the board that the cost of their drugs runs about 10 to 15% of the typical generic cost. So it's not just generic, it's generic now at a good value. All of a sudden that's value price and that's transparency. It's a brand new effort. I think others are going to join in behind that. I think it's going to be a great thing for the cost of medicine America. You still have the brand new innovative drugs. They're very expensive. They're expensive to develop. Maybe we could streamline the FDA process a little bit to help that cost come back down. But that's an inherently very expensive project, which is why it's difficult to find a lot of these innovative drugs in other countries around the world. They simply will not pay that money to have those drugs available in other first world countries. So probably 40% of the drugs that are available in America are not available in Europe simply because of the cost of these new innovative biologics and things like that. So one of the expensive drugs that is recently developed and on the market is the Alzheimer drug. Do you have any thoughts about that and its availability and the FDA approval process for that drug? So the Alzheimer drug market is an interesting market. It's a busy market. There are probably 30 or 40 drugs that are under investigation, probably four or five that are close to approval. One that has gotten across the finish line with FDA approval, but the approval was frankly because it was handled in a way that was very not unnormal. So I mean, it went beyond was a committee of scientists who looked at the drug and it was 12 members of the committee. 11 voted against approving the drug, one abstained and the FDA director approved the drug. So you have this drug that has a kind of a tainted history as it goes through the approval process. And so in response, when CMS, this is the people who actually buy the drug now, right, typically we always think that if the drug is approved by FDA, CMS is going to pay for it. That's the kind of rule of thumb. It's not a rule of law, it's a rule of thumb. So then CMS says, well, okay, we're going to pay for this drug only if you join an experiment and have 100% reporting on your use of the drug and adverse reactions, et cetera. So they actually created another experimental model. Now that's not what CMS is designed to do. CMS is designed to pay for drugs and distribute drugs. FDA is the one that's supposed to approve drugs. So we confused the issue enormously by the process that the FDA used on this drug. I would hope that in the future, what we do is we see the FDA give conditional approval rather than CMS say conditional coverage of a drug. And so, you know, as you help suffered from it, what was, I would argue a poorly thought out process in government in the FDA, honestly. And that that taints the process. They should be able to say, okay, it's approved, it's not approved, or it's conditionally approved. And under these conditions, because they raised a lot of hopes for people who, you know, if you have a family member with Alzheimer's, you know how sad and difficult this is. But that's not the only condition to treat it. And also treated down syndrome, treated traumatic brain injury. I mean, there's a lot of things out there that we sort of snatch the rug out from underneath those people. That does not let confidence in the government's public health efforts. So one of the proposals which seems to be gaining some momentum is for Medicare to be able to negotiate drug prices. That's something that's not ever happened before. What would you comment on that proposal? Well, so the easiest area, you know, Medicare actually sets the price on these new medicines. So that's something that's negotiated between CMS and the company that's innovating the drug on the front end. And that's a process that was fairly complex and nuanced in and of itself. But the idea is they look at what is it saving and what cost has the company come up with. The real promise for negotiating drugs with CMS is when they go to the market and negotiate for generic drugs. If 80% of the drugs that CMS are paying for are generic drugs, all they have to do is find a good reliable source of generic drugs with good substrates, right, making good high quality medicine and then make a deal with them. And I would argue that those prices are coming down, tummoing down rapidly right now. So that's where you want CMS to really start saving money. And they can. They can save a lot of money. So did we have a question here? We have a comment here, but we need to have a microphone right over here. And here's the microphone. Yes, go ahead. Thank you, Dr. Smith. Congressman, an honor to have you here today. And thank you for inviting us to make comments and not just questions. My name is Jennifer Sweet. I'm the CEO of Etna Better Health of Florida. We are a Medicaid managed care plan. My comment is to thank you, first of all, for starting your discussion today about the crisis and mental health. And I want to point out that our data completely supports the headlines in a most alarming way. We have, for example, 50% of our behavioral, critical behavioral diagnoses falling to children between the age of five and 13. And of those, 27% aligned to suicide ideation. This is a crisis. We have a hard time reaching these members and helping them. We have a dearth of providers available to help them. We have not enough funding, for example, to support programs where we could deliver services in schools. And so my comment to you would be to please take that knowledge forward as you go to committee meetings and talk about Medicaid and the potential opportunities to really think about the headlines as children in distress. And there are very real things we can do. We are all standing by to help you with ideas and programs and anything we can to support getting help to these children. Thank you. Thank you very much, Jennifer. And you actually said something that I think is key. What do you engage kids the most in the answer to schools? I mean, that's where we get almost all of them, you know, five days a week. We've got to get them in the school and then we've got to also engage them there at the school. It's the logical place where we can engage these kids because they do have suicidal ideation. It's at an all time high. And you know, we just have to go to where the kids are, I think, to reach out to them. And I don't know the right program yet, but I'm pretty darn sure that's where we're going to find those kids. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Jennifer. Thank you, Congressman. That is such an important issue. We'll be talking about that later today. Another question. Do we have another hand? Hello. Hello. My name is Mario Gonzalez. And Congressman Dunne, thank you so very much for being here with us this morning. I work for Aqua Germanology and represent not only the Germanologists in terms of provider groups and physicians, but having been in health care for quite some time. There's a lot of provider groups across a lot of specialties that struggle with this. And I know that you had mentioned reimbursement as being on main topic. And obviously, expansion into Medicaid is one of the things that the physicians constantly struggle with and obviously on the reimbursement side. Certainly the state acknowledged that several years ago as they brought Medicaid for pediatric patients up to parity, up to 100% of Medicare. And I'm wondering from a federal level, is there any initiatives that are occurring that would bring Medicare parity for Medicaid recipients from a reimbursement standpoint? So that's a mixture of state and federal law there. Let me say that the federal law we have, we've been living for decades now under this sustainable growth formula that's, you know, is out of date. We've pretended that the medicine can be budget neutral and not increase any pay. At the same time, we've looked at inflation for everything else across the economy. So I know that the doctors, you know this too. You said you've been into this for years. You know, the used to be doctors went out and they worked for themselves or for their patients, if you will. The patients paid them, the insurance companies paid them directly. Now 76% of American doctors are working for somebody else, an employer or a hospital system, a clinic, somebody else is paying them, not the patients. So they're, you know, they're dissociated from that pay. And it's a reason it's very simple. Can't make a living. Can't make a living. So only the people, only the systems that actually have a large enough captured population to negotiate income reimbursement can actually make a living doing that. Every kid coming out of Ike should say, get every doctor coming out of residency today is going to go to a hospital or a really large clinical practice, one of these, and a lot often, at least partly owned by private equity, somebody who can, who can make deals for them. We have to have a fair reimbursement for it. Or you're never going to have doctors that are going to be working for their patients. And that was a patient doctor relationship I mentioned earlier, you know, it's important that the doctors actually feel like the patient is the most important thing in the relationship and there are well-being. And if we're taking orders from somebody on what we can do, what we can't do in every single minute situation, I'm not sure you're arriving at the right answers for them, but in fact, I'm sure we're not. So I think we need to update or jump the sustainable growth formula. You know, realize that inflation has hit medicine as well as everything else. And let's start to re-examining what we're paying. We have to save money in medicine, but I don't think saving money by driving doctors into the arms of employers is a good way to do that. I think we can address it on the pharmaceutical side. I think we can address it on a lot of diagnostic sides. I mentioned my CAT scan. What does that make sense? Value value as cost transparency. Thank you. I think we have time for another question. I mean, just one, because I have a 10 o'clock committee meeting. Exactly. And we do as well. Is there one last question? Let me finish with this, Congressman. What else would you say to us about the key issues in health care now? Cost seems to rise to the top quality, access, value. Where would you put all of those and where should we be going into the future? Let's finish with that. So that, you know, that is a balance. Right. The value, the cost, and you know, you don't be easy to spend all the money in the world on every single patient up, but you can't do that, right? You can give a good value based equation, but you know the best way to do that has always been let the patients make their own value judgments. And they can't do that if they can't see the price. Now, the other thing I need to see is an honest assessment of how good their care is. And you know, we do that with advertising and reputation and most of it by word of mouth. We count on most, so I was a specialist, right? What do I count on? I count on the opinions of the primary care doctors as to am I a good specialist. And you know, if I don't impress my colleagues with my quality of care, then they're not going to send their patients to me. And that's always been the system we relied on. I think it was a pretty good system. Now if we have patients who are captive in systems, they can only go in that's inside of a system. And I appreciate it when a doctor tells me, hey, listen, I could do your knee, but I'm not as good at your knee as this fellow over here is doing knees. Why don't you go see him? I think that's a great doctor, he's honest. I like that. And of course we do subspecialize. And that subspecialization makes people better at it. And that's true across the board. Pediatric mental health is different than adult mental health. There's different than veteran mental health. So I'd like to see, I'd like to see as a return to a little more professional referral program and actually pay people for what they're worth. That is a terrific place for us to finish up today. First, we can't tell you how much we thank you for being with us today. You're so generous with your time and we really appreciate you taking the time to share with us today. So thank you. Let's get around to applause to Congressman Dr. Neal Duh. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Appreciate you. God bless you. Thank you.",

You guys, this is a historic day, and I could not be more proud to stand here with you all today, but the millions of Americans who are fighting every single day to protect the lives of those most vulnerable, the unborn. You guys, this moment is one that we need to recognize as a turning point in our country. Can we get an amen? Yes. I am standing here today. The youngest Republican woman in Congress, a fighter for the unborn. Because quite frankly, 33 years ago, my mom was faced with an impossible, seemingly impossible decision. The doctors told her after she had endured a debilitating stroke at the age of 27 that she would never, never be able to survive child birth again. And most certainly, the child would not survive. So years went by, and when my mom found herself pregnant, alone, scared, and with no one to stand behind her, not even her own family, with doctors telling her that she would not survive, that the child would not survive, and that abortion was the only choice. My mom, against all odds, she made the bravest decision of all. She chose life. And so today, I am here because of a very brave woman who decided that life was worth protecting, that God had a plan, not just for her, but for her unborn daughter. And she was able to deliver a healthy baby girl. And so today, I stand here, someone who was never destined to be in Congress, someone who was never destined to take my first breath. And it's in large part because of the work that every single one of you have done to support and really fight for that critical, most basic tenant that our country is built upon, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But we all know that today, we are fighting for who we are as a people and as Americans. And it begins with life. Thank you to every single one of you for being here. Thank you for fighting for all the little girls and all the rights that they deserve as Americans in the womb and today is the turning point. We will persevere. We will succeed. We will overcome. And we will overturn Roe V. Wade. Right? Thank you so much. Thank you for empowering women. Thank you for being here. And God bless.",

        "transcript": " Hello Jacksonville. Oh, y'all look good in red. Yes, but come on, we're going to have to get pretty hyped up because guess what? We've got Mike Waltz, Matt Gates, and the best governor in the union, Rhonda Santis. Come on. Yes, my name is Cat Camack, and I am your Republican nominee for Florida's third congressional district. Home to the Gator Nation. Any Gator fans in here? You know, yesterday I had the opportunity to sit with President Trump, and he leaned over to me and he said, cat, how are we looking in Florida? And I said, Mr. President, tomorrow night, Jacksonville is going to show you just how good you're looking in Florida. And I'm sitting in the Oval Office and thinking, oh my goodness, what an honor. I'm just a regular person. See, I grew up the daughter of a single mother. I grew up on a cattle ranch, and I grew up wanting to take over my family's small business, but big government got in the way. And in 2011, they took our cattle ranch. Yeah, let them know what you think about that. That he does. Because you know Obama and his cronies, they like to tell lies all the time. Remember this one? If you like your doctor, you can write? So we lost our cattle ranch because of their lies and big government. And now today, because of President Donald J. Trump, I am sitting here 32 years old, the youngest Congresswoman in the GOP in the country, homeless to the House of Representatives in less than 10 years. Homeless to the House of Representatives in 10 years, because only in America is that possible. And only if we elect Donald J. Trump, more freedom, more opportunity, more prosperity, only in America under Donald J. Trump. Am I right? And I feel a particular sense of duty in getting the young women out to vote for President Trump. Where am I ladies at? Yes. I see you guys. And they tell me all the time, conservative struggle with women. Women don't like Donald Trump. Ladies? Is that true? I didn't think so. And they told me that if you're a college educated woman that you need to devote for Hillary Clinton, unbelievable, right? Yes. But as the first in my family to go to college, a graduate of the United States Naval War College, go Navy. I told them I would have had to have been dead to vote for Hillary Clinton. And in that case, I would have voted twice. And also the wife of a first responder. My husband is a firefighter and a SWAT medic and he's sitting right there. And so it just really gets to me when I see these antifa people and these liberal radicals calling to defund the police. It's never going to happen. It's never going to happen because when you have a president like Donald J. Trump, we are not only going to defend the police. We're going to fully fund them and we're going to always have their back. Back to blue. Am I right? So I have an ask for you guys. We've got 40 days, 40 days to save America. And it's going to take every single one of us calling our friends, talking to our neighbors, getting out the vote because this election is so much bigger than us. This election is about right versus wrong. This is about America versus socialism. This is about equal opportunity versus equal outcome. And I know which side of that fence y'all are going to be on. So now we're here tonight. We're celebrating president Trump. We're getting out the vote. We're getting fired up. We are going to stage the greatest comeback that the world has ever seen. But we need your help. We're going to make facts matter again because the fake news, it sure doesn't right? That's right. So again, November 3rd, every single person here, we need you to give everything that you've got for the next 40 days. Give us the next 40 days and president Trump will give you everything he's got for the next four years. Because we need him for how many more years? Four more years, right? And so I am asking you guys, take this energy, take this momentum from today. We've got a great lineup of speakers coming up. And as I said to president Trump in the Oval Office yesterday, Mr. President, tomorrow Jacksonville is going to give you a taste of just how good you're doing in Florida. So let's show him. Come on guys. Make some noise for Donald J. Trump. My name is Kat Hammack and I'm proud to represent the Gator Nation. Thank you guys for being here and let's go get him. Thank you. Please welcome our next speaker, Congressman Matt Gates.",

        "transcript": " Tonight is the annual Congressional baseball game and climate change activists are preparing to protest this family-friendly event. Yeah, terrific. One activist writing an op-ed in the Washington Post saying, quote, \"'As the world burns, Congress appears ready to remain perfectly hitless on climate change and as if playing games with the atmosphere weren't enough, these same members of Congress now want to play a literal game of baseball in July 28th as if everything were fine.'\" I thought they were contentious, gluing themselves to the Mona Lisa. Koli Shimkis is at the National's Ballpark for the Congressional baseball game. Congressman Rod Williams and Congresswoman Kat Kamiq are there with you, Koli, to get their reactions to all this controversy and fun. Yeah, that's absolutely right. We're playing baseball later. You too are, but there's also a lot of news to get to because of these protests. A congressman, you've been on the team since 2012. Have you ever known the Congressional baseball game a charity event to be protested? No, I don't understand. It is charity to chance to forget party political lines and give to charity. We're looking at $1.7 million a charity night. That's a no-brainer and why people want to go in and challenge that and take away from the greatness of that is beyond me. $1.7 million to $35 different local charities, which is great. And it's a bipartisan event. Congresswoman, a lot of these protesters say that they are exercising their peaceful right to protest, which is fine. Others say that they're willing to get arrested to shut down the game entirely. What do you think about that? Well, it's kind of like Coach Williams here said. Nothing says you care, like shutting down a charity game, right? Especially one that is for kids and children's charities. But, you know, I've noticed the posters. They're fliring all over the city. And again, nothing says that you care about the environment, like throwing paper all over the city. So, I think it's just looking for attention and it's going to be fine. We're going to have a great night and there's a lot of people. It's a sold out game. We're excited. Well, I see the trophy in the background here. Is it here because the Republicans won last year? It's here because we won last year. We're going to take it home tonight and we're going to keep it till we see you next year. So how's the team looking? We look really good. You know, we won last year, Carly, but we're betting we were last year. Really? They worked hard and I'm proud of them. We've been practicing since March. Our first practice, we had snow. There's actually a major committed snow at 5.30 in the morning. I thought that's how much we're being a lawmaker is taxing enough. Why add this on? Because we care. It's fun, right? Yeah. 5.30 to 7 every morning. I'm proud of everybody. 5.30 to 7. So, when you get up before 5.30, you turn on Fox and friends first, right? And then you watch Fox and friends when you come back and practice naturally. Why did you want to join the team? Last year was your first year on the team, right? That's the question I ask you too. That's what I ask myself. Why did I want to join the team? No, it's fantastic to one, build these relationships that camaraderie with your colleagues. It is truly the best way to build relationships. And this entire congressional experience is all about relationships. Plus, when you're playing for a guy like Roger Williams, who is so passionate about it, and it's just infectious. It's hard not to get excited about the game. Will you play professional baseball at one point, right? Yeah, played in Atlanta, Braze organization, Cleveland Indians. That's awesome. Baseball is a big part of mine. You're bringing your talents to Washington, DC and teaching the masses. You tried to teach me one year. How to swing a bat. You didn't go over too well. Maybe you weren't going to work on fielding. Yeah, I don't know about that either. I thought that your career was going to end right then and there. You quit trying to teach me. Is there any camaraderie between the Republican team and the Democrat team? Whether it is. We've got a lot of friends on each team. We have fun, you know, neatly in each other and so forth. Manager Doyle, who's the manager of the Democrats and our good buddies, we have fun making fun of each other. But at the end of the day, we're back to one thing. Charity, helping kids, helping those that need to be. Yeah, it's a really great example of bipartisanship. And guys, you heard it here. They're very confident that this trophy right behind it. I hope you can see it. I don't know if you can, but if you're right here, can I touch it? Can I bring it over? You can't drink out of it. Don't you? Oh, it is. It's heavier than I expected. You're confident that it's staying with the Republican team. Are you guys confident, too? The whole team is behind the camera. That's beautiful. Looks like a cap of it. I'm loving what you're doing this morning, Farley. Karly, you're always having a Congresswoman and a Congressman on and they're always dressed in their uniforms. This is like the third hit I've seen where you're doing this. Isn't it great? Yes. And, Karly, do you have time to ask them in their preferred pronouns? Oh, Brian wants to know your preferred pronouns. It's a tricky... Skip. We have a skip herd of patron. I like that. I did not know that was a pronoun, but that's good. All right. It is now. We can make up all the rules. Karly and the congressman and woman, thank you very much for joining us live from Nationals Park there in Navy Yard.",

        "transcript": " All right, let's bring in Florida Republican Congresswoman, Kat Chemack. Kat, great to see you. Now, before we even go to the broader story here, I know that you have a very personal story. And I just want to kind of let you share that to kind of frame our discussion. Absolutely, good to see you Katrina and Bob. And yes, this is a personal issue to me on so many levels, starting with the fact that I'm not even supposed to be here. My mom, she was urged to abort me because I was a high risk pregnancy. When she was 27 years old, pregnant with my older sister, she suffered a stroke. And it took her about a year, year and a half to learn how to walk again, basic motor skills. And it was then that the doctor has told her that she would never be able to have children safely again, because it would certainly be dangerous for her, even life threatening, and a child certainly wouldn't make it to term. So when she found herself pregnant with me years later, the doctors immediately told her to abort me second opinions of doctors told her she needed to abort me, including her own family. My grandparents urged her to do the same. And it was a heartbreaking moment in her life, but she against all odds, against all that pressure, she chose life. And she carried me to term and delivered a healthy baby girl. And I'm here today because of my mom's courage in order to make that very, very personal life changing decision for herself. But she thought that it was so important to protect her baby girl. And it was truly God's intervention in that moment. So for me, looking ahead, looking now is the voice of the generation of millennials in Congress, but millennials and Gen Zs all across this country. This is really truly the issue of our lifetime. This is a human rights issue. This is about a women's empowerment issue. Being pro-life is the party of science. It is the party, it is the movement of the human rights movement. And really, this is going to be a defining moment that we see here as the final ruling comes out because we will be the post-row generation as well. And just to finish up, your narrative, your story, you're married to a first responder. I forget how many kids you have, but I met one of them. She's really smart. So that's what has come in your Congress woman, which is just an extraordinary story. Give us a feel for what Florida politics are like when it comes to this issue, because it's known as a swing state. It's been more conservative lately. But I'm kind of curious where people are standing on this and what conversations you're having with people. Because I don't make it like it's cut and dried in Florida especially. You know, it's definitely becoming more of a conservative state Florida is. And of course, we had our amazing governor, Rhonda Santos, just signed into law the 15-week abortion ban. And I think that this is long overdue because we now know that science is catching up to what we've known all along that life begins at conception and that viability in that question and concern of viability, it is certainly at 15 weeks if not sooner. And that is when you really start to get into this conversation about not just viability but consent. And when I talk to people on the ground back home throughout the state, they all are very, very deeply rooted in their own belief system. Some folks believe that this is very much a woman's issue where she should be able to terminate the child up until the day of delivery. Because they don't see that child as a child. They see it as something that is within that woman's womb and that that woman has complete autonomy over that independent, that child. However, the thing that I continually push back with is that is a separate heartbeat. That is two heartbeat sets the mother, that is the child, that is two sets of DU DNA, unique DNA. It is a completely separate issue than what the left has been parroting since 1973. They are talking, they're same old talking points. And when you push back with the issue of, hey, viability is absolutely happening at 15 weeks. We've seen this, science is catching up. And they say, well, you know, maybe that's one of the things. I fire back with my Archie Sik and tired of the hypocrisy of government. How is it that they could possibly classify bacteria on Mars' life? But they're not going to classify that child with a functioning brain and a heartbeat in the womb as life. Yeah, on that, I'm sorry to interrupt there, but I did want to continue that discussion on viability, keeping it in Florida. Republican Senator Rick Scott, of course, from Florida, pendant new piece, urging those on the left, on the left to answer the question in this headline, quote, Democrats, when do you think life begins? His piece goes on to argue, quote, when do Democrats believe life begins? A conception at viability, at birth, after birth, they won't say, even more disconcerting, reporters won't ask them. It's a dereliction of duty by the mainstream media not to push the question. And it's an abdication of their responsibility to inform the American public and spur legitimate debate. Your take on that, I mean, it kind of seems. The question is, would they even be able to agree on an answer to that question? You know, I really don't think so, because what we've seen from the left is that they want to avoid having a diversity of opinion, a diversity of thought. They're all about diversity when that narrative fits their own agenda. But when it comes to actually dealing with the facts and sciences on our side in the pro-life movement on this, when it comes to dealing with the facts, they don't want to discuss it. They immediately turn nasty. They start trying to yell over you and shout you down. And that's why we're seeing this very dangerous environment surrounding the Supreme Court justices. You have a generation of people who've been given a participation award their entire life, and they think that they can bully their way into a ruling that they really have no idea what they're talking about. Not the Supreme Court justices, but these protesters. Roe v. Wade is simply returning this issue back to the States where he's rightfully belonged for so long. They don't understand that. I can't imagine how foolish someone must feel protesting an issue that they quite frankly don't understand. All right. Thank you so much. Congresswoman Kamik for being with us. Always a pleasure talking to you. Thanks, Bob.",

The COVID pandemic has put our country and our communities to the test, pushing us to seek the positivity and hope in each day, as we have weathered the storms that have come our way. I want to highlight the great work and service of my constituents who have shown bravery and empathy in these trying times. Last week, I invited the constituents of Florida's third congressional district, the Gator Nation, to submit their nominations for individuals they would like to honor for their dedication to our communities over the last year. I received several nominations with the names of constituents who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to put service above self. So many nominations, in fact, that we have pledged to continue this series throughout the year to highlight their great work. Included in this group, our first responders, law enforcement officers, teachers, nurses, and good Samaritans, they are the backbone of our communities. And I am honored to be able to represent them in Congress and share their stories with you today. First, my friend and the only woman sheriff in the great state of Florida, Sheriff Michelle Cook. Sheriff Cook, in her long tenure in law enforcement, has walked the beat and fought against the scourge of the opioid, empathemic, and human trafficking in Clay County. She's also the proud mother to four foster children who she lovingly brought into her own home to prevent their separation. She works every day to protect our community and our great county of Clay County. I am so grateful for her service. Thank you, Sheriff Cook. Now much like Sheriff Cook. Sergeant Kim Miller. Sergeant Kim Miller has put service above self as a member of the Green Cove Springs Police Department. While Sergeant Miller celebrated her retirement earlier this year, she has spent the last 15 years of her life dedicated to the children of Clay County and their safety and development. She is proud to have been the first black female sergeant for the Green Cove Springs Police Department and continues to make the citizens of Clay County proud. It was always a pleasure seeing Sergeant Miller smiling face when I visited the department and I congratulate her on her retirement this year. And although she isn't on the force any longer, her service to the Green Cove Springs community is remarkable and I am honored to celebrate her here today. At this time, I would like to yield to my friend, the gentleman from the great state of Alabama, Mr. Carl, for as much time as he may consume. I appreciate that. Mr. Speaker, what an honor to get to speak before you. This is the thrill. But I do. I rise. I rise today to honor several hometown heroes from my district and to make that have made an impact on the community over the course of the year. First, I'd like to thank my colleague from Florida, Congresswoman Kett Carmack. I know I missed pronounced that cat. We all call you Kett. I've organized a special order to honor. I also reached out to my community and I asked for the leaders in our community to give us some of what they think to be hometown heroes. So let me just run through a few real quick. Last year has been tough on millions of Americans across the country as we battle COVID pandemic and endure countless hardships. But I'm proud of so many folks in South Alabama who have made our community a better place. Many of them are unsung heroes. So I'd like to take a moment today to honor a few of them. Ryan Coates, a manufacturer instructor for the City of Chickasaw School System is a leader in the effort of developing inexpensive prosthetic limbs that will change many lives of amputees throughout Latin America. Students from all disciplines have been working together to create a real nonprofit business that eventually these students will travel to Latin America not only to fit the amputees but also aid the amputees and rehabilitation as they learn to walk and use their new limbs. Another one Natalie Fox, assistant administrator and chief nurse officer for USA Physical Position Group at USA stands for University of South Alabama which were very proud of and the USA Healthcare has been a leading coordinator in the University of South Alabama Healthcare System community texts testing and vaccination sites for mobile region. Today she has overseen successfully implementation of over 26,000 COVID 19 vaccines administered since December the 15th and over 50,000 COVID tests performed since the pandemic began. Natalie has worked tireless to meet the high demands on the healthcare system for the past year and is incredibly and I'm incredibly thankful for her hard work her dedication to the people of South Alabama. Jennifer Myrick of Fair Hope Alabama has been a critical figure in the recovery efforts after Hurricane Sally and Zeta which hit the area. Jennifer worked through the Fair Hope United Methodist Church to set up an independent point of distribution to hand out critical supplies to the public. She's also headed up a feeding program for those supplies and an active member of the volunteer organization active in disaster through mobile ball and county emergency management. It's an outful Mr. Speaker where she helpful fill many needs throughout the county. Jennifer also worked with the Fair Hope Police Department to keep police officers, dispatchers and correction officers fed through this long stretch between both of these hurricanes. Kathy Kui, a recreation supervisor for the city of Chickasaw, Alabama goes above and beyond her duties every day and her day to day responsibilities to make sure the city is a better and healthier place for families to live. Her creativity is limitless and she has a true with a true servant heart with so many people working and learning from home over the past year, staying active and getting out and has been a critical to the people's physical and mental health. Kathy's hard work has made Chickasaw a better place to live and raise a family. Virtually no person across the country has not been impacted in some way by the pandemic, natural disasters and the countless other challenges that we have faced. We have come a long way. Although we are living in difficult times, I could not be more prouder than I am to be in American today. I would be more thankful for so many incredible people over my district and all over the nation who have worked hard each day, not for fame, not for recognition or for money, but for the betterment of their friends and their neighbors. This is what makes America strong. I am grateful for the opportunity to take a moment today to recognize just a few of those unsung heroes that have made an impact in our community over the past year. I yield my time back. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you to the gentlemen from Alabama. Even though on Game Day, the SEC nation, we may be rivals. We may be rivals on Game Day, but when it comes to honoring our hometown here as we are united and I appreciate you taking the time to share these stories. Before I yield to another one of my great colleagues, I want to highlight a great man, Mr. Mike Leiter, from Fleming Island, Florida, who is an active duty physician proudly serving in the United States Navy. Mike was deployed in April of 2020 to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and has been working tirelessly to save lives over the last year. His wife Adrian and his three children have remained strong and positive during his time away from home, recognizing his sacrifice for our fellow Americans. Mike is set to be deployed again next month to once again take up the fight against this pandemic and he and his family will be in my thoughts and prayers as he continues the fight to end COVID-19. I would also like to honor Orange Park Native Peggy French. Miss French is what her nominators call an angel to seniors. Miss French spends hours every single week scheduling vaccines for seniors in Clay County. She has become somewhat of an expert in the process and even helps to monitor the vaccine sites for cancellations to help seniors struggling to get appointments. To date, she has helped over 60 senior citizens get appointments for the COVID-19 vaccine in her spare time. I visited the COVID vaccination sites in my district a few weeks ago where these very seniors that she helped were being vaccinated. And I just want to thank Peggy and those just like her for helping folks in our area. And at this time, I would like to yield to my very good friend, the General Lady from the great state of Oklahoma, Miss Bice, for as much time as she may consume. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the General Lady for yielding. First, I'd like to thank Representative Kimek for bringing this idea of honoring our hometown heroes to the floor. It is long overdue. There are so many who have made an impact in our communities over the last year. When I think of the countless hours our healthcare workers have dedicated their time spent away from family to take care of others, the doctors, nurses, and first responders. We can never fully thank them for their dedication to our country during this difficult time. But as my team and I discussed who from Oklahoma's fifth district has helped this community survive the pandemic, who worked on the ground with people in need. One name was mentioned over and over. And that was Pastor Derek Scoby of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Oklahoma City. He and his band of volunteers have worked countless hours to make sure Oklahoma's everywhere were fed, not just in the surrounding community, but in towns and cities across the great state of Oklahoma. In partnership with the World Vision Organization, Pastor Scoby distributed more than 91,000 boxes of fresh food in the past year. That is 2.3 million pounds of food hand delivered by Ebenezer Baptist Church and his countless volunteers throughout the state. My team and I have the pleasure of assisting Pastor Scoby with a few of his distribution events in Oklahoma City. I was overwhelmed with gratitude on the faces of those who were receiving these food boxes. This man right here is truly making a difference to those in need. He's been on the ground day in and day out, making sure that more than 150,000 Oklahoma's did not go hungry during this pandemic. In addition to food, he made sure that those needing furnishings did not go without. His group distributed 2300 pallets of furniture to the under deserved as well. It's a monumental task that Pastor Scoby took on, but he saw the need in his community. Heard from pastors and communities from across the state with similar needs. Rolled up his sleeves and he got to work. This nation needs more pastors like Derek Scoby, who aren't afraid of the hard work of feeding our communities, not just with the word of God on Sunday morning. Both hours of heavy lifting, sweating in the heat of the summer, or trying to stay warm in the sub-zero temperatures, all to make sure those who are hungry have something to eat. So thank you Pastor Scoby for being a hero to Oklahoma's from every corner of the great state of Oklahoma. Thank you and I yield back. Thank you to the gentle lady from the great state of Oklahoma. It has been an honor so far serving with you in this Congress. And I expect that we will be hearing many more stories of great Oklahoma's that are doing incredible work in our communities. At this time, I would like to honor a gentleman who is much like my husband, a hero, and firefighter. Justin Dean serves the Orange Park Fire Department and it's city, both in his capacity as a firefighter and as a heroic private citizen. Mr. Dean was driving home one afternoon recently when he noticed a car parked on the side of the bridge near Drs. Lake. He pulled his vehicle over, proceeded to talk to the woman standing atop the bridge and offered her a hug. And when she accepted, firefighter Dean jumped into action and pulled her tightly over the rail to safely. Safety. He was awarded a meritorious award for his brave, life-saving action. Thank you Justin. Ronda Wilson is a hero from my hometown of Gainesville, Florida. She wears many hats in our community. She is a middle school teacher, a Thespian, a theater director, and a philanthropist. She founded the Star Center Theater nearly two decades ago and in the years since has provided an opportunity for local children and families to perform and enjoy fine arts. A portion of all of the theater's proceeds go to created Gainesville, a nonprofit committed to reaching and restoring women caught in sex trafficking and sexual exploitation in Gainesville. Ronda's work is especially impactful to me as I have worked to eliminate human trafficking from our district and our state. And at this time, I would like to yield to my good friend, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Donald, for as much time as he may consume. Mr. Speaker, thank you so much for the time allotted and I want to thank the gentle lady from Florida, my good friend, Congresswoman Kamek for bringing this great idea to the House Chamber to honor those of us in our communities who have done, frankly, more than members of Congress actually have. The sacrifice that they've had not only in our communities, but it do out their lives is really something to honor. It's something to behold, it's something to cherish. And I'm just grateful for this opportunity to do this on the people's floor this evening. The first home time hero I wish to honor is Captain Wayne Ogden Smith. Today we pay tribute to one of Naples hometown heroes. Mr. Smith is a United States Air Force fighter pilot in a Vietnam prisoner of war. Captain Smith was a prisoner of war at the Hanoi Hilton for five years alongside Senator Sam Johnson and Senator John McCain. However, he would never call himself a hometown hero. Wayne was a 1965 graduate of the United States Air Force Academy and would fly 90 F-4 fighter combat missions over North Vietnam and Laos. Captain Smith was shot down on January 18, 1968 at the age of 24. He survived five years and two months and was repatriated on March 15, 1973. Wayne's combat honors included two silver stars, the Legion of Merit, two distinguished flying crosses, two bronze V-stars, seven air metals, and the purple hearts. Now retired from the business world, Wayne Smith spends his time with his wife helping veterans and active military around the country through organizations like Reefs across America and Naples Spirit of 45. A celebration honoring our World War II veterans and beyond. Another hometown hero from my district, Mr. Speaker, is Allison Dawson. Allison has probably dedicated her life to educating our youth. Allison's career in youth education spans over 30 years, almost 20 of those in Lee County, Florida. A single mom who raised three kids, who struggled to pay bills and struggled to put food on the table. Despite these obstacles, Allison remained committed to her passion and her life's work, teaching and helping low-income students learn and grow to succeed. During COVID-19, like thousands of teachers across our nation, she juggled virtual school and in-person instruction flawlessly. All to ensure her students received the very best education. She is a prime example of how hard all teachers across America work every single day. I am honored to recognize Allison Dawson today as a teacher and as a public servant. I thank you, Allison, for your 30 years of service, your commitment to serving others, and ensuring that every child, no matter their race, gender and socio-economic background, has access to a world-class education. Mr. Speaker, my last hometown hero is Major Jose Martinez, BSN and RN. Jose Martinez, RN and BSN, is the nursing director of Adult and Pediatric Emergency Department at North Naples Hospital in Southwest, Florida. He has been a nurse for 22 years, 13 of them at NCH. Major Jose Martinez has a 19-year military career. He has served nine years with the Army National Guard and ten years with the Air Force Reserve. Major Martinez is currently a flight nurse instructor and clinical management flight commander in the 45th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron, McDill Air Force Base in Florida. Major Martinez just returned from a six-month deployment at duty station, Travis Air Force Base in California. Major Martinez coordinated more than 50 Aeromedical Evacuation Westpac Cross Country Aeromedical Missions with more than 400 Aeromedical Evacuation Crew, critical care crew and neonatal critical care members serving more than 100 patients that represent our U.S. military and their families. He has dedicated his life to serving others and has served countless lives. I am honored to recognize Major Martinez today and his sacrifices for our nation. Mr. Speaker, there are many heroes in all of our communities. These are just three that happen to live in my congressional district and it is my honor to honor them this evening. And with that, I yield back to the gentle lady from Florida, Miss Camich. Thank you, Mr. Donalds. I look forward to, as a fellow Floridian, getting to know your hometown heroes at some point in the near future. And thank you for joining me here tonight on the floor of the People's House to honor hometown heroes that make up the great state of Florida. And last, but certainly not least, I would like to recognize my friend and the great sheriff of Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods. I have known Billy for nearly a decade and in that time I have seen his passion for helping people. I am proud to have worked with Sheriff Woods on combating human trafficking in the state of Florida, as well as taking on criminal drug traffickers and supporting the rights of lawful gun owners. I am also proud to recognize his tireless efforts tonight to protect and serve our ever growing community in Marion County. I know Billy to be a man of integrity, grit and honesty. He is a tremendous defender of freedom and security. And I am proud to call him and his wife Samantha dear friends. I am deeply grateful for all of the people who have spoken here today. Their work and the efforts to make up my district and its many communities a better place to live and raise a family do not go unnoticed. They make me proud to be an American and the representative from Florida's third congressional district. I chose to celebrate these hometown heroes today to honor their work and celebrate their passion for helping others. I challenge my constituents and all Americans to take stock of everyday heroes all around us and thank them for what they do. Whether it is working as a frontline health care worker in a local clinic, a law enforcement officer, supporting children, librarians assisting students with virtual learning or delivery worker ensuring that we all get our critical packages on time. They are all and there are so many more out there extraordinary Americans who continue to put duty above all else. Thank you to the nominees and the nominators of today's heroes. Again, I look forward to continuing this year long series of honoring our hometown heroes and I look forward to hearing more of my colleague stories from their hometown heroes. At this time, I would like to thank you, Mr. Speaker for allowing us the time here tonight to honor these heroes and with that, I yield back.",

That's what I like to hear, and that is that exact attitude that we need for the next 17 days. Am I right? Exactly. I am CatCamac. I am the representative from Florida's third congressional district. The Gator Nation. And I know I'm in dog country. I know I'm in bulldog country, and you're probably wondering what in the hell is a Florida Gator doing in Georgia besides the fact that we're in the SEC Championship. My body bird is back here. He's a hurricane. So it's mixed company today. But I'm telling you, I'm here today because Georgia matters. It matters so much that y'all got a Florida Gator in red and black. That's how much it matters y'all. And we've got a fantastic lineup. David said it. The Calvary is here. He's got all these incredible people behind me, but a good friend of mine, Senator Ted Cruz. And I know that y'all want to hear from him, so I'm going to keep it short. But I just wanted to share a little bit about my story with y'all. So you have some additional ammunition and know that you've got friends all over this country. See, politics wasn't in my plan. I'm the daughter of a single mother. A third generation commercial sandblaster. I am the wife of a firefighter and a swap medic. Do we have any first responders here? Yeah. I'm here. Thank you. Thank you. Give it up for our first responders, y'all. And exactly nine years ago, I found myself homeless because of an old man. Obama era housing program. Obama and his cronies took our cattle ranch away. And now, Biden and his cronies, they want to put all those terrible policies back in place that made millions of people, my family included homeless. Are we going to let them do that? That's what I like to hear. Y'all are fired up. And you know what? When I come downstairs, first thing in the morning, you know what the first thing I see is my husband's swap vest on our kitchen table. And you know what Biden wants to do? And you know what Warlock wants to do? And awesome. He wants to take that very same vest off. My husband's back and defund the police. Are we going to let them do that? Hell no, we're not going to let them defund the police. And so I haven't asked for you because this is personal. This is deeply personal. These people are coming after us, our families, our communities, our way of life and our country. And I'll be damned if they're going to do that. Am I right? So my ask to you all today, 17 days, 17 days to give it everything that you've got, every one of us here today, we're believers, but it is going to require every person that we know, every friend, every family member, every coworker, call, text, drive them to the polls, make a plan, everything that you've got for the next 17 days. And then we will have our country back. But it's going to take every single one of us getting uncomfortable and making that sacrifice. So please, join me for the next 17 days, noctores, make phone calls, text, email, everything that you possibly can so we can save Georgia, we can save the Senate, and we can save these United States. Are you with me? Thank you, Georgia. Let's do this. Georgia, let's do this.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Madam Speaker. You'll three minutes to the General Lady from Florida, Miss Camille. General, ladies, recognize for three minutes. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I came here today to speak on behalf of women and the parents of my district. Heck honestly, I came to speak on behalf of all Americans who want their kids to be safe and secure in their schools and for people to be safe in their communities. I came here today to say that we all want these things because our hearts collectively break when any life is lost. We mourn for those lives lost needlessly. We need to do better and we can do better, which is why every single member of this chamber must without hesitation denounce, decline and decide and oppose against HR 7910, the politics over our kids act. This is common sense. Taking legal firearms out of the hands of law abiding citizens does nothing but empower criminals. It's already illegal to commit murder. Has that stopped murder? Has that stopped violence? No. Madam Speaker, you said in your opening remarks that, quote, protecting our kids, what could be more important than that? You said, quote, we are here for the children. You went on to say that, quote, everything we do is for the children and that today's effort to strip our constitutional rights is, quote, a crusade for children. You must have forgotten the nearly 60 million children that have been murdered through some of the most horrific means during an abortion, all on your watch. You invoke JFK and say that our children are our best resource and our best hope for the future. Is that so? Why do you deny them their future by killing them in the womb? Sounds a bit hypocritical if you ask me. And you also made the statement that the leading cause of death for children is firearms. Then why does the data refute that? NBC News reported that motor vehicle deaths of kids from age 1 to 17 continues to be the number one cause of death. Spare me, Madam Speaker, that you are here fighting for the children because your three decades in Congress reflect a record of anything but a fight for children. Certainly not the kids being trafficked at the border, not the kids being abused, not the kids fighting for their life in the womb or the kids whose future is being stolen by abusive big government policies. If this were about protecting kids, then why does this bill do nothing to secure our hard in our schools? Why was there no bipartisan efforts as part of this package? Why do these bills do nothing to address the mental health crisis that we are facing driving the violence? It is the guns. It is not the guns. It is the people. People who are intent on committing acts of evil and violence will do so by any means necessary. That is a fact. But while you have conveniently forgotten so much, I certainly do not want to forget how many victims of domestic violence will be left without options to protect themselves if this garbage bill becomes law. Because it is the same party screaming to defund our police is the same party screaming about how you, a law abiding citizen should not be able to defend yourself. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention that you have clearly all forgotten your oath. An oath that we took here on this chamber floor to uphold and defend the United States Constitution. The second amendment is a part of that. Madam Speaker, into all my colleagues, the Constitution is not all a cart. You can either accept it all or none of it. But you cannot tear him to get fired. And if you can't uphold your oath then you should resign with that I get back.",

        "transcript": " Hello. Welcome to the Billy Wilder Theatre. I'm Claudia Bester. I'm the Director of Public Programs and I'm very pleased to welcome you to this afternoon's talk by Greg Bordewitz. Here to introduce our guest speaker is Johanna Burton. Johanna is the Keith Haring Director and Curator of Education and Public Engagement at the New Museum in New York. She's also the co-curator of the Hammer's Exhibition. Take it or leave it. Burton has curated or co-curated a number of exhibitions including Sherri Levine Mayhem at the Whitney Museum in 2011. And she's written essays and edited books on artists like Cindy Sherman, Mel Bachner, Cytwombley and Marilyn Minter. So please join me in welcoming Johanna Burton. Thank you all very much for being here. And it's my great honor and privilege to introduce a figure that has long been a part of my life even before I met him. I'm going to give three versions of this introduction. The first is Greg Bordewitz is a Leo who likes to sky dive. Second part is not true. I learned this this morning. The formal introduction for Greg Bordewitz is, Greg Bordewitz is an artist and writer. He is the program director of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago's Low Residency MFA Program and a long time faculty member for the Whitney Independent Study Program. Recent performance-based work includes testing some beliefs, an improvisational lecture, presented in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and Texas, sex mitigating death on discourse and drives, a meditative poem performed at the Tate Modern in 2011. And the history of sexuality volume one by Michelle Foucault and Opera presented in Vienna in 2010. Books that have been produced by Greg Bordewitz include General Idea, Image Virus, published in 2010 from After All Books and the AIDS Crisis is Ridiculous in Other Writing's 1986 to 2003, published in 2004 by MIT Press. And for those of you who know the very formidable part of his practice devoted to film and video, fast trip long drop from 1993, a cloud in trousers 1995, the suicide 1996 and habit 2001. Now here's a more personal introduction. Greg Bordewitz is an artist, theorist, poet, activist, teacher and friend. He is a critic and an advocate, a producer of experimental new forms of engagement in a guardian of history, a tough loving caretaker and a crafter of counter narratives. Radical change, Bordewitz has stated, is a matter of altering the entire culture's view of reality. That is no small order for considering arts place within society and the possibility that what and how we operate within art has such effect was in large part what drew me to participate in art at all. It has been an honor to know Greg over the years. Like many of the artists and take it or leave it, Greg has been a mentor and an inspiration, not only to those of us lucky enough to know him personally, but also for many more, who in their quest to locate ways to think outside, various conservative or limiting frameworks have stumbled onto or into his practice. As I said, I knew Greg's work well before I ever met him. Through the work he and his friends and lovers had engaged in as the AIDS crisis reached an unthinkable magnitude, which remained unacknowledged by the government first as existing at all and later as health and ideological crises demanding its support. Via his wide-ranging individual artistic practice and early collaborative activist platforms, including ActUp and Diva TV, Bordewitz's history of enacting the ways in which art can not only operate politically and passionately, but passionately, made his presence at the opening of this exhibition obvious and more deeply grateful to have him here. His commitment to sustaining the challenge to an expansion of what Marx critical practice continues to keep debates about the role of art within culture alive. I met Greg when I attended the Whitney Independent Study Program, a context that also introduced me to almost every artist in this show, who literally paved my way for thinking. I offer this introduction as a thank you and an acknowledgement of Greg's ever-generous, mostly optimistic, but also darkly realistic, life's work. You have truly changed the landscape, Greg. Today, in his keynote address for Take It Or Leave It, Greg will present materialist geography in the Night's Move. This is obviously a title that borrows Herm Viktor Schloffsky's formalist interpretation of conventions of art within Soviet culture of the 1920s. And I look forward to hearing what you have to say, Greg. After the talk has been given, we are going to be open for about 20 minutes to Q&A, so we'll open it up as soon as he's done. So with that, welcome to Greg Bordewitz. Hello. Thank you very much, Johanna, for that very warm introduction. And thank you to Johanna and Anne for inviting me to give this talk today about issues of institutional critique and appropriation and I'm going to go at it from a number of directions. I want to thank you all for coming to hear the talk. All right. All right. I want to start by putting two or three figures in your mind rather than starting with quotes, but rather, I don't know what to call them, images or problems. The first is the problem of the many-selfed person. The many-selfed person. This has been theorized by quite a number of theorists, but I haven't minded this moment, a psychoanalytic theorist who I admire. Very much Steven Mitchell, who wrote a book called, Can Love Be Saved? And actually, the many-selfed person is central to his work, but that book is not about that. But there is this passage in the book about Mitchell and his associates going to social events and walking through the social events and after which the Mitchell's associates said to him, you were a different person with each person you talked to at the event. And so he actually sat down with his associates and then they worked out. There's an amazing kind of like three, four-page passage about what it means to be a many-selfed person and how identity and character is something that coerizes between people that actually you co-produce it. There's a third term, always guiding or somehow not only guaranteeing the veracity and credibility of the exchange, but also shaping the exchange or encounter between two or more people. And Mitchell arrived at this notion of the many-selfed person as actually a model that was not pathologized in any way in terms of multiple personality disorder or anything like that. That's not what he was talking about at all. He was actually talking about the fact that identity is something we produce in the moment from moment to moment in each encounter from one to many, many to many, and between two. So that's one notion or figure I would like to put in your head. The other one is drawn from William James. William James said that the mind is a many-sided polyhedron that actually is turned to rest or pushed to rest on different facets by profound experiences. I like this figure because nothing substantially changes about the substance of the mind, but rather only its orientation as it's pushed through a profound experience to come to rest on a different facet or plane of its shape. That's the second figure, like to you to keep in mind. The third is the notion of world creation, which originates in each person's development is staged as a set of relations among the baby or developing young individual and its caretakers. I'm specifically thinking of the figure of the two and three-bodied person or subject, which is something we get from the great psychoanalytic thinker and clinician, DW Winnecock. As soon as I say Winnecock, I immediately think of much of Mary Kelly's work and the way she has documented this process of staging. I'm thinking about post-potering documents, but other works as well. Those are the three figures. The many-self subjects, the many-sided mind and the two and three-bodied figure of the human psyche. These are the three figures I arrive with because this show presented a great challenge to me in terms of the problem of how to show up. I'm really glad to be here, and I want to show up. I really have this question about how to show up for you. I don't even know who you are since you are in some ways, in many ways, a fantasy, although many of you are dear friends. You as a collective body that I address at this moment is a fantasy. I didn't know who you would be, so I didn't know who to show up as. On Wednesday in New York, I gave a reading at the Poetry Project and I showed up as the poet, writer, great board of wits. This show has me thinking about the institutional critique and my involvement with the development of that term and practice in the early 80s with a group, a small group of friends and close associates who I'm going to talk about. A much larger group of people who were great influences on us, like I could name so many people in the show, like Mary Kelly or Barbara Krueger or Louise Lawler, Martha Rolston. There's so many people in the show, I should just name the list of the show basically, of all the people who were not in my immediate peer group when I was 22 or so in New York in the 80s. Also I can just show up as a person who was there. There being a very narrow slice of New York in 1982 when I first arrived from the boroughs to Manhattan. And then it was a big deal. You were a bridge in tunnel, right? Which doesn't really mean so much anymore. Not you personally, I don't mean to offend anyone. I was bridge in tunnel and spent a fair amount of effort hiding that. I could also show up as a survivor or a relic. I'm also, it's not no big secret, I'm a person with AIDS, queer man, and living with AIDS for over 20 years. And so I'm often asked to show up and talk about AIDS and the significance of the epidemic, both within the United States and as an international crisis. Most, if not all of my work actually is about AIDS, or has been for well over 20 years. And that carries with it a particular set of burdens. That means that I have to perform and don't take that word in its negative connotations, but this is a performance in a way. It means that I have to, in some ways, carry the burden of performing the notion of their survivor who carries history and bears witness as an ethical responsibility, which is actually, in some ways, something that I take on and take very seriously. And we'll talk about all of these things somehow or juggle them. So I don't know, I'll leap it to you to, I'll figure it out. Actually, it's not, I don't want to burden you with that task, but I'll figure out how I showed up by the end of this. Or maybe not. It's already begun, by the way. The problem of identity actually is a good way in to talking about much of the work upstairs. This excellent show, which I am privileged to be able to speak about. The problem of identity and post-humanist concerns are at the center of much of the work that we're considering and discussing today and in the show. There were two forces, more, many more, but for the sake of brevity and our consideration today, let's consider that there were two things going on in the late 70s and early 80s that I experienced in my own life. On the one hand, there was the necessity of enfranchisement coming out, adopting an identity as a game and being part of a community, which is what that meant to me. Though my life and sexuality is much more complex than can be described in that particular term. And at the same time, there was the desire to have no identity. In fact, in the early 80s, before I became an AIDS activist and joined a movement, became a member of ACT UP in the later 80s, I was committed to having no identity. I was on a punk, which I guess was an identity. You can't escape it. In the East Village, doing drugs, having sex, and having fun with my friends, and thinking about what it meant to be an artist in the early 80s. And it actually came from a very formalist approach. I was an abstract painter. That's how I started out being an artist. And I'm going to talk about that a bit. But there was also this undercurrent of refusing. So there were two things I wanted to actually also put into motion. I'm just going to, it's like spinning plates is what I'm doing. I'm just setting a lot of different things into motion. And one of them is this conundrum about the burden of having an identity and the necessity of having an identity for the purposes of enfranchisements, which you experienced if you were gay or a woman or a person of color or subaltern in some way or subjugated in some way. That side of or on the margins of what was represented as the norm. And at the same time, there was this feeling that we're not really essentially these things. We knew we had passed through, now I'm going to laugh since we was talking about we. And I should actually say who is we. And I'm just referring to the people who were immediately around me at that time. We were aware both at the level of theory and also the level of lived practice that we were constructing ourselves. I embraced this notion of the dandy, which is a time-honored modernist, or actually is a modern rather notion of self-construction. And a lot of the work upstairs rides this tension between forces that you could say are external to the body or social or historically determining. And also currents of thought which recognize the notions of some essential claims of who you are. We're no longer a valid or there was no guarantee that they actually existed beyond your own self-construction and social determination by how you were situated within society. And that in many ways explains my interest in materialist geography. Actually, materialist geography, I should have been more truthful. I should have said a historical materialist geography. By that I mean Marxist geography. My first published essay was about Andrea Frazier's performance as a docent, name-ging, castle-ton at the Damage Goods Show, which was at the New Museum and the New Museum was on Broadway. And both, Andrea and I, let me start now and shift into a kind of personal anecdotal mode. There were two people who were central to my life when I was 22, 21, 22. It was Andrea Frazier and Mark Dianne. And we were constantly arguing about art. And there were a lot of other people around. But the three of us as well as Tom Burr and a few other people who were not necessarily in the show were in Craig Owens' art and ideas class at the school of visual arts. And that was an amazing experience because it was that moment for me and the two others that I just mentioned as well as quite a number of other people. Then we first became acquainted with the notion of the critique of institutions and began to formulate notions of the institutional critique and our own ideas about how we were going to proceed with that. The necessity for it was driven by a feeling that the art world was completely consonant with the national politics of the government. Ronald Reagan was in office and many of you will remember how devastating that felt to many of us. Some of you won't remember that. I know there's probably people in this audience who were born 15, 20 years later. That was for me and for many others, devastating news, not news, and a devastating event. Because it really did mean the end of or felt like it meant the end of liberation movements and the rise of the more majority and the right wing in this country as well as amped up the fear of nuclear war which was huge and urgent concern. And actually still should be because the idea that a nuclear device won't explode in the next 10 years is actually highly unrealistic or rather there's a strong probability that it will. But there was the Cold War and Ronald Reagan represented the Cold War. And so there was this fear of real fear of nuclear war that was structuring our relationship to art. And we saw the art world and neo-expressionism as the return to the masculine painterly gesture within the art world as consistent with the macho straight politics of the Reagan administration and the threats that that administration posed to the gains of feminism and lesbian and gay liberation and civil rights. And we passionately wanted to be artists. We still believed in art. And so it became necessary to figure out a way based on previous models. Like I said, we weren't operating in a vacuum. We had people who were around in New York artists who we admire tremendously and there were artists within the immediate history of the past 20 years previous to 1982 who were usually influential. And Daniel Beran was particularly influential on my thinking when I was thinking about mapping how to map the gallery. And the problem of mapping the gallery entailed the problem of Marxist geography. And that was something I shared with Andrea Frazier as a concern and was something I put into an essay that I wrote called Geography Notes, which was published in a magazine called Real Life in 1986 actually. But it was based on a few years of thinking through these problems, going through art school and abandoning painting for video which I'll talk about. But in Geography Notes, the chief preoccupation that Andrea Frazier and I shared at the time concerned the notion of materialist geography. We thought that relations among people and things were spatial and that space itself was a capitalist product. Blending Marxism with psychoanalytic theory, the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan, Frazier's practice charted the course of the body's movement through the museum's space. A minefield of associations not necessarily tied to the reference or objects in the exhibition. I'm actually reading from the note I attached to this essay and it's publication of my collected essays in which I also thank Marc Dillon who was also central to my thinking. Marc and I used to just go to galleries. We met actually in galleries. We saw each other in galleries and finally we decided we would introduce ourselves to each other and share it a great passion for ideas and art and debates around documents and documentary. But the notion of space had changed. I had not yet encountered, I don't know when it came out of Fred Jameson's notion of cognitive mapping. I picked up a book called Marxist Geography at random at St. Mark's Books by Massimo Coenny, a person, a theorist I have not followed up on. I was interested in the topic of Marxist Geography. That was the beginning of my thinking and discussion with Mike here is about what was the spatial coordinates of the gallery itself and how could we think beyond the gallery or rather tie our work in galleries to larger social formations and struggles that seem to be erased by and or actively fought against within the larger apparatus of the museum structure or what we would call the culture industry at that time. Which we understood in Frankfurt terms as being one conglomerate of including Hollywood and television and museums as a complex of in which culture had been elevated to a determining feature of the production of capital. Which is one of the definitions of postmodernism that we accepted. Times were different and they were postmodern because culture was no longer as it is in classical Marxism just the icing on the cake that has very little relevance to the production of the modes of production in the classical Marxist diagram. We understood what we were thinking about and we were reading theorists who taught us that actually culture had become a central form of manufacture and production necessary to the economy of the United States and part of its definition as quote unquote big sad ironic emoticon leader of the free world. What I mean is I don't mean that we were the leaders of the free world. The world had much to fear from the United States. We saw that our job as artists was intimately bound up with even though perhaps was not as much heavily capitalized but still intimately bound up with and connected to high and low culture and connected to television as much as it was connected to art and galleries. It's really interesting to look back at this essay you following me so far? The article works through the shows of three artists who were very important to me and were kind of people I was looking to understand how to make my own moves in the art world. The essay is primarily devoted to appreciating and trying to understand the complexity of Andrea Frazier's first dozen lectures in which Andrea specializes the museum and understands or I argue she understands that psychological associations are also themselves objects which then are produced and somehow commodified within the space of the gallery and so part of the expansion of the limits of the gallery beyond the gallery walls was this understanding which we drew from psychoanalysis that our various associations and fantasies were bound up with the intricate modes of production of culture. Intrically bound up modes of production of culture. I walk through in writing I walk through Joseph Cassute's installation at the Castelli Gallery zero and not and talk about my admiration for that work but my break with conceptual art over its topology, the issue of topology I rejected that I could be conceptual artists or I could proceed as a conceptual artist because I didn't like the way the conceptual art answered its own questions for the viewer and was still committed to an autonomous notion of art and art that was autonomous from culture. That may have bearing on culture certainly but is not directly tied to culture I could not at that time believe that principal any longer which is largely drawn from as many of you know Theodore Adorno and the Frankfurt School I could no longer accept that and I think my peers were with me on that I'm sure they were. Strangely enough I worked through and write about Martha Rossler's global taste which is in the show which was surprising to see and a delight to see because that piece was so important to me when I saw it as a young person. I'm just going to read a little bit about what I wrote about that piece when I was 22. Martha Rossler's project stems from similar theoretical conditions that shape conceptual art. However implicit in her work is a critique of the formal underpinnings that entrapped conceptual art in academia. The installation global taste of meal and three courses has colonization as its theme colonization of the self and of other countries by media and advertising. The central interlocking motifs in its three video tapes are children food commercials and learning. By the three video monitors but the three video monitors are contained within a structure that makes it impossible to get a view of all at one time. A fragmented collage of material global taste pictures the geopolitical relations that form the organizing principles of cultural production. Understanding the art world as a subsidiary of a much larger culture industry the installation cuts across a measma of cultural artifacts to make connections between the place of viewing and of you of the world. The work addresses the increasing homogenization of culture that results from the efforts of the multinational corporations which govern its manufacture. The installation is an attempt to breach the confines of the viewing condition by way of reference to the disparate forces that compose a world picture. Global taste actually really gave you know helped me to theorize this idea of the manifold many cited objects that could not be comprehended from one single perspective or point of view because the scale of what we needed to comprehend in order to produce a picture was far larger than could be comprehended from any single point of view. And that we were operating at a far larger or different scale than a previous art had been presupposing in its construction. And the essay then goes on to talk about a von Rainer's film The Man Who Invite Women in which the main character is trying to produce a collage on his wall to understand the predicament he's in the world predicament he's in and is constantly moving things around on the wall that include newspaper articles and pictures and posters from the world. And the posters for the artist call against the US intervention in Central America. And I very much identified with that subject and was interested in the notion of the viewer being viewed because of on Rainer in that film and the number of other films. And the theme of what it meant to be viewing and pictured the viewer in the act of viewing and so held open to us the possibility of contemplating what it means to be a viewer at that historical moment because she did it with such historical specificity not only at the level of what you see within the picture but also the very construction of the films themselves if you see journeys from Berlin or any of the films after that. I'm going to read the last paragraph of this essay because it has bearing on my further thoughts about materialist materialist geography in the nights move. I'm describing a phrase I've moved on and actually I'm describing a much more making much more generalized set of claims on the basis of Andre Frazier's work which has been enormously influential and on my thinking for ever since I met Andre. That's never stopped. I've always admired Andre's work tremendously and have learned a great deal from it. A pictorial activity informed by a materialist geography furthers the development of political reflection upon space and it reveals the spatial strategies of power. These strategies are analyzed in terms of how they form subjectivity or rather how they coincide with the numerous positions we occupy as social beings. Regarding signifying practices this requires an understanding of the spatial configurations of the exhibition space itself mapping the geography of this situation necessitates three terms that an anterior space be noted and drawn that means the space that precedes the entrance. That a place as defined by the limits of its area can be viewed as separate from the location it is assigned to discourse so the here and now of the work of art is no longer tied to the physical space in which it appears but rather appearance as a tie to language discourse and fantasy which far exceeds the boundaries of the gallery but the boundaries of the gallery but is no less historically determined than the very work of art you are viewing. And third that the physical boundaries of a space are not limited to perimeter of a location. I just explained that. The proposition of this article is this once the space of exhibition can be pictured in geographic terms that is in terms of geopolitical and spatial relations one can articulate the ways knowledge shapes of view of the world according to the dictates of power. This proposition was actually further confirmed for me only within the last five to seven years when I started reading the psychoanalytic theorist Andre Green who is a French psychoanalytic theorist and green added his contribution one of his many contributions to psychoanalytic theory is a historical perspective on the situation of analysis between analysts and analysts and and Green says that the analysis has to include what has happened what has not happened what could have happened what has happened to someone else but not me what could not have happened and finally to summarize all these alternatives about what has happened a statement that one would not have even dreamed of as a representation of what really happened. So this constellation this of a kind of timelessness a suspension of time the recognition that the unconscious doesn't recognize clock time is a formidable and necessary proposition to going forward with the problem of making art then and now I would argue. I'll backtrack and maybe repeat some things I said but I'll going to maybe concretize them I'm going to give a short narrative of how I ended up doing what I did which was eventually giving myself entirely over to AIDS activism and its representations via collective video making. Somewhere along the way my values changed I once held a romantic devout belief in beauty I was a painter when I moved to Manhattan I've always wanted to be an artist all my life my paintings were often shown in the cafeteria of PS1 186 later in high school I spent most of my time in the art rooms making abstract expressionist paintings I wanted to be Jackson Pollock when I attended art school I started making monochromatic paintings add Rhyne Hart all black painting became a task. I realized that I didn't enjoy the act of painting I loved the act of making meaning I started painting myself out of my pictures applying the paint on the canvas with a roller executing the task as fast as I could. I became more interested in how the object hung on the walls and I became fascinated with the walls first as surface later as architecture I went from viewing the gallery as a structure to questioning it as an institution who determined what hung on the walls and why who attended galleries and the wall. I began making videos because I needed to work at a time based medium to answer all these questions the first work was about my sexuality in the context of AIDS I became interested in AIDS as a political crisis process groups were forming video making it became a means of documenting the emerging movement. I started working collectively to make documentaries began writing and publishing critical essays and analyses of my own work. I adopted a set of aesthetic principles principles to which I was until recently committed reduce the category of beauty to efficacy the category of form to function the category of audience to community. Today I'm sitting here writing myself out of the categories I reduced myself to. That's from a piece titled Dance Moments which I wrote actually in the exact date it was around 1994 dance moments was published. So in the mid 90s by the mid 90s I was reviewing and thinking about how political pressures had led me to seriously consider exigencies that were directly affecting the lives of myself and many others I tested for positive rates of being 1988 I presume I was infected much earlier but in the mid 80s we were advising people as activists not to get tested. So we did until we won anonymity protection and laws then we were advocating for people to get tested it didn't matter if you got tested anyway because at that time there was nothing you could do. So we basically advocated that you should just have safe sex protect yourself first each one teach one and all the lessons of harm reduction that have not been carried forward. But I'm not going to talk about that or I will if you want to engage in the conversation about that. So I think I've done enough work establishing how I think you can ask me during the question period but I think that I've done enough work establishing how a materialist geography arose for me and some of my peers understanding that the work of arts is not a good thing. I couldn't fulfill its promise of being autonomous necessarily and was tied to much larger forces than were previously imagined in ways or modes of operation that were new because of technological changes pre-internet but still the rising of mass video. So I think I'm asking consumer video production equipment and the ways in which that enabled us to produce fast videos to document a demonstration during the day and actually show members of ACT UP footage of the demonstration at night and review the successor failure of our tactics. So I think that the feedback loop had existed previously. You know you can get it from the Soviets mid-Ved candidate to give air to have did it. That was our model. Gene Karlin-Musto my collaborator for six years of the game in the health crisis where I produced all of the AIDS educational audio visual work with Jean together. We had a picture of dig a very tough in our editing room. We drew a lot on the Soviets and that's where Sklovsky comes up. But Sklovsky comes up in a very strange way as Johanna said when she introduced me. I am borrowing the notion of the night's move from Victor Sklovsky who was an early 20th century Russian writer. I don't know very much about and I'm now learning about the night's move meaning KNIGHT is a chess metaphor. Many of you probably know or play chess but if you don't on the chess board the night is a piece that has a very prescribed and circumscribed kind of movement. It can move forward and back but it always has to go left or right. It can't land in a linear way so it goes to moves and then it goes right or left and it can do that back or forward. And for Sklovsky the night's move is a way of understanding art. He says in the first essay of the book the night's move which was a collection of essays that he wrote. In the early part of the 20th century that the night's move is a first and foremost a way to explain what art is. It is a moving forward in a way that appears to be linear toward an object but a veering away from that linear objective. He understands this to be constitutional and historically determining why does the night move the way the night does because it's actually what the night does and it's part of the structure and rules of the game. And within the structure and rules of the game this is the way in which this figure is permitted and this is the figure of the artist. That's one aspect. The other is that one adopts the night's move or identifies with the night as an artist if it's impossible to see your way forward. Straight ahead. And so it's interesting for me to think about this adoption of a materialist geography and the notion of the night's move which I've always used. In my own thinking about how it is I go about anything including this lecture. That L-shaped movement of going toward an objective but actually veering in a completely different direction. And I understood it in that limited way for a long time but actually for this lecture I decided that I would actually read Schlowski more closely. And I began to think about how Schlowski thought that art was apart from life in fact. Schlowski was not a modernist thinker or an avant-garde thinker. He was an avant-garde thinker. He was a futurist but he was not to not operate under the mandate as defines for us in the early 80s by scholars like Benjamin Buchlo. He did not identify with the demand to merge art with life as part of a determining defining feature of the avant-garde. He felt that art was very much separate from life. And so the night's move, Frischklofsky is not emerging with art in life. Although I often just in some kind of superficial way understood this idea of the night's move and there are far larger or far more associations that come to mind, do shops abandon mint of art for chess and the chess game itself as a figure. For John Cage and for many many other artists there are many precedents. Align in the wall text upstairs caught my eye and it's in the politics section I believe and in which the wall text explains the impulse to tie the concerns of art to those of society. And then let me think about the night's move in a very different way for which I'm grateful. I think Take It Or Leave It is a formalist exhibition of formalist proposition. And I do not in any way mean to use that term in any negative sense. I'm actually grateful for the opportunities that the exhibition provides for me to think through and rethink a set of problems that I've been twirling around in my head for now 25 years or so. By formalist exhibition or proposition I mean that most of the works of art in the exhibition and I wasn't really thinking so much about the presentation or my presentation or the other exhibition programs that are tied to this. But I was thinking specifically about the presentation of the works and the choices of who is and who is not in the show because the show could go in so many different directions if you talk about appropriation and institutional critique. I was thinking that this show is differentiated itself from a lot of the other 80s shows because it is so formalist in its approach in that the works are allowed to speak for themselves and many of the works do demonstrate political ties to social movements. I mean Adrian Piper's piece, this is not a documentation of a performance which is a picture of housing struggle or September 12th the drawings on the newspapers, Martha Rossler's Global Taste, Glenn Lygon's Condition Report, Rick Ritt the Taravan, Niege's entitled 2014, Up Against the Wall Motherfucker, Jenny Holzer, Memorandum for Condoleezer Rice, Green, Mark Dions, Killers Kills, Mary Kelly's, Mimos or Mimos, Nail and Blake's, Gun Manifesto. I was just walking around, there might be others that I left out but I was thinking that these works are validly political in that their manifest content that they present are direct representations of political struggles and or the language of political struggle or somehow tied to other movements. Mark Dions' work for me is always tied to in my mind to the ecological movements and earth first and environmental concerns. And so in that way many of the works have are tied to social conditions but what's missing and there isn't a structuring antinomy and it's interesting to note that there's a structuring antinomy that's still haunting us between what we call formalist which is what Schlosski meant by the night's move, which avoids propaganda, which avoids merging with life, which represents itself as itself as a radical alternative. So I did a structuring, which is actually what I subverged myself into. I completely gave over my practice to a direct engagement with a social movement that was organized around a militant protest, went to jail, and it gave myself over to the service of the movement. I was sitting in Kreg Owens class and I am not saying that was better or worse because I am still a tremendous amire of, say, Andreas' work or Mark's work and learn a great deal from that. But we went in three different directions. So we're sitting in Kreg Owens class and first of all you have to understand, sitting with Kreg Owens was phenomenal. Kreg Owens was just luminous, right? He was tall and lanky and he smoked cigarettes, blue done hills elegantly and wore beautiful suits and was always too tall for the small school chairs at the School of Visual Arts. We were just in rapture and Kreg was doing tremendously important work translating the first translations of Derrida, of the Paragon. Recently turned on to Marxism, he'd gone to some conference with Martha Rossler on contemporary Marxisms, they eventually made a book out of it where Fred James is presented, and Marxism was new to him. He was also wrestling with how feminism was tied to his identity as a gay man, which eventually wrote about and an essay called Outlaws. And all of these things were being juggled marvelously, extemporaneously, hilariously in frightening ways before all of us. And we owe a tremendous debt to Kreg Owens. And if you haven't read his work or you're not aware of his work, then I think she'd go out immediately and find a copy of his collected writings and read things like the allegorical figure one and two and earth words and so many essays that were so central to my thinking and the thinking of the group of people that I'm talking about. As many of you know, Kreg Owens died of AIDS in the early 90s, I believe. And there are representations of the AIDS in the show that are very, very moving but are not directly tied to the social movements or direct actions that happened previously or are continuing to happen around the world, around AIDS as a continuing global crisis. Stephen Freen is wonderful. The second sentence of everything I read is you mourning sex. This new piece, a relatively new piece, recent piece is an amazing work and very moving. And as is to see David Wanerobich's work and Felix's work, Felix Gunsala's Taurus. Those artists are fantastic artists, and they're making the nights move. And they're doing all the performing, all of the three propositions that I introduced arrived at for myself when I was 22 but are doing it in a way that is not necessarily linked to or directly engaged at a productivist level, which meant that the funding had to directly come from, that was one of the terms that I established for my productivism. I left the art world, I thought I was leaving the art world in the late 80s and would only accept money from the game and health crisis or directly from act up to produce work and the work was never sold for profit but all the money that was made by the work went directly back into those groups. And that was my position for six to eight years. It's not my position now, but it was then. So if you just take this, let's just say Andrea, Mark and me sitting in Craig Owens' room, a class room and thinking about what to do with the institutional critique. We each adopted a materialist geography to our work and internalized it as a structuring feature. And we accepted the notion of a night's move that the work could not be directly propagandistic but somehow still had to tie itself to what was going on in the social world and urgent social concerns. But the three directions are, I've always wanted to write about this profoundly different. Andrea maintained and arguably with good reason and it is one of the great levers in her work that the work of art or the autonomous work of art is something worth fighting for, which I come to find out also believe in some contradictory way. One self of me believes that, at least one self of me believes that urgently, that the autonomous work of art is something to believe in and something to say. And some other self of me thinks that art should be on the street and getting arrested, which is what I did. And then Mark did the most amazing thing. Mark took on this notion of allegory and used the form, stole the form of the Natural History Museum to stage meditations on taxonomy and organization within the fine art space. And by doing so did tie himself by association to larger issues of the environment and the world. So I've often thought about the way that the direction that we went and how we started from what from what seemed to be a single set of propositions, but arrived at practices that are actually very, very different from each other. I just want to end, I think, because I'm nearing the end of my time with talking about appropriation. One of the other things about Shklovsky's notion of the night's move is that since Shklovsky was a Russian formalist critic, he thought that all works of art were processions of procedures. And devices. And actually appropriation then could be understood in one of those procedures or devices that walks forward in this procession in the construction of the work itself. And it's interesting to me how appropriation became such a charged term for us in the 80s, if you think back to what I was talking about earlier, I think appropriation was an urgent term because of the tensions between identity politics and a post-humanist understanding of there's no there or there to identity. And we ran with the ball of appropriation because we felt that the eye is a place in a sentence and not the person speaking it. And we understood that we were constructed individuals both historically determined by forces beyond our control and through whatever little volition we could muster ourselves to defend ourselves. And or and franchise ourselves as outsiders. So appropriation was a way of stealing. We thought of it as theft. I don't know if dare burn the homeless here but I always wanted to ask her. It's apocryphal to me but I've always understood that when she made Wonder Woman that she actually had to steal the video or somehow get access to the video from the network because the warrant VCR is then. So and I've always thought of appropriation as theft. And the many the many debates around appropriation in the 80s and onward had to do with the notion of property as theft. And our legitimate claim to the culture that streamed into our houses and into our ears and was provided to us as products products that we both were discussed by but also loved like pop music for example. I mean pop music is this fantastic commercial object that a door no hated but we loved and and yet it was also something that was purchased and produced and engaged in the production of ethics which I also see as commodities emotions are commodities to we sell emotions or we buy emotions every time we download that iTunes hit at three in the morning or not even an iTunes hit but that song or just you know construct our Spotify. Account to play only those things that will produce the right effect for me it's rock music I'm just stuck in 1975 and and Brian ferry and you can just produce a world like that actually don't have to listen to anything. But we know that appropriation actually you know didn't originate in the 80s and in fact appropriation is as I inferred before is a constitutional device of language one you know eyes the perfect example that we get from Roland Barth right we all use the the first person singular plural pronoun to refer to ourselves and when I say I you know you I'm referring to me but when Johannes as I you know she's referring to herself and so in fact. So in fact this singular pronoun first person singular pronoun is something we appropriate and the names that are given to us by our parents proceed us usually in western culture and so we are a place made for us in language these are the things that were drawn from structural linguistics and semiotics that justified our notions of appropriation and our procedures of appropriation so actually has a much larger history and in fact appropriation was also a form of theft as defense because we felt that our culture was being stolen from us in fact cultural theft is the constitution of American culture white people still rock and roll from black musicians and all kind you know there was a huge land appropriations through conquest of New York. And that's a very significant difference that is the very foundation of this country and appropriation is in fact a much larger concern than simply you know quoting or borrowing an image from the dominant media it's the way in which it's the why it's a why Nietzsche hated metaphor actually Nietzsche hated metaphor because it was conquest or it's why Susan Santag hated metaphor because it was a very important thing for us. Or it's why Susan Santag hated metaphor because she felt that it was improper and mobilized all sorts of ideas about illness that were hurtful to the people who were ill. I'm not necessarily agree with these are not in fact my own position is that you just can't do away with metaphor I still accept that there are two axes of language metaphor and autonomy and you cannot but help speak in metaphor and it's adjacent concept allegory would that you could but you can't. So but we discussed appropriation intensely and we're very much interested and of course there were all kinds of debates around patent regimes and things like this and and the whole notion of patent history is only being a century old and that folk music is the ideal model of a appropriation culture because it has no there's no author and folk music can just be adopted in song and and we tooled for any purpose that's what how we were meant to do. So I'm not going to emphasize that anyway if you see inside Lu and Davis that romanticism is kind of destroyed in a good way. And we discussed appropriation in terms of three categories which were the three categories of postmodernism postmodernism meant a lot of different things there were there were postmodernisms and I'm actually it bothers me it irks me I don't know if it's just because I'm turning 50 this year or because I was heavily invested in the past. I was heavily invested in the discourse or whatever but I the wholesale. Disputation or dismissal of postmodernism gets to me because frankly postmodernism was the banner as is testified to by the show upstairs postmodernism was the banner under which women people of color and queer people were represented at far larger numbers than previously in my experience in the art world. So regardless of what you think about postmodernism and its legitimacy as either a social condition or an economic world economic condition the movement itself was more than can be summed up here but the terms around which the postmodernism was discussed was a kind of internationalism people were giddy about postmodernism because it meant internationalism was a kind of internationalism. There was a Kilebignito Oliva and other critics who championed that simply alone our response was an early response to this internationalism as a form of network society globalization that was fully instrumentalized by the super national interests of capital that would be the Marxist take on internationalism of postmodernism. When it was a postmodernism it was the Phil Johnson AT&T building it was the ability to mix and match and you saw it in Julian Schnabel's work as much as you did in any number of other people's work that could be mentioned and appropriation also meant interventionist like I said it was property as theft and we were stealing back our culture or not. It's much more complicated than that and actually appropriation is neither good nor bad. Appropriation just is now and when we look at it. There was another example I just want to throw in there I'm sorry but it's a small footnote just to think about appropriation in a different way there was a book that was very important to me written by Dennis Altman in the 70s called The Homosexualization of America and the Americanization of the homosexual. Anyone read that book? It was a great book. I don't know if it was a bestseller but a lot of my friends had it and the book was basically about how Madison Avenue had stolen all of its codes of conventions from gay culture like the Marbrow man and then that those codes of conventions which had stole for the hypnisfactor from gay culture then turned into a kind of form of domination. Whereby being homosexual men styling yourself as America whether you were in Australia or in Paris it was a resulted in a kind of a modernization which many of us later experienced is the Chelsea Focation of small neighborhoods in large capitals like the way the Mara in Paris turned into Chelsea or the traveling rainbow rings that were seen everywhere all around the world good or bad we don't have to debate it. I just wanted to say that appropriation is neither good or bad and is just very much part of the ground of our significations. I have actually been speaking for less than an hour I was told I should speak for an hour. I have five minutes to go so I'm a good boy. I can end here really because there is no resolution to the night's move. I think the show has been very challenging to me because it's and I'm grateful for the opportunity to think about these things out loud. I hope that they were somehow coherently presented in ways that we can talk about them further. I find this proposition of a formalist exhibition to be most challenging and most appropriate to the moment. It's a very important and usually significant because it does give us a unique perspective on its topics that differentiate it from the other shows, a wave of shows that are either memorializing and or trying to understand the 80s. Hi, thank you for speaking. I was wondering what the context was when you saw global taste for the first time because you spoke about it being one of your favorite pieces it seemed like and if it was different from the way it was presented in the show. It was pretty much like shock to see it was presented at the New Museum adjacent to different pieces. I don't remember what show it was in the New Museum. It was in the context of my weekly engagement with galleries like the Mark Andre and I and others used to go to seeing art all the time. I mean that's all we did was like we just ate, slept and argued art and cared very deeply about what was going on. So I can't unless you have a more specific question, I can't really describe the context more than that. I guess most specifically then, could you were you affected by the audio of the piece in some way? The thing that I carried away from the piece was it's the combination of lots of other artists have done this. Judith Barry does this marvelously with the recent more recent work that she presents in the show. You can't comprehend it from a single perspective that there are a number of things going on at once that you are provoked and required as a viewer to actually construct the piece. For yourself either alone or with others as you engage the work. There were many pieces that did that, that was the one that did it for me. It's like falling in love. Any number of people, then there's that first one. I think I have editions of you in my head. It's a Roxy Music song. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about the commodification of culture that you mentioned at the beginning of how the Marxist terms have changed. It seems to me to be so intense at the moment and very confusing. I'm sorry, I don't fully understand the question. What seems to be intense to you? The formal expressions or creative endeavors become commercialized so quickly and so part of the capitalist separatists. I think that's true, but I've talked about this with a number of friends about what does it mean to look at Louise Lawler now as opposed to when we first encountered it. I've always been for incorporation in a perverse way. I actually want, we wanted to be artists and part of being an artist is actually getting shown and having your work enter the apparatus. And Andrea has argued this way more cogently than I have. Andrea Frazier has argued this way more cogently than I have. To be an effective critical artist one has to appear as an artist and make an appearance within the art world as an artist. I reject when I kind of fastened this missiles of work that was understood to be critical and even Marxists and work that has now achieved the kind of success and has entered circulation in a different way. That's not interesting to me. What does it mean to be critical and now or how would a younger artists make use of Marxism or can it be done are questions for me, frankly. In many ways, I'll always be a socialist. The socialism is a tendency. It's not a strictly definable book of doctrine. I don't look to the Frankfurt School. In fact, as an educator, I'm very much interested in historically bounding the Frankfurt School and presenting it as past as something that was urgently felt and thought by a group of people who passed through history at a particular moment in time. But frankly, the notion of the culture industry is like a huge conspiracy theory. I don't buy it anymore. The total administration of culture, the notion of the total administration of culture and the ultimate end game of everything being instrumentalized toward the end of the production of capital is just something I've never been able to work under. It explains my choices in theorists. I was gravitated to Foucault. Foucault was optimistic. I didn't go toward end game theorists. I teach Debore as a kind of beautiful autonomous work of arts. The sight of spectacle is this incredibly beautifully written, hermetically sealed, perfect package. But it does not, in any way, explain the way to go forward. In fact, it's an impasse. So I think it's very much important to an urgent upon educators. Shout out to the educators. Some purring is an educator now. I did not teach death of the authors, although it was written two years ago. And to not teach the Frankfurt School as though it's entirely relevant without question in the present tense. Signification in general, actually. My question is totally vague. It's just something I picked up from here. I would agree with you. If you were to suggest that signification is still historically determined and bound up with the structures of economy, I would agree with you. If you were saying that it's that and only that, a fatality within that, I would have to disagree because I believe that we have a narrow but nonetheless measure of volition that cannot be controlled. I have to believe that. I mean, I think that's why authoritarian societies don't survive. That's why I think there's liberation in the pop song. That's. That. It's very important to understand the economic circumstances. I still believe that. If you understand the geographic historical coordinates of the modes of production and comprehend what it means to post be post-fortist, then you have an important explanatory tool for talking about arts. I don't think art dies. Nor do I think signification dies in the face of that. I think signification. I still believe in excess. This might be I'm old or something or older. I still believe in excess and the excess is of signification and the uncontrollable aspects of signification that make the nights move so important, necessary and urgent. Whether or not it is a validly linked to a social protest movement. What did you move? I guess maybe an LA. I don't know if you're from LA or not. Bridgerton tunnel. Downtown and New York downtown, people would testify to this for me because downtown, New York, you know, you have to come from downtown or appear to appear downtown, which meant that you were below 14th street and for me it was always in the East Village. And if somehow you just arrived and appeared, you didn't come from Queens. In other words, you didn't take a bridge or a tunnel to get there. Which meant what did it mean? It meant you were working class. My grandmother lived in Queens for 35 to 40 years. She went to Manhattan twice. When I grew up, you dressed up to cut up Manhattan. It was more expensive and it was far away and it was as far away as Hollywood and glamorous. And that's why I couldn't work hard enough to get my ass off of Long Island and get to Manhattan when I was 18. That's what it meant. On the topic, I guess I was just thinking about history and making history and versus reviewing history. Walking around the show, I was kind of dumbfounded at how colorful and fun and really felt all of that work was really sensual. It's really sensual show. And I was kind of shocked. I mean, I'm obsessed with this stuff and I think I got it wrong. I thought it was very sterile and sharp and very goal oriented and maybe more black and white, if not in intent than in form. I don't know. Maybe I guess my question is, I thought the way that history happened was at first it's an emotional thing. It's brothers fighting. And then it becomes sterile. The Civil War is on paper now. Whereas this, it almost seems reverse. We cry now at minimalism. So that these histories, why do they, I mean, why do they look so fun? Were they fun? Were they that emotional and colorful? And these things were happening, I guess? That's an interesting question. And again, the many selves want to answer it in many different ways. The first self would say that actually we, there was a lot of fun. There was a lot of influence from punk culture. And hip hop and other forms that were very fun. Mark Don and I used to go to the Roxy and see Africa Bumbata. And that was just as important or here Africa Bumbata. And that was just as important as going to the new museum on Broadway. And so there was a lot of influence, a lot of fun. And I think there was a rejection of the sterility of conceptual art. I wasn't the only ones who kind of hijack appropriate or use the strategies or devices or in schlopsky terms, procession of operations from conceptual art. But to rest it away from the sterility, academic nature and total logical self-defeating form of conceptual art as I saw it at that time. And so, yeah, there was a form that what you're picking up on is an intensity. The exhaustion of the bureaucratic pose of science that conceptual art, much conceptual art, not all conceptual art. In fact, in LA, it was a very different story. I'm talking about New York conceptual art. I'm talking about Seth Segalub's group. I'm not talking about a lot of other artists and I'm making huge reductions here. But actually, that's all I knew at the time. So I'm speaking about my own ignorance. And so, to a lot of us, to me, certainly, the sterility of conceptual art, like Katsuth's scientificism, was an urgent and important in favor of other forms. Where humor could play a role. And where the stakes were high, where fun was, you know, you had to fight for your right to party. Or you had to party for your right to fight. That was a big debate between the Beastie Boys and public enemy. And I also think that, you know, but your question also makes me think about AIDS. Like the AIDS work was some of it was hilarious. I mean, humor was so absolutely necessary. And it wasn't just only AIDS because the feminism and civil rights still had those urgency as well. And humor and fun and beauty have had their roles to play in signification regarding all of those struggles. Hi, Greg. Hi. Who is that, Kancy? It's Andrea. Hi, Andrea. Thank you so much. I don't really, and personally, but we'll talk about that later. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more specifically about the encounter between the strategies and sort of theoretical frameworks of institutional critique and appropriation and AIDS activism. And also, in some ways, specifically, in this ties into, I think, some of your reflections on the exhibition is how the notion of politics that developed in the early 80s within the frameworks of appropriation and theorization of postmodernism and institutional critique, you know, which had a longer history but was being sort of formulated more explicitly. That those notions of politics in some ways were that the activism that emerged or re-emerged in the late 80s, and I say re-emerged because of the connection to feminist activism in the 1970s and also the Black Arts movement and, you know, other grassroots political movements in the 70s. So institutional critique and appropriation and postmodernism was a kind of redefinition of the more activist politics, right, or we could say an appropriation and perhaps a night's move displacement of the activists, politics of the 70s that then kind of reappeared in some ways in very different ways in the late 80s, where those politics were again redefined. And in some ways, I think, re-emerged as a critique of the formulations of politics of the early 80s. So that's a very specific question, which is not really a question. It's an observation, but I would very much like to hear your thoughts about that encounter. Thank you. Thanks. Well, there are many selves, as you know, in there are many ways to get at that question because it's a many-sided question. I don't think everyone in act up, I know, for a fact that everyone in act up was not steeped in postmodernist theory, but there was a huge portion of us who were, Douglas Crimp, regularly attended meetings. My best friend, Rain of Auro and I, or at different junctures within the Whitney Museum study program, and read quite a lot of theory together. And there were people, there's an apocryphal story by Leigh Edelman about how every act up member carried the first volume of the history of sexuality in the back of pocket of their genes, which was not true, but almost true. So there was a large portion of us who was steeped in that theory and organized our practices according to that. And I was particularly interested in my own practice after thinking that I had given a part and then starting to show activist art in galleries. At a certain point I realized that why exclude gallery goers, they need to be educated as much about AIDS as people at community centers. So I stopped this thing with, I'm not going to show in galleries, and so I just showed anywhere I had an opportunity to and would just, you know, show a validly or manifestly didactic work. And I actually thought that you could induce a charge, I thought about it in terms of induction, that you could induce a charge in the art world through creating this direct connection to a social change movement, and that they actually, it worked both ways, that the charge would also influence and electrify the activist movement on material terms, like act up was supported by. Several large auctions by major artists that made tons of money for the group that, you know, got me at a jail, like 18 times with bail funds and things like that. But they, but there were also people who worked in Madison Avenue in act up. There was a friend of mine who, you know, was the assistant to David Hartman for Good Morning America. Actually, I actually came into act up, you know, very much under this way of D.D. Halick and Paper Tiger Television and don't watch TV, make TV, and would go to these media committee meetings. I was always in actions committee, that's where I lived in act up, and I actually was much more interested in designing how to take over the Food and Drug Administration, which we did in 1988, or how to start needle exchange, which I was part of. Those things. I was much more interested in the practical stuff in the end, but at first I tried to join the media committee because I thought that that's where I could serve as an artist. And the media committee was filled with people who worked in public relations and Madison Avenue, you know, guys who were afraid that they were sick or very lost their lovers or not only guys, women who worked for network television. And I would get into these arguments and then my friend David Corkry pulled me over who worked for Good Morning America and he said, haven't you read Grampsy? This was at an act up meeting, he pulls me over to the side and he says, you read Grampsy, right? So you know that the war of the councilor, hegemony, could be waged at the level of the popular. This is at an act up meeting. And so we were thinking very much about those concerns at a very high level, because it means it's a sign language, if you could mobilize theory jargon or not. We were thinking about those ideas, a lot of people were thinking about those ideas from a myriad of perspectives and some not having any connection to the art world. And yet the art world was so influential, every protest poster looked like a barbercougar artwork at that time. And there was a reason for that. I mean people were looking for models. And the nights move exemplified in barbercougar's work was a nights move that then was appropriated successfully as a mode of moving forward in terms of poster design. And then media design. If only to me, I don't know if we didn't know each other well. So it was only to me. I've kind of like, I don't know what's to say, what's the metaphor to use it. I'm representing myself through these layers of time. And as you know, and some other people in this room know, I was a much differently configured person and I had different ideas. I've not totally changed, but I was, I did think of my work at that time as directly critical of work that tied itself to the belief in the autonomous work of art. I did want to be a productivist. I did reject what I understood to be formalism, though I always never let go of my attachment to art and live in the art world and teach art and still make art. And that the answer to why that is personally is much more about psychology. And I think being an artist is something in the order of a sexual orientation. You know, choose it, it chooses you, I believe that. And it would be a great violence to my psychology to, and it was to, to, to declare myself not an artist. Because I care too much about this stuff. But I did at that time in the late 80s and early 90s conceive of my nights move as a critique of the very formalism which I'm celebrating now in this talk. Because I no longer think that for myself that that productive is move is the next move. I mean, I've moved, and this is classic, maybe this is just classic and cliche, but I, you know, I write and publish poetry now and completely invested in debates between conceptualism and form, neoc conceptualism and formalism, not the none of which I've touched on today. I'm not going to read you a poem today. But you know, that's, you know, after the barricades, a lot of people turn to poetry. But that's, you know, not necessarily something that I can elevate to the level of a universal claim or anything like that. I hope I answered your question. Thank you, Greg. So you're welcome. Thank you. So nice to hear you speak always. I wonder if you could share with us a broader reflection on the less, perhaps the reasons for the internal processes that led you to be perhaps more embracing a formalism or the idea of art's autonomy. And perhaps the historical or the economic conditions that are with us today that have impacted that turn for you. I think it goes back to the question that was registered earlier. That is, the art world today is not the art world of your 22 year old self, right? And the way that you understand the circumstances of where culture is or where art is or where the artist can be today. This is maybe wolf fall or, you know, my desire to hear you speak in more embracing ways of art's autonomy. But perhaps you're recognizing a certain political dimension to that desire to protect that autonomy now that you didn't when you were 22. So I'm being rather convoluted. But if you could give us a sense of how you see the field within which that desire or that dimension of yourself is coming to the fore and you're willing to embrace now that you weren't before. Thank you for that question, which was preceded by some very kind comments. Thank you again. I can't answer the question in any kind of universalizing or globalizing way or attach a kind of a plural first person pronoun to it. I'm very much thinking about the moves that I need to make. And at some point that shifted and I don't exactly know or I can't chart it. Actually, I do know quite a bit about it, but I am not going to fully detail it here. So I'm trying to select in my head what seems salient to the conversation at hand. And I guess many of the things that I'm thinking about now, which I haven't reordered the things I'm making now, are tied to the tail ends of arguments or the flip side of arguments that I'm thinking about now. And I think that the flip side of arguments that were structuring in tenemies for me. So abandoning the autonomous nature of the work of art but never giving up on politics, even at my most agit prop phase, making works following, hoping, aspiring to be like Martha Russell or Orvon Raider. And I think it was really nice like a touchstone film, not like, oh, son of a... It was like, it wasn't like anything. It was a major event in my life watching that film. And so understanding that the avant-garde was historically tied to these concerns and that those were a contestation or a problematization rather than a fixed set of concepts like the defining proposition of the avant-garde is merging art with life that is only one facet or aspect of the avant-garde that I latched onto and that seemed resonated with me in some way. It still resonates with me but I'm also very much interested in the operations of sets of procedures that are further explorations of subjectivity, the construction of subjectivity, my own subjectivity. Some of it had to do with enjoyment, one of the reasons why I started writing every day about eight or nine years ago and continued to do so and started writing and publishing poetry had to do with enjoyment. You know, it doesn't matter to me if you read the telephone book or you construct your own list of names. I'm only interested in the effects the words have bouncing off of me when I receive them. And the judgments and incorporation of judgments in viewing or receiving works of art is not an urgent concern for me anymore. I'm interested in an inventory of effects and how it resonates and the various registers upon which the work plays and how those are social registers and also bodily or embodied registers on the body, a complete rethinking of identity politics most recently via transgender theory, which completely overturned and rewrote. My understanding of identity politics or the working operation, operative assumptions of identity politics prior to it. So, in a biding interesting poetic, if you look at my work, my history is really parapetetic and the films that I make, I made a Maya Komsky film in the mid 90s. I was exosited by 1995, I was exosited by its politics, most of my friends were, we went through a period of disillusionment, our friends died, we were exosited. And then, without, completely, without expecting it, this class of drugs was invented that is now keeping me and most of my friends alive. I became reinvigorated and reinterested and ate as active as politics and made a film about distribution of generic drugs in 2001, but did so in a way that was a little bit too poetic and pissed off a lot of people in the movement. And I have been interested in writing those edges and making political films that are challenging to people who have very specific expectations of documentaries, but also can somehow be smuggled into an art world context and still be considered and valued as art, even without being gallery representation. I don't know, I cashed in my capital and the art world as an educator. I got tenure. So I understand the movements and flows of capital in the various ways that they work and those that had direct bearing on my life as well. And fundamentally, and I think you know this is, I believe that art can change the world, I still believe that. But I have done a great deal of thinking about the structure and nature of belief in the past decade. And understands that belief is a sensation that gets elevated to the status of truth through passion, not because of its guarantee in the lived world. Or any external guarantee beyond your own experience of it. And so along with many side itself beliefs come and go, you don't have a volition over that. There's some things you believe and you just can't let go of them even though they've been disproven. There are some things you used to believe and you forgot to use to believe them and someone reminds you that you did. Somehow, sometime you're confronted with a problem and all of a sudden the belief arises and you didn't even know you held it. So I'm very interested in what allows me to proceed is the understanding which you can get from the Enlightenment if you read Hume instead of Kant. That belief is a probability and never necessity and never guaranteed. Did that answer your question? That was a nice move. I can't explain why I still can't explain. I'll say one more thing and then we can just go. I was this burrow kid and every year they took us to the museums from Queens. They put us on buses and we carried brown paper, satel bags with tuna fish sandwiches to the museum of modern art, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to the Museum of Modern Art, and I was the queer kid who fell in love with this stuff. That's just never gone away. I'm grateful to the New York City public schools who no longer have art programs. Thank you very much. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Hello and welcome again to this edition of Florida Internet and Television's Phi TV. I'm your host Brad Swanson and we are coming to you from inside the Florida Capitol inside the Senate Office building. We are joined today by Senator Aaron Bean from Fernandina, Florida. Senator Bean, welcome. Brad, good morning. Just good to see you, my friend. All right. So we're in the middle of session, but before we really kind of get into some issues and things like that, we really want to know how did you get into this process? We're in the house, you're in the Senate, but what made you want to serve? You know, it started out. I served on the Fernandina Beach City Council and then became mayor and then had a crazy idea of running for an open seat in the legislature. The big turn limit change of 92 to 2000. So I came in in the class of 2000 with Marco Rubio and Jeff Atwater, Mike Herodopolis, Joe Negron and just a star-studded class. And it's a very addictive public service. It's very addicted. Right. So we've heard the story in your fights for small businesses. You had a small business. You've also worked in the healthcare space. Tell us about what in that small business world really, you know, you focused on when you really got here. Well, I'm a banker by training and technically a salesman. I went to banking school and was president of a bank and ran Nassau County, a couple banks in Nassau County for a while. All small business. But yeah, but also, I mean, worked with small business on loans. That's how I fed my family. He was making loans to small business. And we've had a handful in our family for a long time. We ran a put-put franchise for some time. We still have an auction business that we do auctions. Well, let's talk about that a little bit. So when you're selling your bills on the floor of the Senate, are you using your auction voice? Sometimes, always using my selling voice, though. And it's sometimes I get accused of being a little over-animated. What are you talking about? No one would know that about your brand. I love it. So let's talk about your work in both chambers. Because you as one of the members of the heart and soul of both chambers, you've definitely focused on health care. And certainly, you get these legislators all involved in these weight loss contests. But it's also a broader passion of yours. Tell us a little bit about that and then about your work in health care. Well, it started in the house when then speaker Bence came to me and said, you got a banker's background. Please get spending under control in health care. And that's how we got involved that way. And it's just been a passion of mine. I do some part-time work for UF Health Jacksonville. I'm a salesman for them and selling donors and selling hospital services as well. So it's a passion. We're working a bill we've worked for several years, Telemedicine, which is using technology. We definitely want to talk to you about that. But tell us about that bill while we're on it. It's a telemedicine. It's huge. We innovate and we're spending a lot in our industry in that space. But what does your bill do in telemedicine? You know, it really just defines it in statues. We don't recognize telemedicine right now. So we want to put some basic standards and definitions in law to let everybody know. Yes, see your doctor or health care provider. Because what it says is if you're licensed to do whatever in the state of Florida, your license to do it telemedically and your patient. Floridians can expect the same standard of care if they see their doctor live or see them telemedically. Right. So in our business, you know, everybody has a TV in their house. Typically, they have some sort of hookup. So our technology is going to basically be the display platform for a lot of that. So thank you for your work in that space. We'll continue to innovate. So let's move out of health care. What are your other top priorities this session? What else are you working on for your constituents? We have a variety of 26 bills that we're working right now. There's a bunch of them are in child welfare. I have three kids of my own and anything that we can do to get child welfare permanency is the key word. If we can get permanency, a kid with a family quicker, sooner they thrive. They do better. Everybody does better when that happens. We've got three to help speed up that process this year. Last year, we did what's called foster parading is a walk in the park bill where we gave everybody that's a foster care family in the state of Florida free access to our state parks. Oh, that's amazing. You know, and you think about that population of kids and making sure they're safe and secure. I mean, it's important to continue to push that policy. I imagine you're facing policy that hasn't quite caught up with the challenges of the day. So thank you for that. All right. So once you're, let me put it this way, when you're not fighting for the free world and you're not fighting for your constituents and or child welfare issues, the really important thing is is what do you do to take your mind off it? In our world, the question comes is what do you like to stream when you're trying to take your mind off of your daily work up here at the legislature? You know, that's a good question. I like a lot of mindless TV where I don't have to think and shows. I'll even watch cartoons with my kids. Me too. Okay, don't tell anybody. Let's keep that a secret between our cell. No one will find out. This is just on the internet and television. Okay. Good, good. I'm a loved to watch cable TV newscast. And this is not what you want to hear, but I like to read. Oh, no, we love reading. We love reading. Old school reading. And with books or on a nook. Our books, actual pages. We're happy to have our online connections deliver those books when you order them through Amazon and other folks. So thank you for that. So for everybody. Yeah. Well, Senator Beane, thank you very much for all the work you're doing. Not only in these ultra innovative spaces, but for Florida's children. And we know you'll continue to fight for small and large businesses across the state. So thanks for joining 5 TV. Brad, thank you. All right. That's all the time we have for today's episode of 5 TV. Make sure you hit us up at FL internet TV on our Twitter and Facebook feed. Thanks for tuning in.",

        "transcript": " A North East Florida legislator winning leadership in the state Senate. Today, we're talking with Senator Aaron Bean recently voted to be Senate President Pro Tempory. What he'll be working on next year in Tallahassee and what it means for our region. Plus, the end of the year is expected to bring an end to the City Council's investigation of the J.E.A.s failed attempt to privatize. Committee Chair Brenda Priestley-Jackson will join us to talk about the inquiry and the controversial proposed LaJay development. These conversations just ahead on this week in Jacksonville. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. I'm Tom Willes filling in for Kent Justice. Our first guest serves as the mayor of Fernandine Abiche and four terms in the state house. He is now a long time member of the Florida Senate. Republican Aaron Bean is with us. Good morning, Senator. And first of all, congratulations. You've been elected as Senate President Pro Tempory. Besides local pride, Senator, when it comes to nuts and bolts, what's that going to mean to our area? First of all, good morning, Tom Willes. It's great to be with you in the studio. Although we're technically not together, we are together. So very good morning. And it's always great to be with you. It's certainly exciting for me, but it's exciting for Jacksonville. That gives Jacksonville a seat at the leadership table for the Florida Senate. Work has already begun and I have spent the last few weeks over in Tallahassee, planning the groundwork of how we're going to operate in this new era of COVID. What kind of leadership will you have to provide to your colleagues, especially those on the Democrat side? Well, we all work together in the Florida Senate. Unlike Congress, there is a great deal of camaraderie in Tallahassee. We're forced to work together because unlike Washington, we can't print money. And so we have to come together to pass a budget each and every year. There's only 40 senators. And so the committees are smaller. You must work together if you want to accomplish things. Part of that job is a pro-temporary that I will be going forward with is really helping the success of all senators, as well as assisting Senate presidents, Wilton Simpson. We're off to a very strong start. And I look forward. The second week of January is when committees will start for the new year. And we're going to hit the ground running. Although COVID has put a damper on things. And we haven't yet finalized how the legislature during committees is going to operate just yet. We love to have an open sunshine government in the state of Florida. But with COVID, keeping people safe and distant is something that we're still finalizing the Tampa General Hospital, the epidemiologist at that facility, is causing us. And so we're trying to use best practices in order to operate a government and still give the public access. Senator, do you have specific priorities for the legislative session next year? You know, next year, one of my jobs. I've got several jobs. One, of course, as Senate, within the leadership realm of making sure everything is going well. I'll be chairing once again health appropriations, which is the chief spender for everything health care in the Florida Senate. That's going to be a challenge. There's a challenge there that I want to continue to talk about. In terms of legislation, child welfare is something that has been near and dear to my heart for many years. We've done numerous bills on child welfare. We do well in the state of Florida. Nine times out of ten, we get it right in terms of child placement. But this last couple of years for me, we're going to focus how to get the other 10 percent, how to get it right almost all the time when it comes to child welfare. So we've got room for improvement. And that's an area that I'll be focusing on come now, but officially in January. The late mayor, Jake Godbold told me once it's only fun to hold public office if you have money to spend anticipating the tax collections are going to be weighed down next year, allocating scarce resources may not be very much fun for you and your colleague, Senator. Tom Willes, that it's a great question and I love Jake Godbold. We are, you know, we miss him. One of the absolute greatest mayors we've ever had in in Jacksonville. He was absolutely right, though. He was absolutely right. We have a major challenge in the state of Florida. As you know, we have to pass a balance budget revenues are down and we intend to pass a balance budget. With revenues down, we have to examine every method that we are spending money on every project in the state of Florida, if reevaluate our priorities, but there will be significant reductions, significant reductions across the board. Health care is one of our big silos where we spend approximately 38% of our money that in education or two levels where reductions are expected. But we know that every budget line has people behind that budget line and so we have to be very careful of how we go forward in spending our money in the studio right now. I know she's listening is Brenda Priestly Jackson, who is a leader in Jacksonville's city council. She's also a leader within the school realm. So we have to be accountable to everybody to make sure that all the reductions that we're looking at have the minimal impact on the constituents of which they're intended to serve. I'm sending her our job as journalists is to hold your feet in the fire, but this is this week in Jacksonville. You've been over there in the state Senate for quite a while. You were in the house before. Are there any particular bills that you have sponsored? This is your opportunity to blow your horn is what I'm offering you. Are there bills that you have sponsored since you have been in the legislature that you're particularly proud of that you'd like to tell our audience about? Great question Tom Willes and unfortunately we don't have enough time to talk about all the bills, but just last year two of the ones last year we passed a license plate bill that creates 33 new license plates with reform of making sure that when you buy a charity license plate. It goes that the money that you intend to go to that charity does indeed go to that charity, but with the 33 new license plates we created millions of dollars are going to be raised for charity all across the sunshine state without government, you know without government having to pay for those programs. I'm excited about that we also passed last year reform on Florida's domestic violence program. We had a very inappropriate system and we had abuses from leadership of spending money inappropriately on just enormous executive salaries. If you remember the headlines the executive director of that agency had paid herself seven million dollars over the last few years just to a total abuse of power and greed and we passed a bill to bring reform so that when we put money towards domestic violence it truly goes towards helping those that are in a horrible situation domestic violence to making sure the money is accountable. As a journalist I know you're holding people accountable we like to do the same thing in the Florida legislature is hold the programs that we fund accountable for success. Well speaking of holding people accountable are you troubled that the governor is not ordered a statewide mask mandate senator. I am not I am not he is allowed local local mayors he is allowed local county commissions their own their own way and what works best here may not work somewhere else the same way so he is he's done just a tremendous job keeping Florida open but also keeping Florida safe. Dr Anthony Fauci says he's not going to be spending Christmas with his three adult daughters for the first time since they were born because of the pandemic if you don't mind me asking you senator being would you share with us what your families Christmas plans are. My plans are to bring bring people together I think we could do it in a safe way that Christmas is such a such a a holy time I believe there's there's much mental health and seeing loved ones now we have I have elder I have older in laws that are coming to the bean house for Christmas brunch but we're going to keep distance they've already told us that but we are so looking forward to seeing them. We nearly isolated during Thanksgiving so we're going to expand the the invites towards Christmas brunch but yet do it in a way where we can maintain a safe distance. It's such a personal decision for everyone senators senator being thank you for coming by Merry Christmas from all of us here at Channel 4 and Happy New Year and again thanks for being here. Tom thank you happy holidays. From state politics to the local level Brenda priestly Jackson from the city council is next on this week in Jacksonville.

Can we leave people up now? Let's wait a bit. Okay. Can we just open one present? Not quite yet it's almost ready. A pinch pinch pinch. You're up early. Yeah. I have an idea. You're watching this Week in Jacksonville. Joining us now Brenda Priestly Jackson Jacksonville City Council District 10 Ms. Jackson is also the chair of the Council's J.E.A. Investigative Committee. Councilwoman Jackson welcome first of all I'm sorry we can't be in the same room together we can't even bump elbows together but I want to welcome you and thank you for coming by and letting us talk with you for a while. Thank you for having me I'm happy to be here. Let's start with a proposal on developing lot Jake and you just tell us where you stand on this pending legislation introduced by Mayor Curry and negotiated with the Jaguars. Well I can't say at this point how exactly I will probably vote on the final piece of legislation I am reviewing it like many of my colleagues on the council. But I'll tell you that my focus is probably a little different from some and so what does that mean naturally as a fiduciary agent or elected official we want to make certain that our neighbors get the best return on investment and that we don't support or finance something to the detriment of our other needs i.e. infrastructure and something else so that's why I start but I also think that this if it's the right deal can be a wonderful opportunity to somewhat pay something forward what do I mean. If we are able to off low the liability for the cleanup and mitigation of lot Jay as well as have future and demnification of any liability and we flow from that to the developers that might be an incalculable return on our investment particularly for our Gen Z and millennials who are excited about the prospect of a live entertainment district and I would say why is that a pay it forward because unfortunately we have made a decision as a city. To settle them with repayment of the pension liability starting in 2030 so maybe this would kind of balance some of that out and that's definitely consideration for me in terms of clean clean up and of the site and future cost to the city. Did you have specific questions for the jaguars and did you get your questions answered. I haven't gotten all of my questions answered and they're not just for the jaguars or just questions in general related to that to one is of course going to be as I share the ability to have the developer responsible for the liability of the clean up and mitigation and future and demnification but also my concerns are a component for neighbors in terms of employment opportunities not just in construction but going forward and employment opportunities for neighbors that increase our tax base locally and all levels of employment that's available so that means I've got to be able to do that. I don't want them to just have service sector jobs we want middle managers and we want whatever other positions that may pay well above a living wage or establish a healthy middle and upper middle class lifestyle. I also want to know that what we do on like J is self contained what do I mean by that so the landing was a broad undertaking that never reached this actual full potential. I believe that with like J we have an opportunity to actually fully develop that and is scalable if we decide as a city we want to do that it is not contingent upon any other future development so we don't find ourselves with something that we modeled on another city that we never fully actualize and developed. This developer has done similar projects in other cities Pittsburgh Kansas City I think maybe Louisville but you know the city council has not been able to take a road trip right to see exactly what this is going to be. Right so I think I think a couple things there been some conversations and actually that started well before the city council currently became involved. Unfortunately I think the timing of this is a little bit challenging because there is a sense of urgency and rush felt by the members of the city council and more importantly felt by our neighbors on a whole that we will rush to a decision without properly vetting this item. I can tell you as one council member of 19 that I'm not going to do that I don't believe any of my other colleagues will as well but I think what I am aware of in terms of the development of the areas those areas are extremely diverse. I think a Baltimore those areas have a development that I have seen not personally but I've seen on paper that would be attractive to that level of nature of development again scalable perhaps in the future for Jacksonville. I think that as we work that out the answer is not do we do like J or finance like J and have the taxpayers pay the cost for that to the detriment of any other needs I infrastructure I except it's this is an opportunity to show our neighbors how we can do both how we can take care that every day needs of our neighbors which we are charged to do and I consolidate government and we can foster creative development for the future as well. Let's move now to the committee that you're on and are now leading that has been looking into the failed attempt to privatize the J. E. A. Will your report be released at the end of the year as scheduled it will be yes it will be so the the S. I. C. report special and vestigatory committees report on J. A. will be released by the deadline which is December 31st 2020 and I would anticipate that it will be available via website and hard copies right after we resume from our city council's recess it has been a very engaging informative informative 10 and a half months that we've been working but for council members I would contend that many of us have been working for 15 months this is what greeted us right after we became members of the city council and together with our neighbors many in the press the media and various various civic organizations we were able to maintain the municipal ownership of our local utility and make certain that we maintain our quality of life in Jacksonville as well any smoking guns and that report council woman no and I don't think so I will tell you that I think that it's it's not with ethical considerations going forward potential conflicts going forward and I charge is to make recommendations from this that need to be changed in the charter right so we are not a criminal investigative arm you know we are the city council the legislative branch of the consolidated government of Jacksonville Duval County and I think that you're going to see not only the proposed redraft of chapter 21 that we've already undertaken but I will anticipate you will see the proposed charter changes from everything possibly to what are prohibitive transactions what kind of entities can be involved doing business with the city council the executive branch are independent authorities third party respondents to contracts procurement procedures and all of that so I cannot say where the line of legality and illegality was crossed in this but I can definitely say the line of the ethical considerations and ethical conflicts was definitely trampled in this thank you councilman Brenda preach Lee Jackson thank you for your time and again from all of us here at Channel 4 Merry Christmas to you and your family thanks for all you do and happy new year same to you and I wish you a happy new year Merry Christmas as well peace one final segment in our broadcast Amy Barnett will fill us in on the American civility association how they are stepping up to help make our schools safer stay with us on this week in Jacksonville Jacksonville different donating five hundred dollars with every new Subaru so drive a Subaru you'll buy a Subaru ladies check it out so strong so not wet what are we talking about that's the hefty ultra strong back hefty hefty hefty give me the bad get hefty ultra strong at a low price do you have dry cracked hands from constant washing cold weather and hard work try out keeps working hands it's America's number one selling hand cream for guaranteed relief for extremely dry cracked hands also available in a key slip repair guaranteed relief for extremely dry cracked lips.

Drive a Subaru you'll buy a Subaru you're watching this week in Jacksonville on Channel 4. Amy Barnett is back with us today Amy welcome. Thank you so much it's a pleasure to be here Tom and Amy I say back because you and Kent spoke in twenty sixteen about this organization and for those who don't know I'd like you to describe what the American civility association is and what it does well the American civility association is a nonprofit with a mission to end bullying and school violence and today that mission is so important the violence has been escalating in our nation and that goes into the schools as well. In fact there have been over two hundred schools that have had shootings where there have been either injuries or sadly fatalities just in the last eleven years and thirty three of those have been since 2019. Thirty three schools so our job is so important and that's what we are here for and we are making a difference and bringing some solutions. Can you give me an idea about the difference that you're making and about the solutions. American civility has worked with a team of fabulous experts from the educational fields from medical fields and the neuroscience arena. And have developed programs we have under the name boss programs boss stands for brain builders operation safe schools and students are given the opportunity to develop skills and tools around brain building. They've learned that stress and anxiety are basically hijacking the oxygen in our brain and so when we are hijacked like that we cannot learn we cannot problem solve or be very creative and as the stress and anxiety and violence has escalated in our country so have the learning gains have been harder to achieve for students. So we bring brain tools such as gratitude kindness teach children how to care about one another show compassion and transform their school climates from meanness and rudeness and those negative trends that are out there right now in our schools those have been totally switched around to cultures of kindness. And the great result is that the learning gains have gone up the suspensions are down 35% the disciplinary referrals are down between 60% to 90% in some schools graduation rates are up. Kids are coming to school because they don't fear going to school they're not afraid where over half of the children in elementary school say they're afraid of violence in school that something bad may happen so our programs actually equip them to be able to address those things and not be fearful. Amy so much and congratulations in the work that you're doing and from all of us here at Channel 4 Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Thank you and same to you Tom Merry Christmas. Thank you for joining us today can't we'll be back next week with the school superintendent of the year here in Florida that would be our very own Diana Green plus pay center for girls stretching out to Georgia this week in Jacksonville airs each Sunday morning at this time. Thank you for watching and we'll see you next week. See why every day more people are choosing news for Jackson Northeast Florida and South Georgia's number one source for local news.",

        "transcript": " Good afternoon. Welcome to the fourth annual closing ceremony for the Hank and Billy Suver Aaron Summer Young Scholars Research Institute. And I'm thrilled that Mrs. Aaron is here with us this evening and you'll hear briefly from her. And the research institute is under the auspices of the Samuel DeBoys Cook Center on social equity and Mrs. Cook and her family are here with us as well. So there's a few people I would like to thank before introducing our keynote speaker this evening. These are folks without whom this summer research institute could not have occurred. And in particular I want to thank Dr. Gwendolyn Wright, our Director for Strategic Initiatives and Collaborations, who basically organizes this this operation every year. So thank you to her. And in addition I would like to thank Joanne O'Neill, our grants manager, who has worked hard with this program every year as well. And I thank you to Alexandria Miller, our communication specialist, Imari Smith, one of our research associates, and Chris Allen Cooksy, who's not with us this evening but who did a significant amount of work on behalf of the camp. I'd also like to thank, and these are folks who are essential to thank, are instructors for the summer institute. One of whom has been with us every year since the program began Mr. Raymond Beeman. I'd also like to thank Miss Allison Edwards, Miss Cheyenne Solorio, Mr. Michael Agri Jr. and Miss Jackie Bottes. Now the summer research institute is a collaboration with the Durham Public Schools. So I would be most remiss if I did not say thank you for the support that they provided, particularly with respect to transportation for the students. And specifically I would like to thank Dr. Daniel Bullock, who you will also hear from later this evening. The Executive Director of Equity Affairs for Durham Public Schools, who has been one of the people who was inspirational in the formation of this program at the outset. And he has been assisted ably by Germaine Porter, who is the leader of the Boys of Color Initiative. We've had several guest speakers throughout the course of the summer. They have included Jillian Johnson, who is one of our local council members, Chuck Manning Sr., my graduate student, Agine Clemens, who gave a presentation on police behavior, which is a theme that's also reflected in the work that some of the students have been doing. Andrea Harris, Brenda Howardton, Attorney Nisha Williams, and two of the postdoctoral fellows at the Cook Center, Paul Robbins, and Lana Cah Blackman Carr. Finally I would like to thank the student interns. These are folks who were formally in the program, but they graduated last year, and they were enthusiastic about the prospect of coming back to the summer camp for another year. And so they joined us as interns. These include Amazinde Adi, Bolu Agasa, Sydney Grissom, Elijah Kang, and Kennedy Ruff and Rachel Ruff. So I'm very, very thrilled to have the opportunity to introduce our keynote speaker this evening, Mr. Reginald Bean. Reginald Bean is vice president of culture, engagement, and stewardship for Coca-Cola consolidated. He is based in Charlotte and North Carolina. And in his role, he's responsible for enhancing the employee experience by providing strategic direction and planning and promoting a purpose-driven value-based culture for effective employee engagement. In addition, his responsibilities include developing external relationships with strategic outreach organizations, with a purpose of enhancing the experience for employees, customers, and partners. He is also the author of the book, Unfinished, Forty Lessons of Purpose Self and Becoming a Man. This is an inspirational text. She told me, is motivated by his passion for trying to address issues that surround the maintenance of the integrity of the Black family and the role of fatherhood. So we're very pleased to have Mr. Reginald Bean with us this evening. Thank you. Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightening about shrinking so other people won't feel insecure around you. We're all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us, it's in all of us. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. Good evening. Oh come on now. Good evening. It is such a pleasure for me to be here today really celebrating and such an awesome facility with the Celebrating the Legacy. So Dr. Sam Cook Center on Social Equity. This is a bad brother. He was an activist, a pioneer, the first African American professor here at Duke University. So many more accolades that I can simply do my presentation just covering Dr. Cook. Mr. Hank Aaron, we all many of us know him about from his work done in the Negro League and in MLB, 23 seasons as an outfielder for the Milwaukee Brewers in Atlanta Braves. But his most significant work wasn't on the field. I'm sure he would say if he were here, his most significant work was off the field, havin' a way so we can have evenings like we have today. But for both of them, I want to honor their families, the Cook family as well as Mrs. Aaron. So if we could just take a second and just let's acknowledge their presence here today. And before I get into my remarks, I want to celebrate the young people who did the work this summer as well as the families that supported them. So give yourselves a round of applause. So on behalf of our chairman and CEO Frank Harrison, our president Hank Flint and the 17,000 teammates that we have across 15 states, I want to say thank you for allowing me to share this moment with you today. However, as I get into my remarks, I just want to share with you two questions that I've struggled with along my journey to get here today. But as I was driving over from Charlotte, I came in last night, generally driving is relaxing for me. And on this particular Sunday afternoon, I'm flipping through stations on XM radio and I keep running to the same types of channels or the same types of conversations on every channel. It's really highlighting the divisiveness that we're experiencing in our country today. So every time I stopped on the channel, they were talking about the same guy. They were talking about his secret meetings, his tweet storms, his cryptic messages. And for me, the drive is normally peaceful, but I would start to lose my mind. And from a sanity perspective, I said, what would I do if I was in his shoes? Now, generally, I'm disgusted when we talk about the divisive nature of our country. But then I thought, let me put his shoes on for a second. This guy has four years to make an impact. Now, many of us have questioned his approach. His business ventures have been scrutinized and his global connections in question. And again, I asked myself, this guy has four years to leave his mark, to leave what he considers his legacy. He's hired friends, he's hired his friends for important positions. He's actually tried to position his kids for legacy well beyond his. Now, my thought process moved from, I want to understand what it's like to be in his shoes. And to, by the time I made it here, I was actually aligned with his thinking. Now, I know this may not get me invited back here. But I had to just celebrate, you know, LeBron James and him signing for four years with the Los Angeles Lakers. Oh, did you guys thought I was talking about 45? I'm talking about 23. And just wanted to celebrate his four years of taking the shot at creating a new legacy for him and his family. But the most important thing I thought about LeBron was he did not let his starting point dictate his path throughout life. So I hope I get an invitation back. I'm sorry to put everybody on edge there. It's like you guys faces were like, okay, who's this guy? And how to get here again? But again, my name is Reginald Bean, vice president of Coatrin Engagement with the late nation's largest Coca-Cola bomber. My job is fairly simple. Inspired 17,000 people to bring their best version of themselves to work every day. I've also had the privilege of serving in the military around the world. And I came back with one, one really good point was I understand really the the thread that connects us all as humans. So whether I served a bit time out on the west coast, Northern California, or Southern Korea, or the time I spent in Japan or Thailand, I realized that one thing we all have in common. So I want the best for our families. We all want equal opportunities to really showcase our intellect. But my journey didn't begin there. My journey began in Detroit, Michigan in 1974. So I'm an 80s baby. So I grew up in the 80s. And during that time that was the height of the crack epidemic. That was the number one or number two, just depends on what metric you were using. They were the highest murder per capita. It was a neighborhood where access to quality education and quality food were pretty scarce. However, my neighborhood was made up of quality people. So we lacked on resources, but we made up with character. In fact, there was a time when community parenting still was a thing. Right? And so if you did something at school, by the time you got home, the situation was rectified. But I grew up in a unbelievably, unbelievably loving environment. That was just dysfunctional. So I'm the middle of three boys. I'm the middle of three boys raised by mom. Who worked multiple jobs and her desire was simply to keep her safe. But with every challenge that was faced and everything that my mom couldn't afford us, I had an awesome grandmother. Any Margaret was her name. Now any Margaret was the sweetest lady who can make the sweetest sweet potato pie. And she give you one of these if you did something, but we all knew she was not going to do anything. But she was an activist. She was an educator. She was a great example of what a servant leader was before we start using the term servant leader. But I lost my grandmother when she was 55 years old. And now that somebody who is a lot closer to 55, I realized I don't have a whole lot of time on my hands. But with every turn in life, there were people who filled in for the things that she offered me. So again, two things that I two questions that I struggle with throughout my journey. Two things. How much time do I have and how precious is that time? How much time do I have? Again, four years LeBron has to make an impact. There's a lot that can happen in four years. Right? So some of you young people think four years is a long time. If you look over at your parents, they say four years is not a long time. So think about what can happen in a span of four years. So in four years, most of the technology that all of you are using was developed just in four years. Think about it. Gmail, Twitter, the iPhone, YouTube, all within a four years span were all developed. You think about some of Martin Luther King's most prominent years. Some of his most successful years came within a four years span. And I'd say the time that Jesus spent with his disciples three and a half years. So if you think about four years, really isn't a lot of time. So I had a chance to really check out some of your research posters and some of your research papers. Some of them covering healthcare, mental wellness, education, gender disparities. And I'll tell you, I thought I was coming here to leave you with a couple nuggets. And I was thoroughly inspired by what I read. The research that you've done, the time, the pride that you took into some of the work that you've done. But today, I still want to leave you with the nuggets that I brought for you. So there's seven of them. And most of you have heard some of these before. Some of you have asked Alexa or Siri, some of these same questions. But I just want to inspire you today. The first is get there before you get there. Now some of you have heard this. Get your head in the game. Believe you're going somewhere before you get there. But I want to remind you that to just believe and believe that God has a plan for you before you even see what that is. So dream it before you get there. Right. And so when I see the work that you guys have done today, I'm encouraged that you guys are thinking beyond today. So if you look to your left and you look to your right, I promise this is not a sermon. I'm not going to ask you to hug your neighbor. But if you look to your left and you right, some of the folks that are around you won't be on the journey with you. Some of the folks that are around you are just in your life temporarily. Now that's excluding parents. But I want to encourage you to look around you when you make it back to your homes, to your schools, to your churches. And ask yourself, who's in my circle? Who's going to be on this ride with me? Who's going to encourage me to get there before I get there? And sometimes, you know, as I was driving on campus, I think about how many people made it to this university for this program that may not have had the opportunity to do so before, you know, whether the school system invited you in or somebody called you and say, hey, there's a great program that I want to encourage you to be a part of. You know, sometimes we have to move on to move up, meaning we have to move out of our circles in order to take advantage of the opportunities. Sometimes we have to move out of our comfort zone in order to truly take advantage of the opportunity. So the third point is move on in order for you to move up. Now, when I was in the military, I was stationed in Northern California. So most of my assignments were with a military intelligence unit. So when you're assigned with a unit, you actually have to do what the unit does. And so in this particular scenario, Northern California, this unit that I was stationed with, they would do an annual 20 mile hike. Now, this wasn't just with your A6 and some underarmors shorts on. This is with full gear, helmet, boots, the whole nine. Now, when I got there, we started this hike at three o'clock in the morning. And I couldn't understand why we started to early three o'clock in the morning. And so one of the guys reminded me that, hey, you know, this is these are mental games. So if you start the hike by the time you're halfway through, the sun's coming up. And so mentally, you think it's a new day. So you start off when it's dark by the time the sun comes up, it's a mentorship. So the same I would encourage you to apply to your life. It's a mentorship. So recognize some of the challenges that are ahead of you, but understand the rules of the game. Sometimes we're playing with rules. We're playing the wrong rules to the game to the game of life. So just understand and recognize, recognize the game, a mental game that is. And then most of all, most of all, it's often our struggles, our story, no matter where we come from, that really propels us in life. And some of us are so afraid to look in the mirror and just smile back at it's eye to ourselves. To love ourselves, to hug ourselves. And so my next point here is respect the reflection. Respect to you are as a person, love who you are as a person. And some of us had any control over the circumstances that we were born in. I love youself anyway. Respect the reflection. There's enough people that encourage you not to respect who you are. So respect the reflection. And then this notion of fear. We all have it. You think about the idea most of us tell us that we shouldn't be afraid. Most people tell us just to just you know, put your chest out, tie your boot straps up and move forward. But I want to encourage you. Slightly different today fear exists. Fear exists, but I want to encourage you to lean into it. That's what courage comes from. Courage comes from walking through it even when you get afraid. Courage comes from signing up for the program even when your friends are kind of chilling for the summer. Courage comes from standing up and being proud to present your work even though you may be a little nervous to speak in public. So fear exists. My encourage to you is just leaning to it. And as we stand into the the the the the the the doctor cook center on social equity. And we remember Mr. and Mrs. Aaron. These folks will change and change makers. So I want to encourage you not to wait for somebody else to to impact change in our families and our communities and our circles. The change makers are right here in this room. So I want to encourage you to lean into accepting that that role of being a change maker, being a change agent. And so as you begin your the next chapter life whether that's your next semester in high school, whether it's your next season playing basketball. I want to encourage you to recognize the many people who paved the way for you. Whether it's your parents that's paying the fee. Whether it's your counselor that's encouraging you. Or whether it's Dr. Cook and his family or Mr. and Mrs. Aaron that's encouraging you. You know something I didn't finish that story about my grandmother. There were several people who played a role in truly planting seeds in my life. Some of them never got to solve the tree that grew because they planted no seeds 20, 25 years ago. So I just want to remind you to give a fist pump, give a hug, give a kiss to folks who are planting seeds in your life because many of them. They may not see the tree fully bloom. Those may be counselors. They may be instructors. They may be just folks. They may be neighbors, but just I just want to remind you that there's significant people that play roles in our lives that are planting seeds that they won't ever get to see grow. They plan them. Sometimes they fertilize in them. We call that discipline, but they're fertilizing them. But just remember that there are people playing significant roles and planting seeds that they won't ever get to see the fullness of who you who you're going to become. But I also want to encourage you to begin planting seeds. Now there's no age restriction on when you can start motivating somebody else. There's a there's a younger version of you waiting in the wings waiting to be encouraged waiting for them somebody to give them a word of encouragement planting a seed. So I just want to remind you as I wrap up, I'm living proof of seeds planted prayers answered and a lot of community feedback and discipline. So thank you again for allowing me to share this evening with you. Again, I thought I was coming to bring you again and I'm walking away with more than I came with. So thank you and enjoy the rest of your evening. Hello and good evening. Our group is on gender roles and social inequalities. Hello, my name is my Parker. I'm going not in high school. My name is Michael Jennings and I'm also going to Northern high school. And my name is Jimi Nisleena's and I'm going to JD Clement early college. Now our driving question is how do gender roles impact society? You may be asking what are gender roles? Well, a general is a role or behavior learned by a person as appropriate to their gender determined by prevailing cultural norms. Now our first topic, our first sub topic is how do just codes affect a female students education. Now this graph is from a presentation done survey done in 2014 in 2015 from 183 people and a whopping 148 of them agreed that dress codes are extremely strict towards female students. According to Papalans once in a 1999 they say that the original intended purpose of a dress code is for safety reasons for pride and for discipline. Now, 57% of all schools across the country have a very strict dress code and the dress code in the graph you see before you is a dress code of DPS. Now look at this. Look how many of these rules are against female students. No spaghetti straps, no halter tops, no strapless, no headwear, no seat-through garments, no mesh garments, mid-thigh shorts. Boys get the easy ones, no baggy clothes, pants at waist level. These all are targeting and impacting a female students education. Thank you. All right. Our next sub topic dealt with Mill Salt and Prisons and why it is under reported. It seems to stem from the fact that the stereotypes of men that they are aggressive, worseful, unemotional and can handle things themselves. About around 200,000 men are assaulted in prisons but only a small percentage come forward. A study done in 2010 by Miller says that majority of them, about 35%, don't come forward due to embarrassment because they feel like a loss of immaculity. It also doesn't help that prison police in the prisons don't, they usually turn the blind eye to it and don't try to stop it. Some of the effects in society themselves, they get a joke with such phrases that don't job to soap and even a popular TV series called SNL, or Saturn and Ike Live where they kind of have a segment called Scared Straight where they kind of glorify the life of a prisoner. Some of the effects of not being able to come forward and talk about it are depressions to the cytosol thoughts, even death. Our final sub topic is about how gender roles affect mental health. These roles that are shown are the stereotypical American gender roles. According to health guidance and planned parenthood, the gender roles for men are that they should be self-confidence and even a little aggressive at times, an appearance they should be tall and masculine and they should always be able to handle the problems by themselves. On the other hand, women are expected to be more emotional in understanding, an appearance they should be thin and graceful and they should always be able to care for their children. Because of the stereotype that women are more likely to be emotional than men, they are more likely to see help. For example, a study done at Clark University found that women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression, which could be caused by poor social status, low income or even gender-based violence. In comparison, men who are expected to keep their problems private have a suicide rate of 3 to 5 times higher than women. And they are 2 to 3 times more likely to suffer from substance abuse. These are partially caused by extreme gender roles. The chart on the left shows the suicides in males and females in the USA from 2005 to 2016. From the data provided, you can see that men will have a more difficult time seeking mental health. This is because of the pressures of society of what a man and a woman should or should not be. These are our solutions for the problems that we've mentioned today. A solution for gender roles negatively impacting mental health could be to teach children in school classes such as health and gym that it is okay for them to seek help no matter what their gender is. Some possible solutions for male assault and prisons could be better supervision over the prisons, but better methods of speaking out and also having medical or mental health services talk to them. And a solution for how dress codes affect female education is if a dress code disproportionately targets a female student more than male students, then it should be changed or enforced fairly. And our overall solution for our main topic is more portrayal of gender based issues in media and in education and having discussions at a younger age and not press stereotypes or general's on children. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Tonight we're going to discuss the impact of racial bias in advanced academics. My name is Nye King and I go to northern high school. My name is Mary Henry and I go to early college high school. My name is Nye Batson and I go to care into middle school. My name is Jasmine Ross and I will be attending into two of the development of young leaders. My name is Maria Sanders and I go to Hillsett High School International Baccalaureate. The big concept question that we will be answering throughout the presentation is how is racial bias impacted access to advanced classes and get their programs. Advanced academics is mainly comprised into three different categories. Honours, AP and ID. Honours classes run at a faster pace than AP classes. I mean, the standard classes. AP classes are established by the college board and they give you college credits if you take the classes and I be classes also give you college credits. This little background for our presentation and 1954 the Brown versus Board of Education ruling integrated public schools nationwide. Before minorities for being limited to this number of schools they could attend. This is what now we're being limited to the number of classes that we can attend. So as you see in the class, only 12% of the different ways that then white students attend AP classes and 88% of white students attend AP classes. So these are the causes in that segregation and how it impacts schools today especially in AP classes. So teacher bias. The disparities in discipline begins in preschool and what that means is they start judging you in preschool and 80% out of 80% of black kids in preschool, 42% of those students are more likely to be in the out of school. So they start judging you in the out of school suspension and a little grade. And that means teachers really don't want you to be in AP classes. And really teachers, some of them really don't care to lack of access. Black students don't know about AP classes. And sorry. Some teachers don't tell that black students are they need to be in AP classes. Okay, so my topic is on what limits minorities access to advanced classes. Our claim is saying that the achievement gaps in tracking are the causes of which teachers make expectations for students and also teacher bias and cultural bias, which is treating someone different because of their cultural background. And now I'm going to talk about tracking tracking is academic. It starts as soon as kids start school, which is normally in kindergarten. Tracking track students on a different path based on their academic performance, whether they're tracking that high achievement classes or low achievement classes is very difficult to explain, but I'm going to try to shorten them. But white and Asian kids tend to be tracked into a higher level classrooms and black and Hispanic kids tend to be tracked into lower placement or lower achieving classrooms. As you can see, I have some statistics up there explaining exactly the percentage, but the quote is by Archie Duncan who is who was the US Secretary of Education. And explaining to the school districts that this is a big problem and it's re-sacrigating schools and classrooms around the nation and needs to stop. And also, the possible solutions for this problem include programs like LEAP. LEAP is a program for Latinos and LEAP stands for Latinos, Excel and Advanced Placement. The program places students in classes and then support them by improving their social skills. It also encourages Latino students to take a P classes that will benefit them once they are enrolled in college. The program has opportunities for the students to also be open to college tutors. The tutors will benefit those students when it comes to them receiving the college level work in high school. Teachers and counselors also play a big role in placing students in advanced classes. Teachers can create appropriate curriculum that will prepare the students for their advanced work and counselors can help identify those students who are ready to enroll into those advanced classes. In conclusion, it is possible to desegregate advanced classes but we as students faculty and government officials had to be determined enough to do so. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Our research system was owned this golden prison pipeline. My name is Tio Walker and I will be attending London High School this year. My name is Stadis King and I will be going to early college. My name is Fulmi Adiel and I will be attending City of Medicine Academy. My name is Ronne Homen and I'm a resident in here at Hills High School. Our research question was how has the school to prison pipeline affect African American students academically? The school to prison pipeline is a system that funnels children at a school through and into adult and juvenile confectioner facilities through parish punishments. My research was owned the start of the school to prison pipeline and there are multiple starts and causes. The school to prison pipeline was a zero-toronto policy which was made during the school year war in 1998 to 1997. It was made to keep schools safe by keeping bullying and violence out of schools that made it twisted into feeding racial biases and targeting minority kids. I was a counselor to help students that may be acting out and instead of making them to isolated by making them not feel isolated and trying to solve the problem and trying to see if it's something from home. Another one is principal choices as in the principal decides if a student is suspended it's spelled or anything if they get into a conversation with other students or teachers. They can leave them possibly going to court and be in front of the system. They also depend on SROs to discipline and serve during their job which is for test students and making them feel safe by making them target students especially minorities and black students. And making them seem like every small thing that may be considered something bad I didn't truly train them as criminals. This slide shows data and statistics to support this on the left side it shows over the United States of how on eagerly African-Americans is are treated. The public schools are only about 15% but their 30% of them have been suspended at least once and 40% of African-American youth are in a different direction center. In the right you see demographics from drum public schools showing how many are in schools is actually 48% almost half of the school are African-Americans but 80% of them have been suspended at least once. Some of the effects in school are African-American students are 4 or 3.5 times more likely to be suspended than the white counterparts for doing the same thing. Unnecessary explosions and suspensions and put kids behind in class and make it harder for them to come back up and learn and improve. This can also cause tension between the students and the teachers. For example if a student got into a fight with another student then maybe that teacher thinks that this student only likes to fight and you know we should target him or hurt. Lastly kindergarteners are 82% of them have 82% chance of being suspended once or twice in their first year for doing nothing. Suspensions and expulsions can really change the mindset of a kid which is why once he has lived school after being affected by the school to present pipeline they are often left broken and mentally unstable. A statewide study found that stool districts with larger rates of suspensions and expulsions have lower rates of graduating students. Another study found that over half of Black young men who attend urban high schools do not earn a diploma and of the job outs nearly 60% will go to jail at some point in their life. This makes it difficult to find jobs because many businesses don't want to hire former inmates which is the reason why they have higher unemployment rates. And the ones that do they don't pay very well which is why they have less pay. The possible solution to the school to present pipeline is the story of justice. The story of justice is our turn of criminal justice system. RRP. It is a national institute for restorative practices which are stored with justice programs and schools and is the first graduate school wholly dedicated to restorative practices. The school to present pipeline was started by zero tolerance policies that were put in place to make schools safe and actually did it. The solution to less than the issue such as restorative justice programs and community organizing for education reform. The school to present pipeline is the first graduate school to present pipeline. The school to present pipeline is the first graduate school to present pipeline. Good evening everyone. My name is Jaden and I will be arising sophomore at early college. My name is Jonathan and I will be going to Northern high school. My name is Zachary and I will be attending the city of medicine. Our subject was the prison industrial complex. Our big question is how do policy makers go about creating the laws that benefit corporations within the prison industrial complex? Our main topic was the prison industrial complex which is a term you subscribe the intersect the interests of private corporations and government. They use actions such as policing surveillance and imprisonment to meet their needs which could be financial, political or social. This is the 13th amendment. The 13th amendment says that slavery is illegal except as a punishment for a crime. This amendment was passed by Congress in January 31st 1865 and ratified in December 6th 1865. This picture right here was taken during the sharecropping era which was an institution put in place after slavery. This picture right here was taken at a farm which uses prison labor. Policies within the prison industrial complex are restraints your out mandatory minimums and tax code 3306. The restraints your out is you are given a life sentence after on your third felony. The mandatory minimums are the judge cannot sentence you to any time lower that can give you extra time. That's code 3306 says that labor done in prison or a penal institution does not count as labor or employment. The American Legislative Exchange Council and the prison industry enhancement certification program are both influential in the prison industrial complex. Allic is a group of corporations that help create laws that can authorize and increase prison labor. According to the Baruch Justice it's supposed to be a government program that puts prisoners in working environments and it was be paid rightful wages for that work. Whether they're actually not paid very much at all around $5 to $8 a week. Businesses that also benefit from the PRC includes Walmart, O Foods, AT&T and Victoria Secret. As I stated earlier, prisoners don't get paid very much at all so they can make high profit from this. Individuals who benefit personally from the prison industrial complex are Henry Woodell. He made $25 million dollars and he made $25 million dollars on shares in the private prison industry and he served on the course of explore from 2001 through 2012. George Zoli made $6 million dollars in bonuses alone and he also owns $23 million dollars in private prison industry. Jerry Middich and Mitch Serevich owns together $300 million dollars in the private prison industry. The GEO and Coursific are some of the largest lobbyists for the prison industrial complex. Funding around $25 million in private prisons because of this they made $3.3 billion dollars. Marco Rubio is a big political factor. He has had close ties with the GEO receiving nearly $40,000 in donations from them. All right, so groups such as Alec play a big part in the prison industrial complex. They also have the power to pass laws that prohibit prison labor. Solutions to end the prison industrial complex are the disbandment of groups such as Alec and Pi abolishing tax code 3306 and paying prisoners the right for wage. Problems we could face while trying to abolish such tax code would be lack of support from our peers and rejection by the Congress. Right now we can't do anything unless we're like to enter Congress. So together we can go into Congress and abolish this tax code. It's a hard thing to do but together we can make it possible. And to break up groups such as Alec and Pi we can petition them and expose them to the world who they really are. I know people already know much about Alec but I is not really a big group known to the world. And this picture here is prisoners and they're making helmets or military and other military paraphernalia. Overall slavery is unfortunately still the odd country today and if you were by Cooper and Mogul's we benefit financier for prison labor and are protected by laws within the PSE. The prison industrial complex but with persistence and in hard work we can change these laws and thank you. Good evening. Our presentation is on the effects of media representation on perception identity and housing. My name is Julius King and I'm going to be attending the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. My name is Deja Operen and I'll be going to Northern next year. My name is Alex McCalman and I attain Northern high school. My name is Langston Brooks and I'll be going to Jordan high school. So our main question was how does racial misrepresentation and bias affect identity and perception and also how do those perceptions affect displacement of minority? So a basic definition of colorism is the discrimination against a darker skin tone group of people. And so the American growth of colorism started during American slavery when slaves that were born out of interracial relationships that bore lighter skin tone, the thought of smarter, more intellectual than their darker tone counterparts. So this granted them different advantages such as better paying jobs but where you see this more vividly and everyday life is in the media. And so this is a quote by Denzel Washington and he's talking about his daughter who's an aspiring actor set NYU and basically in the quote what he's telling about her is that she's a woman she's black and she's also dark skin so she's going to have to work harder than anybody else in the industry. Okay, so in a study conducted by social psychology quarterly 210 ninth and 10th grade girls were asked on a scale of one to 10 how important they thought it was for girls are age to read magazines the median or the middle of the data. So the response for black girls was a 2.5 while the median response for white girls was a 2.9. The black girls only read black magazines like essence and had a higher sense of individuality and self-esteem. So some examples of colorism in the media is in a study in 2017 70.8% of people in movies were white but also in the movie Black Panther. The majority of the cast was of African American descent and the portrayal was superheroes and warriors and also 6% of all characters in the Harry Potter movie series were minorities. Okay, so this is a study conducted by the National Study of American Life. The graph on the left depicts racial centrality the amount race plays in your identity increase as the subjects consumed more black information. So music movies TV shows the graph on the right depicts the subjects opinion for public regard decreasing as a consumption of black information increases. So this decrease in the opinion of public regard leads to a higher support of affirmative action by individuals because of their segregated media into. A study conducted by the Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media found that on a scale of 1 to 5 the median response to 202 African American support of affirmative action was a 4.2. The study also found that there is a correlation between public perception and support of affirmative action as well as a correlation between the negativity of a representation of blacks and the amount of disregard for blacks by other ethnic groups. What is gentrification? Gentrification is the process in which a wealthy population usually white moving to a neighborhood with lower cash value where there is mostly minority families. Causes of gentrification are the appeal of old houses with charm. So these old looking houses are like some people like this aesthetic so that may be a reason that they want to buy them. And the renovation of old homes when people see old rundown homes they typically buy them and then they make them really nice and sell them for thousands of dollars. And higher property values when this nice house that is moving to a poor neighborhood then all the other four houses there. Their property value is then rose to meet the wealthier wealthier houses price. And the graph shows some changes in some big cities and their homes. And then center city is where multiple business opportunities are so most people who live in center city want to live by their houses so their houses will be typically higher price. So those who have those higher paying jobs will pay more for those houses. And business attractions businesses go towards the population. So wherever the population is growing the businesses will go to have more customers. Very often before gentrification occurs there might be a negative perception of the neighborhood. The Google Territories is represented to the media as a bad neighborhood. The gentrification. The Google Territories was developed on. It was developed on vacant lands used to pay time in the EU as a part of a large scale public housing development and during fun it by the housing act of 1949. During the process of gentrification African-American who were lower income or displaced displacement occurs in any household is forced to move from its residents. You major racially segregated projects were developed in the early 1950s. A few gardens on the right. For white people and McDougal Terras on the left for African-American. The solutions are to integrate the media with the R races attempt to change the negative representations of minorities in the media are representing representing formidable role models. And for displacement to address the city's greatest housing needs by expanding affordable units. For those who are in displeased. I'm going to go to the next slide. How's everyone doing today? This is our presentation called policy implications on immigration. My name is Paulson Tarley. I'm going to hillside newtook. My name is Amlinovia. I'm attending Jordan High School. My name is Nancy Matute and I'm going to northern high school. Our research topic was within the last 10 years how have policies evolved and affected the flow of immigrants in America. Recently on social media we've seen immigration policies and we've also seen reduction of immigration and refugees. A refugee is a person forced to leave their country because of war. We've also seen policies discriminating people from Latin America and we've also seen people discriminate. Like policies discriminate people practicing Islamically. This is a photo of the Greece and Macedonian border in 2015. And this is a photo of a detention center in Macau in Texas in 2018. I will be comparing Obama's and Trump's policies on detaining immigrants. The Obama administration turned to mandatory detainment after the summer surge of 2014 which was the surge of women and children asylum seekers coming from countries like El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. On the other hand Trump turned to the zero tolerance policy because the crisis at the border was out of control. On an interview in 2017 he states that immigration on the border has been the lowest in 17 years. Both parties did practice detainment. Their methods of detainment were different. The Obama administration made efforts to detain families together and only separate them if suspected trafficking or fraud was involved. The Trump administration however separated families based on if they entered the country illegally or not. In 2342 children were separated from their families between May 5 and June 9. In the year 1995 Bill Clinton who at the time was the 42nd president of the United States. That said we are a nation of immigrants but we are also a nation of laws. This is a statement that is still relevant especially over the last 10 years. As 10 years ago President Barack Obama was elected and during his time in office he was able to establish two programs for immigrants. Those being DACA and DACA. DACA was a program that was for illegal immigrants who were young adults below the age of 31. And he expanded it for parents of Americans later on in 2014. These were deportation relief programs, illegal immigrants under work permits. Some would be for two or three years. I will be talking about how policy type affected refugees in America. The executive order 13769 or travel band was a band preventing travelers and refugees from Syria, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Yemen and Libya. The first band was lifted by courts because it was kind of like an anti-Muslim band and the courts lifted that. Sparing Iraq and then the second one was blocked and marched by judges. The third one was Supreme Court, the Supreme Court reinstituted some of the policies on the band saying that no one from Sean ties, no one from those places that has Sean ties to the United States could not come here. On the graph here shows that after 9-11 refugees reduced from 2012 and right now that Trump is in office, we can see that in 2018 the refugees have also reduced. The possible solutions I put make more make more rational laws not based on racial bias and maybe make programs for refugees. My solution for my research question, I said that there should be more programs similar to DACA as it was actually revoked by President Donald Trump recently. And for policy strategizing, they should look to like make a policy that helps the country more than just for political gain. The possible solution for the detainment issues of the government should put more effort into providing better living conditions for those who are trying to enter the country. Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. My name is OBS A. U.M.A. and I'm a rising sophomore at Josephine Dobs, Clemens Early College High School. Good evening. I'm Jacqueline Rice and I am a rising junior at Charles E. Jordan High School. Good afternoon. My name is Isra Phil Brandon. I'm a rising senior at Middle College High School at Durham Tech Community College. Our research project is titled Financial Literacy, a stepping stone to prosperity and our overall, our overarching research question was, how do financial institutions continue to take advantage of financially illiterate and financially disadvantaged people of color? Start off our presentation. I would like to ask the audience a quick question. If you take out a $1,000 loan that has a 20% interest rate, how much will you owe in a year's interest? Now give the audience a few seconds to answer the question. If your answer was B, then you were correct. However, if not, then you may be along with the 2-thirds of Americans who are considered to be financially illiterate. Did you know that according to the financial industry regulatory authority foundation, 66% of Americans are considered to be financially illiterate? Financial literacy in short-term is defined to be having the skills to make a smart and informed economic decision. You may ask why majority of Americans are financially illiterate and this stems from a lack of financial education in our homes and in our school system. According to financial expert Ryan Decker and his most recent TED Talk, 75% of Americans claim that they gain their basic financial knowledge from their parents. While only 33% of these parents claim that they frequently discuss finances with their children. This makes our parents as a primary source of financial education essentially a weak primary avenue. In the graph or map of the US behind me, five states in America require a semester among financial education courts. And according to the 2015 National Report card on states' efforts to improve financial literacy in high schools, these five states were the only states in America to perform at an A in financial education. These states being Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Utah, and Missouri. And as you can see, 23.5% of our states are failing with another 5.9% passing with a D. According to the US Department of Education, more than 40% of schools built in impoverished areas received poor funding from the government. And as you can see in the quote above by Arnie Duncan, who was a former educational secretary under Obama's presidency, the quote in summary states that policies that are allocating teachers and resources are further perpetuating the problem rather than solving it. And well, my sub question to our resource topic was how does an adequate education from underfunded schools impact students' financial decisions. And the insufficient funding from the government causes a lack of school resources, larger class sizes which results in many students' educational needs not being met, and also more importantly, a lack of financial education in our school system. Continuing on from an OBSI address about how children receive a week foundation of financial literacy and education, I continue to look into how to select a financial literacy and young adult impact their quality of life in the wealth of their defense. According to the Brookings Institute, there is a very strong correlation between financial literacy and financial mistakes. This is great for people who have good financial literacy, but is very unfortunate for people who do not. There are many unforeseen consequences of having weak financial literacy such as accumulating debt, having poor money management, low credit, living paycheck to paycheck, and potentially having to go without. A study by Operation Hope Incorporation made a test for high school seniors to measure their ability to make smart, informed economic decisions in the form of a test. Year on the graph are their scores. In every year tested, the black students scored noticeably lower than all of the white students. This is not to go without saying that it's a shame that all of our students fail, but there is a racial disparity within financial literacy. I believe that cumulatively with other factors such as a lack of generational wealth and a lack of liquid assets that people of color, this impacts people of color in the racial wealth gap. This can be seen in the articles, umbrellas don't make it rain and the median family wealth between white families and black families. That median white family has about $110,000 compared to the median black families wealth of only $7,000. Thank you. Financial decisions, financial decisions aside from one's base of knowledge may be further limited by systemic practice. I believe that the great recession and event integral to one of the largest net decreases in black wealth was caused by the repeal of a law designed to place restrictions on the activities banks can engage in. My driving research question this summer was looking at once glass seagulls lifted what did banks do how did banks newfound freedoms and lending practice affect people of color. Last in 1933 as a part of FDR's new deal, the glass seagull act was written to prevent banks from underwriting securities. In essence, by preventing banks from underwriting securities, financial institutions were forced down one of two paths. They could either be commercial institutions or investment institutions. While investment institutions deal in stock, commercial banks deal with businesses and the average person, you and I. Upon glass seagulls repeal, commercial and investment banks merged. This merger permitted the treatment of mortgages as investment assets. Because investors were eager to buy into the housing market, banks loosened their standards and engaged in predatory lending, predatory lending practice known as subprime lending. In a nutshell, subprime loans are loans that have low interest rates at first that quickly increase beyond a borrower's means of paying. At the time, investors thought that foreclosure is a non-issue, meaning that even if a borrower defaults, there is still a valuable house that can be sold for a return on their investment. The influx of subprime loans resulted in a staggering increase in home values nationwide, which is reflected in this graph from the US Census Bureau. It should be noted that subprime loans were disproportionately given to African-American Latinx borrowers. I'll be at the home ownership accounts for the majority of black wealth. When the housing market started crashing, circa 2007, the African-American and Latinx rate of foreclosure, comparative to what the white foreclosure rate is alarming. According to the Citizens Housing and Planning Association, Chapo, the completed foreclosure rate from 2007 to 2009 for African-American and Latinx borrowers was 8% respectively and it combined 16%. This is staggering in comparison to the 4.5% of non-Hispanic white foreclosure rate. This downward spiral came to a halt with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Dodd-Frank Act failed to re-separate investment and commercial institutions, it did take measures to regulate mergers and ensure banks don't engage in risk adverse activities. While preventative legal action has been taken in the way of Dodd-Frank, I believe that once understanding of finances equally as important to institutional change in adjustment, here are some plausible solutions. I propose that we should strengthen Dodd-Frank by re-separating commercial and investment institutions to mitigate the possibility of banks engaging in risk adverse activities. Our possible solution pertaining to the lack of financial education in our school systems is to require students to take a semester-long financial education course in order to graduate high school. Because I've seen in my portion of the research project in the beginning, the only five states to implement the requirement of a semester-long financial education course were the only five states in America to perform at an A. And we believe that if other states in America were to implement the same requirement that financial education performances were also we can arise. To increase the level of financial literacy, the M&S bank offers a financial literacy program called Money Smart. And we encourage you to encourage any young adults and teens in your life to attend these free workshop-based events and five cities throughout North Carolina such as Durham, Raleigh, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, and Charlotte. Thank you. I'd like to ask the third-year students to please come to the stage. So would you each introduce yourselves and indicate which school you have attended and also describe your final year project? Hi, my name is Akon Kay Mason-Hokins. I go to early college high school. I'm a third-year student in this program. And my research topic was looking at colorism and education and I was looking at disciplinary outcomes as well as achievement outcomes academically of darker skin students of color as related to lighter skin students of the same race. Hello, my name is Toby Adiel and I attend City of Medicine Academy. And my research was looking at the correlation between fraternities and sexual assault on college. Good evening, everyone. I'm Saunders-Intillion. My third-year project focused on the effects of incarceration on mental wellness. I studied the causes of intergenerational effects on mental illness and the results of incarceration on inmates. My name is Colin Brown. I go to Hillsont High School and my research was on comparing how the Black Wall Street and Tulsa and Durham were destroyed. Hi, my name is Samuel Phil Pot. I attend Hillsont High School and my research was on how the Wall and Drugs and the pharmaceutical industry conducted racial biases between drug abuse and how blacks were seen as criminals while many whites and rural areas with their pharmaceutical drugs. The pharmaceutical drug addictions have been treated and now we have opioid epidemics versus a war on drugs. On behalf of the 30th cohort, we would like to extend our appreciation to all the staff as help this research institute run. And here's a concave presentation of the gifts. Hi, so firstly wanted to thank the directors of this program who put so much energy to making sure we had somewhere to go this summer or the past three summers to do something that was meaningful. So first we want to thank Dr. Wright. I'll just say I'm all Dr. Bullock also. Thank you. And then also the namesake of this program is Billy Super Aaron. you And we'd also like to thank all of our instructors from the past three summers. So we have Mr. Beeman. Gloria. Miss bat. Miss Edwards. Our intern Miss Alexandria Miller. And then Mr. Michael. Oh, yes. And then we also want to give a shout out to Miss Addison Malone. She was our intern last year. She came all the way from New York. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You've heard from the first year students their oral presentations and you've had an opportunity to see the poster presentations from the second year students. And then we'll go back to the first year students to do in the booklet that the larger size booklet. So please take a look at their work. It's outstanding. Congratulations. Thank you. We're going to have some closing remarks. And the first person that we'll hear from is Dr. Bullock. Good evening. First of all, let's give another round of applause to all of these students. First, second, and third year cohort. And this is amazing to see. First of all, the first year students come up here with such confidence and poise. It is very difficult to get up in front of people and discuss topics that I mean they some of these topics they've just been learning about over the last few weeks or some of them they had already thought about them, but they really started analyzing them and more depth just over the last few weeks with the assistance of Miss Edwards and Mr. Beeman. And I also want to give a round of applause to the teachers. It is summertime. It can be a challenge to keep anyone engaged in this type of content over the summer. So it's just amazing to see what the teachers are able to do as far as engaging students challenging them to continue to grow and develop even in the summer. And then might would be rather be at home relaxing. And then the students who come to the program every year and show that dedication. It's amazing to see that. So I just on behalf of the school district on behalf of Durham Public Schools, I just want to celebrate our students our first, second, and third year students and our fourth year students who came back as interns this year. Shout out to them too. And a few of which are now I mean they're here this summer and they're going off to college in a couple of weeks, some of those interns. So their dedication to the program we truly appreciate it. And we thank you all for coming out tonight and supporting our students because as you can see, they are changing the world right now and it's amazing to see and I'm proud of them. Thank you. So when we first started the Samuel Du Bois Cook Center on social equity, we had an opening ceremony that was held at the National Museum and Mrs. Billy Aaron gave a phenomenal keynote address. So we're going to ask her to give us some words today. Not going to ask her to give us long and address as she did that evening, but I know you'll enjoy hearing from her. Thank you so much, Dr. Gerrardy. It's certainly a pleasure to be back with you and to see these young people perform and to see their exhibition or their presentations out front. And really I'm both just excited that you chose to name the Young Scholars Summer Institute for us. I can't say more. We are delighted. We are honored. We are pleased with the progress that you're making and we hope this goes on and on. But certainly you are preparing our kids for tomorrow. You know, Ellen Roosevelt once wrote that the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. We know these young people have dreams unimaginable. We know that they will go on to college to wherever they go and realize hopefully those goals that they have set for themselves. And much of that will be because they have had the opportunity to be exposed to this particular program. And I am absolutely delighted as I said before to be a part of the Samuel DuVois Cook Center on social equity. Sam was one of our dear friends. His wife is still one of our dear friends. His family is a dear, dear family to us. And we are honored beyond words to be a part of the Duke family who would have thought it. I never thought it. But here is my name on this program here at Duke University, a little black girl from housing Texas. Never knew that this could happen. And what can I say? Thank you. And the final set of comments comes from my dear friend. We are, we tend to root for slightly different teams when it comes to basketball. But on behalf of the Cook family, Sam Jr. Mr. Reginald Dean. Thank you so much for your kind words regarding my father and as well as your inspirational message. Dr. Dairity, Dr. Wright, Mrs. Billy Aaron, staff members of the Cook Center, students, parents, teachers, and Duke University. The Cook family would like to offer a heartfelt thank you for another amazing summer program. We would like to offer a special congratulations to the students that have been accepted to and participate in the Hank and Billy Super Aaron Young Scholars Summer Research Institute. The, the excellence exhibited by all of you has been awe inspiring. One day it will be up to all of you to save the world, I believe. I also believe that you are young, gifted, and are on your way to becoming future leaders and role models. I know one day my children will look up to you. And one day other young children will seek to emulate the work that you have done and the excellence that you have provided. Thank you again to the Cook Center for another wonderful summer at Duke University. I believe that concludes our ceremony this evening. So as we usually say, eat, drink, and be merry. You",

        "transcript": " Here's Jamie Henshaw. How is everybody? I love all your faces. Good to see everybody, like old friends here. So today we're going to talk a little bit about movies, a fun subject, kind of going back to the beginning of time and to the ancient gods. Because what we're seeing now is that people in Hollywood and the industry is being worshiped like it is religion. And it actually takes from religion. And so let's just get right into it. Because Hollywood is really, when you look at it closely, it's a religion of its own. And it's actually a composite of ancient religions called the mysteries. And we will see how the ancient priests banded together to form exclusive secret societies who performed sacred dramas at stated periods in time. And many of the mystery schools chose plays as a path of initiation. So there were varying degrees and many levels of priesthoods as most magical orders have hierarchies. But these priests were born into families of priests and priestesses. And they assumed the destiny of their family bloodline when their predecessors died. So secrets were told within families about the mystery teachings and the rights and passages of initiation things that common people never were privy to that kind of information. So outsiders were only permitted to join after a long course of study and fasting and ritual and a lifetime of dedication. And sometimes these initiation rituals could be extremely cruel. So there's a good quote that I found about the beginning of the idea of play acting and actors invoking gods into themselves to portray on the stage for people to watch. So it says the earliest gods were invoked by a ritual act, the dromenon, meaning the thing done, such as a sacrificial dance, commemorating the fact that our life begins and ends when the gods call upon us. And subsequently the thing was said as well as done and the dromenon was on its way to becoming the drama. So once speech within the temple precincts had been endowed with the power of word magic, we have the invocation properly so-called. So these first plays were like I said, just people thinking that they actually were invoking the god or goddess on the planet. So these initiations, these theatrical performances were the mysteries of the universe were supposedly revealed to the initiate and he himself played a role. And in the one example that I have is the third or sublime degree of free masonry where the candidate plays the role of Grandmaster Heimrambith. And this is from the movie From Hell on the left and then you see a pink at a VMA award. And so he's got his hoodwink on his cable toe, his pant leg rolled up in his chest-beard and then you can see pink doing the exact same thing at the VMAs. So in the golden age of Hollywood around the late 1920s or the mid 1940s, the film industry had actually operated under the studio system. And this means that certain companies control practically every process of the actor's life, they control the filmmaking, the production, the distribution, the exhibition. So they were just like a powerhouse of their own. And so although you'll hear a lot of people talk about how the Jews run Hollywood or whatever it's actually more of a compositive, secret societies. And one of these they actually operate in is the mason's. And so the most powerful Hollywood moguls in the beginning that 20th Century Fox and WB, Jack Warner, Warner Brothers, Darryl Zannick, Louis B. Mayer of MGM, Paramount Pictures, Carl. Somebody told me how to pronounce this. I don't know if you're here. Is Lemmally. I was Lemmally? Yeah. Okay, so in addition to them being the Hollywood moguls, they were also remasons. And this is the L-Cappy-10 Theatre in downtown Hollywood. It's across the street from the Codex Center where they have the Academy Awards. And this was actually a masonic building before Disney bought it. And right next door they have Jimmy Kimmel Live in the old masonic temple. And so they are always like mixing new corporations and with masonic traditions. So also it's kind of reflected the importance of Masonry and Holly was reflected in that the Academy Awards used to be held at the Shrine Auditorium, which is owned by the Scottish Rite. So many of the rituals of Freemasonry, they're actually based on trials that candidates were subjected to by the ancient hero fonts during initiation. And it is believed that Harambiff was an initiate of the Dionysus architects and builders. And so here we have Dionysus. And this is from the Disney movie Hercules. And it's funny because Dionysus is the ultimate god of party and revelry. And he was actually called the god that comes. So you can see some innuendos right here in the photo. What's he doing at Hercules right there? But it's true that many of these ancient mystery schools were centered around sex. And so the Dionysian mysteries they use drugs and other trans-inducing techniques such as dance and music to remove the inhibitions and social constraints for the purpose of what they think to return the individual to their animalistic beast like state. And so basically they were always constantly pushing the boundaries of what was considered taboo. And the initiation rituals from Emma Puberty were for the purpose of identifying the males as the god Dionysus as the sexy drunken character. And then they even had initiation rituals for women where the young girl would have to become the bride of Dionysus. But so if you thought that Miley Cyrus's current behavior was a little inappropriate you should have seen the shenanigans going on in the mystery schools in ancient Greece. Because there was nothing new under the sun and this is just it's all happened before and now it's coming back to happen in the public eye. So in the Roman mythology like I said Dionysus became Bocchus and he's the ultimate party god. And so that's why like a drunken orgy is still called a Bocchanalia. And for good reason because these people would whip themselves into a frenzy of intoxication and in the spring women would attend their secret ceremonies in their name and because he was the god of fertility right. And he had this divine role as a liberator of morality. And his wild and like untamed nature is a lot of times depicted as a large predatory cat. So it's interesting now that in the popular culture hermaphroditic symbolism is coming out a lot. Transgenders a big issue right now because Dionysus himself was actually imagined as hermaphrodite. And if he wore any clothes at all they were a feminine and his springtime festivals included cross dressing. And these large cats are also associated with Hercules who in the mythos is a lover of Dionysus. And they were often depicted in drinking contest and brawling and love making and things like that. So these Dionysian mysteries like many other mystery schools consisted of two sets of rights. And these were the secret rights of initiation and the public rights. And so for Greece and Rome the stage was a sacred place where they were invoking the gods right. And where the dramaturgical interactions of the gods were the form of magical invocation. And so these actors would down the costumes of the gods and the playwright scripting the narrative would indoctrinate the masses into the appropriate morals of the state. Or what they thought were the appropriate morals right. So it was in the beginning of theater there were two kinds of people the initiates and the profane. So there were in other words there were those that get it and those that don't. And so in the world of Harry Potter you have the magicians and the Muggles. So it's the people who can see what's being acted in front of them and the people who it goes right over their heads. So every pagan nation it had like not only its state religion but the religion that the illuminated ones gained entrance. And so since these initiates thought themselves to be physically and morally superior to everyone else they believe that the masses had to be led like a flock of sheep and taught what to think in a single simple language. So public plays were highly sponsored by the aristocratic class but only the discerning few knew the esoteric message while the majority received only the literal interpretation. And the opinions of the masses the crowd were shaped by play acting and drama and stories and tales and myths and this is an early example of social engineering. So we were talking yesterday about the Hollywood and actually that's an interesting point and I put it in the book is that the symbol of the oak tree is something that the druids used to worship their supreme deity, druids were very skilled magicians. So during legend in druidism about the battle of the oak king and the holly king and the oak king controls the light half of the year and the holly king the dark side. And so both of these are kind of identified with the god pan who I talk about a lot in weird stuff part two. And the holly trees what they would use to make magic ones from and even jk rolling has acknowledged this when she says that Harry Potter's one is made of hollywood and a phoenix feather which the phoenix is a bird of that's associated with mystery schools right. So she says it's made of a hollywood and a phoenix feather which is also very important symbol. I gave Harry a wand made of hollywood back in 1990 when I first drafted chapter six of philosopher stone. It was not an arbitrary decision holly has certain connotations that were perfect for Harry particularly when contrast traditional associations of you from which bolder morts wand is made. So yeah the holly has always been thought to have supernatural powers. So let's talk about hollywood royalty a little bit and royalty royalty which is gross but today the masses the worship celebrities the way that the ancient people worship the gods. And many even make pilgrimages to the holy land of hollywood to you know in hopes to see their deities in the flesh. And for some people you know life changing movies such as Star Wars or the Matrix is the closest thing to a spiritual experience that they will ever have. So you may have noticed how often we see celebrities and world leaders walking upon these red carpets right just like they do at the academy awards. And this is a motif representing the blood path or the blood line coming down from the past and running into the future and along with winning politicians. So many celebrities happen to be descended from royalty. So now I feel like there's another revolution taking place in America it's a royal revolution. Looking at the tabloids and the media coverage of royal families and princess programming for young girls and pop culture's current obsessions for all things of the monarchy. I mean how many times do we go to buy our groceries and look at the tabloids and it's all Prince William and Kate Middleton and Queen of England and all these royals right who gives a crap. But you know it's almost like the revolutionary war never happened at all because you know 240 years ago people were dying so they didn't have to give a crap what the royal family was doing. So we could all think of ourselves as sovereign and not have to worship these leaders right. So from the coverage of the royal families to the cross generational appeal of the royal fairytale wedding. These kings and queens have reconquered us quietly using children's cartoons and pop music. And here I have an example of just one tiny example of the royalty programming that's going on in pop culture. This is Katie Perry's new perfume called Killer Queen. And you can take that for what you will. But let's talk a little bit about how the idea of royalty and the kingship even came into our consciousness as a species. So understanding the paradigm of this Hollywood royalty programming will take us all the way back to the beginning of civilization and the leading deities of the Sumerian creation were the sky god on you the earth goddess and the air god and the water god and so they were like primordial representations of natural forces right. But there is a lot of evidence to suggest that they were also sort of super natural giant humanoid flying beings that came and meddled in people's lives and affairs and when they would arrive the people's eyes would stare at them. And these are some gypsum figurines that they found in Iraq and these would actually stand in for worshipers worshiping the gods at the altar and this is how they portrayed people looking at the gods with eyes this big right. So the Sumerian people they tended to take a kind of tragic view of mankind and his fate and his destiny they weren't very optimistic about being on the planet at all. They believed that the gods made man from clay and created them for a single purpose which was to serve the gods by supplying them with food, drink and shelter so that they might have leisure for their divine activities. And in ancient Assyrian philosophy creation was considered as the covenant between heaven and earth as long as the humans served the gods until their death. And so have you ever wondered why certain families of the world they claim imminent rulership over the rest of humanity and make it their life's purpose to produce male airs to the throne and keep their bloodlines pure. Here's a fact that goes right over most people's heads is that most of the world's royal families will trace their lineage back to a supernatural ancestor. So I'm thinking of King Arthur and his myth right and so the first kings like I'll get to in a second Gilgamesh he thought that he was two thirds god. And so they say that their their kingship their divine right to rule was let down from heaven meaning that these early beings that men considered gods they would have their city states that was dedicated to the one god and they were often at war with each other. And so Babylonian and Mesopotamian kings they legitimize themselves through the fact that they came from ancient ruling families these ancient aliens gods Nephilim you know you can fill in the blank with your own understanding about that but they were beings that were not human that were creating civilization. And so these kings they would emphasize the fact that they came from the eternal seed and even the word on Unaki means a princely seed. And so if you've ever heard of the word on Unaki before you know what I'm talking about but according their history the gods created the king directly following the creation of humans so that he could guide the humans correctly. And one of the first cities in the world was called Ruk and one of his kings was the renowned Gilgamesh and Gilgamesh like I said he thought of himself as two thirds god and one third man and his mortality is the conflict of the epic of Gilgamesh which is one of the oldest texts that's ever been discovered in the world probably the first book ever written. And he was always very vexed because he was part human and only the gods live forever and he wanted to live forever so in Gilgamesh's character we see somewhat of a person who is obsessed with fame and intense preoccupation with his reputation and sort of a revolt against his part man nature. And then on the other slide next to him is Enki-Du which Enki-Du was a sort of beast master who was born with the wild animals and in the story they want to tame him so that he can be a companion to Gilgamesh because Gilgamesh is wearing out the humans with his decrees and his ruling that all the brides had to first be with him on their wedding night before they could be with their husband. So the people of the summer were like we need help so they go to the gods and the gods create Enki-Du so that Gilgamesh could have somebody to wrestle with and preoccupy him. And Enki-Du was actually subdued in the story from the wilderness to come to the city to be friends with Gilgamesh by a prostitute. So we'll get into prostitution in just a second. But the tales of these ancient gods, it proves that they were never benevolent all knowing all loving deities only that they were physically and technologically superior. So they were given to all manner of earthly desires and emotions and competitiveness, hunger, fear, jealousy, sadness, anger and love. Their contention and their empire building and their city state building were the driving force behind early civilization and human beings in these stories were simply caught in the middle under the will of the gods. And under them were the priests. So we were talking about the priesthood a little bit before and the temples of the gods were always in the heart of the city and that's what the city was built around. And they were served by a perpetual priesthood and these were the writers, teachers, scholars, astrologers. And this priest class was almost the most elite class because they dictated the religion. So a priest could be above a king because he had the spiritual power. And so almost all of the temporal power of society was in the hands of the priests of these mystery schools and the estates that they managed which was the entire city almost. So this is Inana. And this is the Sumerian goddess who overshadowed and outlasted all of the other gods at the time. She was the goddess with a thousand names and a thousand incarnations and she was worshiped in a great temple in a root along with the father of the gods on you. And she was known as the Queen of Heaven, both an awful and lovely goddess of love, war, sex and death. She is probably the most important goddess of the entire history and we'll get into why I think that this is what's being incarnated through popular culture at this time. So she was always depicted as both a shy virgin and also essentialist mistress and she was a powerful warrior who drove a chariot drawn by lions, which were her sacred animal. And it's interesting at the beginning of time you have these hunter-gatherers that are just starting to form towns and cities and things and then you have the arrival of these beings and then you have a ziggurat. So it's like how did these people go from living in mudhuts to building ziggurats and accomplishing great feats of architecture and it was the arrival of these beings and that they're depicting right here. And so they came to love the city and more than nature and more than wilderness. I mean the Sumerians if you read their testimonies they loved civilization more than Kerry Racheau loves New York City. It's the same idea, this metropolis, the idea of getting everybody together, concentrated so that they're more easily controllable and that they don't get the divine energies from the nature that they're supposed to be getting because we're all surrounded by buildings and bricks and streets and cars and everything that disconnects us from God and creation. So in Anna's strongest culture in the cities that were most notable for trade such as Phoenicia were also remastered comes from and they despise the wilderness and their definition of a wicked and a person was an uncivilized person who lived in the mountains and didn't practice agriculture. So it was in fact it was an honor herself who was most responsible for civilization as we know it in the first place because there is a story where an honor horizon or a ruckus city and she arrives with these objects they call the May, it's called a pronounced May but it's spelled M.E. And these were the various types of supernatural objects and ideas that amounted to civilization so where does the idea of real estate come from? King ship, let's see the list here, says the May is a set of rules and regulations assigned to each cosmic entity and cultural phenomenon for the purpose of keeping it operating forever. So the way that she obtains the May is in a very Luciferian way and you can almost say that in Anna has a lot in common with Lucifer because he was the one that took the fire from God and brought it down back to earth for mankind to enlighten him. But in this story she is called the Holy Torch which is also a symbol of Lucifer and she was anxious to increase the welfare and prosperity of a ruck and make it the center of civilization, the center of the world. And so she goes to the realm of the gods and she gets drunk with Enky, one of the creator gods and he gives her the May and says these are yours and you can take these back to your city and so basically you are the queen of earth now because you have the set of rules for governing humanity. So in this list there is like almost 100 things listed including crowns, tiaras, the throne, the staff, the measuring rod in line you can see on the right side she is holding like a circle in a bar. So this is how they would measure off real estate for agriculture and planting as they would take a stick and put it in the ground and then tie a rope around it very easy way to, you know, portion off pieces of land for real estate and ownership. She also brought the idea of priests and priestesses, she brought the idea of the sacred marriage of weapons, ceremonial robes, hairstyle, love making, I mean the list goes on and on. Music, the art of the hero, metal working, fire, so there you go. So she brought fire to mankind. So yeah, the May were the Samaritan values and governing structures that organized their society and they were conferred by the gods onto the king priest who was supposed to be like the god on earth and he was the representative of the god on earth and it was his job to ensure the continuation of the civilization the way that the gods saw fit. So, and on as may also included public love making and the kissing of the phallus and temple prostitution and these were ritualistically performed during their New Year's festivals in the spring and autumn called the Akitu. And so imagine coming out twice a year to see your neighbors going at it on the designated day because this was the day for fertility and this all came the idea of doing this in public came from these ancient gods. So, you know, if you were Samaritan you might not have been so shocked at what you were seeing on television today because maybe it was nothing compared to back then. But there's a good quote here it says our own demographic is very strange in comparison to the usual experience of humankind young people move to the cities of their own free will so their cities were essentially young adult societies. The closest modern comparison would be the mid 1960s when the baby boomers came of age when the baby boomers were young adults the elderly still were not living that long and birth control became readily available. It was the age of sex drugs and rock and roll it was similar to Samarian society. So, the Canadians of Mesopotamia they incorporated the Samarian culture wholesale and melded their goddess ishtar I mean Anana with ishtar. And so the identification of these two goddesses was partly due to Sargon the great a great king not a great one but. Important one. Who conquered Sumer and most of western Asia and so to help him control the restless and rebellious populations of the Samarian cities he appointed his daughter as high priestess and spouse of the moon god. Her and of the sky god in a rook and so for 40 years she held this priestly office and will the great power among the Mesopotamians and she elevated the Anana ishtar hybrid as the supreme goddess of the empire and gave her the rank the queen of heaven. And she is remembered today primarily as the first poet in recorded history who actually has a name was a woman. So it was at this time that the insatiable ambition of kings was transformed from the idea of winning the favor of the goddess of love and war to rule their city states into one of more of a world domination. And so ishtar had been worship by sacred prostitution in her earlier incarnation as Anana the practice reached its height in Babylon which is why the goddess is remembered in Christian mythology as the horror Babylon. And so besides the many time full time temple horrors that they had working there. The act of this sacred prostitution they told them that it was a way for women to identify with the goddess and receive her blessing and fertility and for men to be blessed by the conjugation with Anana's representative. And so this type of religious sexuality might sound glamorous but it is highly unlikely that the prostitutes were voluntary. You know prostitution is slavery. I don't think anyone is going to argue that but they try to make it as glamorous and sexy and desirable and not as shameful as we all know it is. And so what I have here is a medieval representation of the horror Babylon on her great dragon with the heads and you know the beast of the abyss and it's actually Lady Gaga. I don't know if I should throw this in but if you are more interested in learning about that we did a very good special on the Katy Perry Super Bowl ritual when she arrived in the Super Bowl on time. And so the top of the line which is Anana's animal holding the reins in a flaming dress just like the last card from Alistair Crowley. So if you are more interested in that I would suggest you check it out. But Ishtar was referred to as the goddess who could change men into women and vice versa. So androgynous priests and priestesses were called Reed people and they served in temples as seers of the divine. And so the people with a typical sexuality were given special status in ancient summer and were thought to have abilities of supernatural religious value. And so the Mesopotamian interpretation of Ishtar is a gender bender and as the morning star Venus is her planet and in the morning it is male in the evening is female. And so this could be a reason why we are seeing this trend of mixing the genders together because I think that they're trying to incarnate these ideas from the beginning of time. So ancient people were fascinated by her maverites. The spring Akitou festival along with the public ritual of the sacred marriage that was performed by the king and the priestess of Anana. They also had a parade of crosswrest dressed worshipers who would wear half men and half woman costumes. And so with a devotional ceremony they would honor Anana and rejoin themselves to her light. And so Androgynous clothing was symbolic of the goddess and they believed that she existed as the opposite sex in each person. So taverns were also brothels and they were sacred to the goddess and sex with a prostitute like we were talking before was a religious sanctioned activity. And this gets pretty dark because boys and girls became prostitutes as children because they were raised in this and only allowed to exit the poor house and serve in other capacities when they reached adulthood. So temple prostitution was so common in the ancient world that there are many specific verses in the Bible that actually condemn this practice. So by the Iron Age, Ishtar was well integrated into the pantheon of most religions. And so all goddesses that you see springing up through history, you can trace them back to Anana. And on the left you see a statue that they found and these were actually rigged with water so they would spout water from that little hole that she's holding right there. And so throughout the literature in the Bronze Age, kings declared that they were the lovers of Anana Ishtar and the story of the courtship of Anana and Dhammuzi established the principle of the sacred marriage for fertility. And it was the relationship between the king and the goddess that was the king's source of power. So human kings of Aruch, they claimed legitimacy to the throne by their emulation of Dhammuzi who was Anana's husband and her is favorable relationship with her. So here the high priestess would unite with the king of the land who represented Dhammuzi and this important festival like we were talking about with last for many days and occur around the time of the autumn equinox. So the cult of priests, they really benefited from preserving the sacred marriage rituals because this legitimized new kings coming into conquer. So when a new king would come and conquer the city instead of being slaughtered, the priests would come out and say it's Anana's will that you have won this battle. You can have our city as long as you keep our ritual and continue to have the sacred fertility public ritual for the people. You're the new king as long as you're making love to Anana and public and so it's kind of a win-win for whoever won that city, right? But what does this have to do with Hollywood? Here's another picture of this is called the Investiture of Zimri Lim, King Zimri Lim and you can see Anana passing the divine right of rulership with the rod and the circle right there to Zimri Lim. So Hollywood has been associated with ancient Babylon since its very inception and during the onset of the Great Depression many Americans believe that the country's financial hardships were the result of a moral decline. So they were harping a lot on Hollywood and blaming Hollywood for the ills of the country and they called it Babylon in Sin City. And so really no ancient city is more famous for its mysteries than Babylon because it literally means gate of the gods. And this is Marduk. And this is from a cartoon called I Am the City from the Real Ghost Busters and we'll talk a little bit more about Marduk in a second. But Babylon was very much like Los Angeles in the ancient world as the important center of popular culture. And it's not surprising that the astrology and the star chart comes from Babylon and in the ancient times the Zigarat of Edtaman Tanki towered over the city and it was ruled by the God King Marduk. That is just a cartoon but you can go and look at ancient depictions of Marduk but he, let's see. So things kind of changed a little bit when Babylon became the center because the right and rituals switched from the focal point being Anana and the King in the Sacred Marriage Ritual from that to Marduk gaining power over the gods and becoming the King of the gods and the King of Babylon at the same time. So here is the Kodak Theater in the center of downtown Hollywood and Highland. And this opened in 2001 and it is the permanent home of the Academy Awards. And so this is where the Hollywood royalty parades down the red carpet on their way to receiving the Oscars. And the decor is taken from the 1916 movie intolerance by a Freemason who is DW Griffith. And the ancient Babylonian story in the movie depicts the conflict between Prince Belches, our Babylon and Cyrus the Great of Persia. And in the film the intolerant priests of Marduk who is also called Bell attempt to suppress the worship of Ishtara and betray their King. And that's the old movie that this is taken from but this is also an interesting arch in itself because this is the Babylon courtyard they call it and they have four story columns top with standing elephants. And if you look through there you can actually see the Hollywood sign in the background. So on either side of the arch are two curious characters the figure on the left holding the basin of water is similar to the winged genie of a Syrian iconography and they appear in the reliefs and walls throughout palaces and temples in various ways. And this one is actually on the left I would say that this is Enki or Ia because he was always depicted as a god of water who held a pot of water in his hands or with streams of water erupting from his body. And the creature on the right by the better one. Yeah, there's a Syrian eagle god named Nuskou who was originally depicted as holding a pine cone like object. And I guess you can see it a little bit in here they've kind of in the originals it's a lot bigger and more pronounced but they've kind of shrunk his little pine cone in his hand. But he is the messenger of Marduk and a god of the stylus. So then the squiggly thing between them. This is the Syrian tree of life and this was the original tree of life thousands of years before the Kabbalah depending on which tradition you describe to. But there appears to be a general consensus among experts that this tree was related to creation and fertility and it's a representation of the human body and the ideal man. And it also refers to the organization of the material world by Marduk and the king is portrayed as the human personification of the tree and in some representations the king actually takes the place of the tree of life. So the grand entrance into the city of Babylon was called the Ishtar gate and it's made with blue bricks and deck rated with approximately 120 lions and which is why it's sometimes called the lion's gate. And it was excavated in the 20th century and reconstructed in a museum and it's now at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin that's where you can find this thing. And so during the celebrations of these New Year's Akeetu festivals statues of the deities were created paraded through the gate and down the processional way for everyone to worship and isn't interesting that so many film companies have this lion motif. There's lion's gate films. There's a lion's gate actually brought us the twilight and the hunger games and American psycho and all of these negative movies. But I just thought that was very interesting that you know the lion's gate of Babylon and now you have the lion's gate production company, right. So this is in Hollywood and then you can see the little wing genie in the king only in Los Angeles. Can you visit a Syrian ziggurat and buy a corporate crap at a discount? This is an outlet mall. The Citadel outlet mall in Commerce, California is built in 1929 and this is a replica of the fortress of Der Sharuken of Sargon the second and complete with all the battle scenes, the wing genie, the wing bulls and the human head guys called the Lamasu. The Syrians were very hated. They were one of the most fearsome and warlike and barbaric civilizations that we've ever studied in history. So they tell us of their bloodthirst and sadism and their perfection at war. So having an Assyrian themed outlet mall is kind of like having a Nazi themed farmers market. It doesn't make sense. But. So let's talk about sorcery for a second because if it only takes six degrees to get to Kevin Bacon in Hollywood, it takes even less to get to Alistair Crowley and Salima in my opinion is the hidden religion of the 20th century. And Hollywood is one of the main epicenters for global sorcery and mind control. And so movies are magical ceremonies and their mode of operation is mimicry or sympathy. And some directors know exactly the potent magic power of movies and use it to enlighten or enslave depending on the makers. So two hours in front of the screen watching movie like the Matrix could sufficiently initiate even the most naive person to the level of the first degree of a cult apprentice if they realize what they're watching. So Alistair Crowley's religion and if you saw in the beginning of the very first slide that was from the Game of Thrones and that is their religion in that show. And it has this same seal of Babylon. So we were talking about Anana, Ishtar, Korobablon. This is what the goddess is turning into now. They're using a fellow mites believe that their goddess Babylon is a composite of Kali and Ishtar and the Korobablon from Revelation. So his motto of do with that will is the anthem of the music industry if you listen closely. And even though he died nearly penniless and fighting a heroin addiction his legacy is nevertheless nothing short of colossal. So it's a sign of the Holy Spirit and it's a sign of the Holy Spirit that was created by Alistair Crowley and it was created by Elrond Hubbard who was a protégé of Kroly and who took hypnosis and black magic and made it into a long drawn out an expensive torture session. So a sign of the Holy Spirit would not be nearly as successful as it is today without its celebrity endorsements. So in the same way it is believed that the history of humanity can be divided into a series of aons and each was accompanied by its own forms of magical and religious expression. And the book of the law is divided into three sections and talking about the An of Isis, the An of Osiris and the An of Horus which is what they believe that we are in right now, the An of Horus. This is supposed to be the idea of there's no such thing as sin because Horus is like a selfish child god. And so even the very idea of something being sinful they would tell you is a lie and an obstacle to your self-fulfillment and instead each person will be governed by their own self-will and self-interest. The Feminine Counter Part II Horus is where we're talking about the Scarlet Woman, the Babel on BAB, A. L. O. N. And Alex Kroly was very sexist and held to all the misogynistic notions of the Victorian era. He was struggling against excessive repression and never really treated women as anything but sexual playthings and he wanted them to behave like nymphomaniacs. He only ever used the women in his life for sex or money or both and most of the women who got involved with him ended up mentally or suffering drug addiction. And so on the left is one of his Scarlet women who he would actually brand with a haw iron on their chest, his version of the Mark of the Beast, the circle and the cross. And then you have a lady Gaga in there as the Scarlet Woman which they will dress them in red. You will notice after an initiation or a big performance they will always re-emerge as the Scarlet Woman. So they call their goddess Babel on the mother of abominations. And yeah her god form is based on this like we were talking about the sacred horror ishtar. And it is believed that she could be in a vote to earth and her role could be filled by actual women as the counterpart to his self as the great beast and help manifest the energies of what they want in this a-anaphors. So Aleister Kroly he actually believed that many of his lovers were playing this role to the fulfillment of his prophecy. And the Thelmaids believe that the Scarlet Woman as well as the role of the beast can be fulfilled by any magician who so chooses. So this is what I think that they're trying to put on these girls who are under monarch mind control. And when they get deeper in it they're actually elevated to the level of a Scarlet Woman. So some people will try to whitewash Kroly is a kind of harmless libertarian dumbledore kind of figure but the morals outlined in his teachings contain statements that from a humanitarian point of view are way more than objectionable. And his book is anti-compassion, anti-democracy, anti-emotion, anti-sympathy, pity or brotherly love. And so the chief concern of a Thelmaid is following their own individual true will. And so nowhere in the book of the law are you instructed to be concerned with the rights of others. And if the doing of your will includes hurting someone else or thwarting their rights then so be it the might makes right that's the idea of this whole religion. And not only that they consider whoever can win is deserving and they even have a dictum the slaves shall serve. So in occult terms Thelmaid is a dichotomous seeing himself as a superior being or a chosen one and while everyone else is nothing. And the concept of following one's true will takes no account for the fact that we exist in an ecosystem and it's not a universe unto ourselves because we're showing the space with everyone else in the real world damage to others and your environment equals damage to yourself because we all have to share the space. So the book of the law is actually based on social Darwinian feudal stratification and this is what we're talking about royalty programming. It's the princess and the commoner right and the peasant. So Crowley, Crowley belonged to an elite class. He was born with money and this dictated his view of the world and including his view of an ideal world. And he's one passage revolves around the idea that the slaves shall serve forever. He says, yeh, deem not change. You shall be as you are and not other. Therefore the kings of the earth shall be kings forever. The slave shall serve. There is none that shall be cast down or lifted up all is as it ever was. So here the his feudal ideas are in full force and what he's saying is there are kings and wealthy people and there are slaves and beggars and nothing in the Lima or Hollywood or monarchy is designed to change this paradigm. There is no promise that slaves will be set free or that beggars will become rich. So to them the person is either one or the other and they give no reason for believing why this should ever change to them. So he actually said there is only one solution to pick out the diamonds from the clay, cut them, polish them and set them as they deserve. You will observe that I am advocating an aristocratic revolution. And so I am. And remember that Katy Perry royal revolution, right? So his ideal government must lord over and manage hordes of ignorant masses. He said we should have no compunction in utilizing the natural qualities of the bulk of mankind. We do not insist on trying to train sheep or hunt foxes or lecture on history. We look after their physical well being and enjoy their wool and mutton. In this way we shall have a contented class of slaves who accept the conditions of existence as they really are and enjoy life without the quiet with the quiet wisdom of a cattle. So here is a photo from Bohemian Grove. And you can see behind them this is the representation of their ideal society. So you have a priest in front with a staff and like a Pope-like figure. And then you have the banker, a aristotic class, and then you have the servants who serve them. And then you have the businessmen and on and on until you get down to peasants. And you know, this is the way that they feel that society should be run. And Hollywood is their major mode of indoctrination to make you think that this is true also. So through these art and artifacts, the ancient kings, they really revealed themselves to be militant and pompous imperialist who thought nothing of deporting entire tribes. Or torturing prisoners of war to build their kingdoms like Babylon and Aruch. And base released from the cities of Nimrod and Nineveh featuring kings conquering armies, strutting, slaughtering, leading thousands of people, deporting them, making them build these buildings. So whenever you see these great giants. Okay, good. And you see these feats of architecture just remember that it was built on the back of real people. And this is actually the picture is from what is it? King Sinacarib of Assyria. And even in the writings he glots and says, I deported them and made and carried the head pet and molded bricks and subjected them to my slavery. Slavery was a recognized institution from the beginning of time. And even in messimtamous society. And so these temples, palaces and richest states were owned and exp- owned by the Magician priest class and they exploited slaves in their temple prostitution. So if we want to see how the Babylon system is working today, you know, look no further than Hollywood because this is the spell that, you know, ancient people used to use the stars to navigate and to tell time and to, you know, to follow the stars was how you got from one place to the other. But now they have everybody looking at these stars in Hollywood who they created instead of the actual stars. So when they were owned by the studio system that was also a sort of form of slavery, you know, the studio did as much as possible, even dictating social activities, even down to who a certain star would marry. If a star was gay, they would have to get a fake wife. So they pretty much controlled every aspect of these actor and actresses life. So I guess that it's on the left. You can see Sargon in anana again and they're standing on the backs of slaves. And free your mind, I think, is one of the best places to combat this slavery and we're learning all about trauma-based mind control and we're learning about, you know, just the... Okay. All the different ways that our mind is enslaved and so what we have to do first is to start to free our mind. Oh, okay. And it starts by freeing your mind and it starts by sharing it with other people and so don't let this kind of information get you lonely. I wrote these books so that you would have a tool to share in a way that's easy to get people to understand what you're trying to tell them. It's full-color pictures and it was written for the demographic I was thinking was teenagers because I think that, you know, children are the future and we have to educate them in real things instead of just Hollywood and fake school. So I really hope you enjoyed my talk and I hope you will check out my book.",

It's a treat for me to bring her with me. Abby is here. Hello everybody. I'm Aaron Beane. I know many of you. I'm a member of the chamber. I'm a small business owner. I've had the privilege of, Shmarion, the privilege of serving you as your state representative. For many years, eight years we've had a great relationship. We had office hours, regular office hours on the west side. We did great things together. If Mayor Graham was here, who endorsed us, would tell you about the waste water sewage project. So when we flushed the toilet right here, know that it's gone forever. The work we did together, that was the chamber in the Callahan city, City of Callahan in your state government. Now my opponent will call that an earmark. Can you imagine him calling it an earmark? There are so many good things. He's confused. Washington, DC, politics with local government in the state of Florida. Those are called community budget requests. And you know those are extremely important to our community. I am proud of the record. And there are dozens of things that we have worked together, including improving our schools. You know one of the bills I did. I'm just taking one of the bills we did was fixing the A-plus education plan where it didn't recognize schools that were all together. Brycefield goes to school all together and they get rewarded when they're an A-plus school. But schools that are apart, like M-A-Love, doesn't get rewarded before those A-plus. We fixed that. That was something that we fixed. Here's where I need your help guys. I need your help. I'm in a tight race. It's a foreign burner out there. Truly what you do for me can make a huge difference. I'm going to put it right now. His claim to fame is that he's from Jacksonville. He is at an event I'm sure in Jacksonville. He says it's a Jacksonville seat. That's what he says. And I beg to differ. And I think the people of Nassau County beg that differ as well. The seat, yes it's Nassau and Duval County. Most of Duval County is a little bit different. But if we're going to have a shot, I need your help. I need you not only to devote for me. I ask for your vote today. Any more? How about that? I'm going to push the envelope and ask for more. I need you to reach out to others to say Aaron V needs our help. Can you support him? Can you take a yard sign? Can you reach out to somebody in Jacksonville to say Aaron V. Not only represented Nassau County well, but represented five other counties at the same time. So yes, we will be here representing you like we've always had. We will be fighting for conservative ideals. We will be fighting for those same community projects that we've always fought for. And I've got an eight year track record of bringing them home to Nassau County. I will continue to do that. But also I will continue to make sure that we live within our means. That we have conservative ideas. Let me tell you some good news. I think we're announcing today. The NRA is going to come out with an endorsement of Aaron V. We're proud of that record and proud of the United Sportsmen of Florida. We will come out for Aaron V with their endorsement and their rating of me. But I need your help. I need your help and would love to have your support. There's so much I want to say and I'm looking at my time. It's gone away. So it's Aaron V. I've got yard signs. Aaron V. Aaron V. Aaron V. Aaron V. If you have any thoughts or questions or Aaron, you need to be there. We're walking. We're totally committed to doing everything we can. We're going to be outspent by our opponent. But we will not be outwork or out doorknought. And that's my commitment to you. So join me. Join Aaron V. And the whole being team. And let's win this thing. Thank you very much. Have a great day.",

        "transcript": " Here it is. A very good afternoon Patriots. It is great to be with you and thank you so much for allowing me to bring your state senator. It's a dream and honor to serve you. Ladies and gentlemen, I can say, I would say welcome to the Reagan West Side barbecue. I can say welcome to the front lines of saving our country. I can say you are one and that's where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen. You are truly barricaded saying, be, what does eating barbecue have to do with saving the country? Well, Neil Freeman will tell you he's right here on the second row. There are ten states. Ten states that are going to decide who takes the reins of our country. There's no bigger prize than Florida. Let me tell you, Florida is as purple as they come. South Florida, I spend some time in South Florida this week. It is a difference. It is a different, say no most in South Florida. It is blue. And the only way we can combine is what we do in North Florida. North East Florida, particular. That's what I want George Bush. I want other big races. That's what I want. Governor Scott was right here up in North East Florida. And so that's why we're hearing Barbecue. I look at my friend's share of life. I look at the chairman, Scott Wiley, other big drums and Jacksonville that are here today to say, let's do it as a team. We know George Florida works together as a team. The in no 95 million people are out of the workforce. Thanks to our current leadership and the White House. Do you know that one in five households, one in five households right now, is no longer seeking a paycheck from employment. Those are both all time high records. And this week, a new job report came out and said, we created 38,000 new jobs. So let me ask you, National Accounting, how so a bomb I care working for you now. It's a job killer. It's got to be our number one thing to reveal once we take back the White House. So we eat barbecue in National Accounting as everything to do with literally saving our country. She's out there, you know who I'm talking about. She's out there, ready to carry on the traditions of Obama and all that he stands for. Everything that's upside down in our country. So what's at stake is tremendous. You and your sphere of influence is going to be tremendous. You're saying, be not just one vote. Your sphere of influence is tremendous. We as a team have to pick off all those people that say, and there's still some out there, never somebody. We know that they need to be on our team. And there's so many independence. But I'll look at it and you'll be amazed that next cocktail party, backyard barbecue, or whatever, your conversation to say once that state for our country. Because the American experiment started over 225 years ago. And it's now in danger. It's now in danger. Our borders and things that we think of that our government is going to do. It's no longer enforced at all. In fact, our government's economy is actually pushing across the federal lines. And this, I'm not keeping you of all the things happening in our world right now. What is our federal government concerned with? I will kid you not. I'm housing for illegal transgender aliens. I can't you not. So much of this state ladies and gentlemen, and that's why we're here in barbecue. I want to give a shout out to all of our candidates. If you haven't joined these local candidates, I've been one. I am one. It means so much for you to give them this support. They are on the road. They're not going to own doors. It ain't a lot for you to have there. So with that, I also want to recognize he's going to be speaking in a few minutes. Our lieutenant government, let's get them to the big rock of applause they've done. Our lieutenant government, Carlos, go pass them. Everyone! Tony speaking to the two nationalists, it's going to see you run around. How about that? He flew in just for this event. So ladies and gentlemen, enjoy your barbecue and get charged up. You're going to eat that energy as we together save our country. Go out and have a great day to contribute to all of us.",

        "transcript": " Florida's elected leadership leaving the state and even the country. Local Senator Travis Hudson offers his reaction to the controversial cabinet meeting held in Israel. We'll also discuss the recently completed legislative session. First, the Mueller report back in the news because of Mueller himself. If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. The Constitution points to Congress to take action to hold the president accountable for his misconduct. Jacksonville's John Rutherford is a member of that Congress and he joins us to discuss the issue. Plus efforts underway to ease the red tape on legal immigrants and workers, one of the River City connections to Capitol Hill on this week in Jacksonville. And thanks so much for joining us today. The man who served a dozen years as your sheriff in DuVal County now in his second term as a U.S. representative from northeast Florida. Congressman John Rutherford is with us and we're going to talk about Robert Mueller and his statements this week and just a few moments. So I'd like to start with something that I know you are passionate about and that is our veterans. The veterans are in for success act, HR 2326. I understand it. Kind of modeled that after Operation the Uniform here in Jacksonville. Tell me about that, Bill. Listen, Kim, that was such a great program that we have operated right here in Jacksonville that I thought we needed to replicate that around the country and actually put dollars into the budget to help O&U actually be able to serve more people within Northeast Florida. Because the problem was they have like a 96% success rate in transitioning our veterans from service into the private industry and getting them jobs in a future. And so I wanted to replicate that because the challenge that they had was they were turning away literally hundreds a year that they simply didn't have the dollars to serve. Yeah, they just didn't have the dollars to serve. So veterans are for success act puts $10 million in a pot for matching grants that organizations like O&U or organizations and communities that want to start up in O&U can get those matching grants to help our service members transition from their military service in a private life. Just like they do here at O&U and they do such a great job. Michelle McMahon is just an amazing leader over there and I just wanted to replicate around the country what they're doing here. I know what when I've spoken to her, she's mentioned that you're a champion for our veterans. We've certainly seen that in legislation they've been introduced. No, you're champion. I should mention also that bill was just rolled up into the Mission Act and so it passed the House and hopefully we'll get signed in the law. And so past the House it's got to have a Senate component as well. Right. So the other thing I know you're passionate about, we hear you talk about transportation and what's been happening there. Vice President Mike Pence was just in Jacksonville not too long ago. Where do you stand when it comes to the administration and trade practices there that's certainly been a controversial thing during these last couple of years but Vice President here in town talking about that. Well the Vice President was in town talking about USMCA which is the US-Mexican-Canadian agreement which is the new NAFTA if you will. And look there's some really great things in the USMCA and I support the concept of the USMCA. However, what they left out of the USMCA is important to Florida. They are not addressing the needs of our seasonal produce growers and that is huge for the state of Florida. Everybody knows tourism is our number one economy. Our number two economy is our agriculture and I think the entire Florida delegation has made it pretty clear that if they want to get USMCA passed they're going to have to address this issue. Got to make some adjustments there yourself. Exactly. We cannot continue to allow Mexico to dump this seasonal produce that's driving our tomato farmers, cucumber farmers and others out of business. Yeah. I appreciate that. One of the things we wanted to talk about as well is what's going on with border security. Your law enforcement background, I know that's something that we've talked about in the past. We saw that the first new miles of a border wall under the Trump administration they're slated to be in construction in August. We just reported about that this week. What are your efforts right now? Is it complete support of whatever the administration says? You have some different ideas. How do we secure that border and make it safe? Yeah, let me tell you. I am working with a group of bipartisan members who want to get things done. It's called a bipartisan working group. And we are working on immigration and infrastructure right now. These are our two main focuses. But we have to have more bipartisanship in Washington. Look, we have too many members on the right and the left who are so concerned about these crazy scorecards that these different conservative or liberal organizations put out that they will vote for a bad bill and really vote to do nothing over fixing a problem. Now I give you a perfect example. Last session, we had Bob Gidlatt's bill out of Judiciary. Goodlatt too, they call it the final. That would have given us 25 billion to secure this other border. Now that involved building a wall, all the technology, all of the roads for infrastructure, additional boots on the ground because I don't care how good your surveillance is. You got to have men to put, men and women to put handcuffs on. All of it, 25 billion. We would have done away with chain migration. We would have brought in e-verified for the workers. All of that. In return, the Democrats wanted to have one point to actually the president kicked it up to 1.8 million, DACA dreamers who would as soon as that 25 billion was put in the lockbox, they would get legal permanent residency. Then once the border was secure, that way nobody could take the money away, once the border was secure, those 1.8 million DACA and dreamer kids would get green cards. And then they would go to the end of the line and work their way towards citizenship. Now in the meantime, if they joined the gang, if they committed crimes, there were a whole lot of reasons they could be thrown out of the country and have that green card taken away. It was probably a 10 or 15 year process for them to get citizenship. People in our own party, because they're worried about these score cards where somebody's going to say whether you're a conservative or not. Because of these score cards, our own people voted that thing down. We could have secured this border two years ago. But because of those ideologues, we didn't. And I had somebody ask me in part of Idra, and they said, Sheriff, what can we do to help you in DC? I said, never send another ID log to Washington. Send pragmatists. We got to get something done. And it always uses football analogy, where the ideologues want to throw a Hilmery pass on every play. If they don't get 100% of what they want, if they're not going to get a touchdown, they'd rather have nothing. Well, I'm not like that. And I told them. The pragmatist is running the ball. Yeah, get three yards, four yards. Get what you can. Move the ball down the field, but you have to get something done. Yeah. I used to tell them, look, when I was Sheriff, you think it was enough for me to stand in front of my community and say, I don't like crime? No, I had to do something about it. And so these ideologues are willing to just sit back and talk about it and worry more about their scorecard than really getting things done for the American public. Congressman, I want to keep talking with this and I want to invite you to stay with us as well as we ask Congressman Rutherford to weigh in on the latest Mueller report headlines.

Thank you for starting and ending your day with news for Jacks. You're watching This Week in Jacks and Ville with Kent Justice. One of the biggest political stories of the week erupted when special counsel Robert Mueller took the podium at the Justice Department. He laid out details into his investigation into Russian election meddling. These were Mueller's first public comments on his works since his investigation began in 2017. After nearly two year investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller spoke out about his report, both on the probe into Russian election meddling. Russian intelligence officers who were part of the Russian military launched a conservative attack on our political system. And on the issue of obstruction of justice, Mueller signing Department of Justice policy into the decision to not pursue charges against President Donald Trump. Under long standing department policy, a president president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. But Mueller added this, if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime. Mueller submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, March 22nd, Barr released a letter summarizing his principal conclusions two days later, saying there was not sufficient evidence to establish that President Trump's campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government. April 18th, a redacted version of Mueller's report was released. Mueller closed his statement this week with this warning to lawmakers. They ended the public. There were multiple systematic efforts to interfere in our election. And that allegation deserves the attention of every American. Congressman John Rutherford remains with us. So Congressman, what will Congress do based on what Robert Mueller is saying here about his investigation? Well, clearly, this is a challenge to our elections that Congress takes very seriously. We've already begun working with different departments responsible for protecting that. As you know, though, that's at the state and local level. And we are working with state and local elections officials on ways to harden their targets so that that type of tampering cannot occur. We're also not that it did occur. I don't think they ever show that tampering with the actual vote occurred, although we do believe that there was efforts. But the other issues of trying to influence the American electorate, there's work going on there as well, looking for these IP addresses and things that may be run by Russians opposing as Americans and trying to influence our elections. And so there's a full-scale effort underway to block those kinds of individuals from being up in the influence American voters. Well, Congressman, the president says the Mueller report exonerates him even this last week. Mr. Mueller is saying that's not the case. Democrats are in the House and Democrats lead the House are saying, hey, it may be time for impeachment. There's certainly a push there where do you fall in terms of wanting to investigate that at that level to an impeachment of the president? Well, look, the Mueller investigation, what he said yesterday has absolutely is absolutely different than what he said in the report. And the fact that he came out, he said there was no collusion, there was no Russian conspiracy with Americans. Now, he did indict, as you know, Russians. Right, sir. But there was no evidence found that showed that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with the Trump campaign assisted in that effort to sway the American voter. Now, what he also said was that the Office of Legal Counsel did not, that that ruling that they have that a sitting president can't be charged with a crime, indicted with a crime. He also went on to say with A.G. Bill Barr, that look, there may be a special counsel in the future that will indict or charge a president, a sitting president, but this is not the case. It's clearly not happening right now. But this is not the case to do that. So I think it clearly shows that Bob Mueller, a special counsel, did not feel that he was in a position to charge or even intimate that the president committed a crime. The crime of obstruction, which, by the way, obstruction has to do with trying to influence the outcome of a court decision dealing with a crime. There was no crime. There was no underlying crime. So I don't see how you can have obstruction when there is no crime. And even if, I think what you had was you had a president who was willing to protect his presidency. He knew he hadn't done anything criminally wrong. And that's part of what we've heard from him. I think his president. Yeah, it's part of what we've heard from him say I defend myself because. And I think what we're going to find out as Attorney General Barr continues to investigate the investigators, we're going to find out that I believe there was a coup attempt by those at the highest levels of the FBI and the AG, a bloodless coup attempt. I mean, I don't know what else can you call it when Peter Strux says we're going to make sure he doesn't become president. So we are definitely going to come back and talk about that at the right time. I appreciate the time very much. Glad to have you back in district for a little while. Thank you. Good to see you again.

This our first chance though to debrief with Senator Travis Hudson. So welcome back. Appreciate your time. Senate District 7 includes St. John's, Flagler, Volusia Counties. And Senator Florida's lawmaking statute is you have to have a budget when you get through the session. And clearly that's something that you participated on. So tell me about that because I know there are always tough decisions. And specifically when it comes to education, some of the components there. Yeah, I can't say we passed our constitutional duty, the $91 billion budget, 91.1, about 35 billion in education. And when you look at the K-312, which is where my district really focuses on, you've got about 21, a little over 21 billion into the K-312 education system. The big thing we did this year is we increased that BSA, which is the base student allocation, which is what the districts get to spin in their classroom for their teachers and some of their stuff that's non-discretionary. So that salaries that you see the increase typically has been about 20 to $30 a year increasing. Last year we only get about 47 cents. That was the big knock we got done. This year, $75, so about 2 1,5 times more than we've ever done since I've been elected in terms of an increase, which is a big deal for our district to help retain those teachers that they've been so desperately. Is that the kind of thing that teachers and districts have been asking for when they say we don't have enough for education funding? They want to be able to see that money that base student allocation. Yeah, typically we go, there's two forms of that. There's the FEFP, which is every student, and that has categoricals on it. So that means we tell them you have to spin it on transportation or upgrading equipment or classroom materials. That BSA, that base student allocation that I talked about the $75, that's non-discretionary. They can just spin it however they want to. A lot of that goes into those teacher salaries or being able to recruit and retain teachers. So most of the districts and most of the teachers back home say bring that money in, because that's one important to us. Don't restrict this one the dollars, and we heard them loud and clear. The governor was very big on getting more dollars to the district so they could spin it out they want to. He's very big on local control, and we were able to do that this year. It's a testament to his work. Two things before we run out of time. I want to talk about successes in career and technical education. First though, weigh in for me on, you mentioned the governor. The whole cabinet had a cabinet meeting, how do the country, they went to Israel. What do you see in terms of the benefits there and do you agree with that? That trip that some hundred Florida Floridians took to go over there. Right. It was a very ceremonial trip. The cabinet outside of the governor, other cabinet members learned a lot about financial regulations, about desalination, agriculture, school hardening. The governor signed a bill on anti-Semitism while it was there. I think it was great. The entire cabinet got to go and it was very inclusive in terms of that. Some select legislators went, some select media went. When it was all broadcast, I was watching the whole thing on the Florida channel. There were other sites that were streaming to different reporters tweeting and putting on Facebook. I thought it was a historic moment. It shows that the governor cares about our allies, cares about many things that's important to Florida based on our economy and tourism. I think some of the bigger things he did, remember before he got in, he was against Airbnb and some of the practices they were using. When he went over there, they rescinded some of their policies. We have now lifted the ban. That is a huge deal for our economy and tourism and that's something he was able to accomplish on that trip. Let's go back there to the successes that you feel in the budget about career and technical education. You said you could fill my entire show. I could. It goes into policy and budget but we passed a bill. It was one of the big things that the governor wanted, skilled workforce, skilled labor, career and technical education. We did something that hardly any other state is doing. We passed a new way to graduate in the state of Florida, a new track of graduation and it's vocational in nature and that's what we call the CTE, the career and technical education. You still take your basic math science, English and history instead of taking your PE credits or your electives or those language arts or foreign languages that you would have to take to go to college. We identify that you're not going that route and we get you into this program if that's where you want to go and you can go right into the career workforce by taking some of those career ready things that we already have in place. This kind of blends the idea of trade school. It does. It blends it. It still gives you the way we did it actually. It is amazing. We did it in an 18 credit track. So 24 is your typical to get a graduation. If you fall behind in some of these classes, you can get caught back up, forego your electives and go right into those trade schools. At the end, we tied the pre-predeorship and pre-predeorship programs into it. So if you do want to go to a state college that's already tied into those vocational tracks, you absolutely can. So it gives a lot of flexibility to the students and it's something that we've looked at, the governor and the Senate and the House, as I said, every child is different, not every child is meant for college. And what we're doing is we're shoving them down a track and they're losing their way. They feel left out and we're trying to show them there's plenty opportunities. Make it feel special about, we added into that bill a career signing day. So you know the football and baseball players always get their signing day. If you're going right into the workforce, you have a signing day now too and their school districts are going to establish that. More importantly, we bring back the academic advisor role. If you fall below a 2.0 and academic advisor will sit down with you, show you the different ways you can graduate, the different career paths you can go and get you back on track. So there's a lot of stuff in there. The governor at the end asked for the computer science programs, computer science programs to be funded for some of our teachers that want to do that. That was put in at day 58 and the best thing we got I think is financial literacy. We took it out of that three week program in economics. It's now its own elective which is about a few months from. There's so many people that I've heard say, why aren't we teaching some of these skills? Well, a lot of skills that you've just described come into that. Senator Hudson, I know, like you said, you could talk the whole program about this particular effort, but appreciate the time this morning in Phyllis and. Absolutely. Thank you. All right. So we are working to bring Duval County school leaders into talk with us on our show as well. As you may know, the district is pushing for a half cent sales tax to go on the ballot. We want you to hear the plans from the board chair and the superintendent. Plus, before the month is through, we will have seen the first presidential candidate debates in election 2020, believe it or not. I'll be covering those for you from South Florida. This week in Jacksonville airs each Sunday morning of this time. I'm Kent Justice. Thanks for watching on air and channel four in the CW-17 and online at newsprojects.com.",

        "transcript": " I want to give you a perspective from 41 years of law enforcement, 12 of this year, riding the streets of Jacksonville, Florida. I can tell you one of the things that I learned during that 41 years and a lot of this room can tell you as well is security is always a multi-layered approach. So as we talk about the background checks, who can buy a gun, who cannot, all of those things are important. And all of those are parts of the security that we can create for our country. But know this, and you said it, all of that can break down and someone go into a gun-free zone and just kill it will. The defenseless people. So number one for security from the law enforcement perspective is you have to have, the only thing and it sounds cliche, but it's cliche because it's true. The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. And so you have to have those officers or some armed security at our schools. Now the issue is, and we talk about those are areas where there are no guns. The reason I carry a concealed firearm everywhere I go is because I don't know where those gun-free zones are that I may be walking through with them all or at the donut shop or wherever I might be. So that's why I carry concealed. So that I can protect myself. I can protect my family who might be with me. And I can protect all of those around me who choose not to carry a firearm. But you're not allowed to conceal that a gun-free zone. No, well, so what do you do? You can't carry in those areas. And so you're, you're, I mean I'm a will like everybody else. So that's why the most dangerous places. Exactly. And that's why we need to look at, I think, going back to the concealed carry issue of national reciprocity. I just don't think you're going to get the proof of it. You're not going to get concealed carry proof. Amy and Diane. You're right. A lot of other people, they, people they're never going to consider, but people make consider it. But they're not going to consider it in this bill. All it's going to mean, you know, is that we don't want to know why we're gun-free zones. As far as I'm concerned, and I would do it with the military. In fact, I'm looking to get rid of gun-free zones in the military bases with gun-free zones. There's five incredible soldiers, three of whom were championship shooters that were nowhere near their gun in this white job walked in and killed all of them. And they were defenseless. And if they had their guns, he would have been gun in a second. And every time I walk in the someplace, carrying a concealed eye-in, a gun-free zone, whether it's a restaurant, whether it's a, you know, a grocery store or a military base. Whatever it might be. So, so, and let me close with this because the mental health piece, I think, is going to be critical for law enforcement. We have, we actually take folks who are in danger of themselves or others. We bake or act them in Florida, it's called the bake or act. It's a crisis stabilization process. They're there for three days, 72 hours. They get stabilized. They get out. We have to give them their guns back. I tried not to do that one time and actually got sued and lost the case. Had to give the guns back and we got fined. So, the state of Florida has this bill that was mentioned earlier that the Senate just passed. It has these risk protection orders built in this. And those, and there's some states that already have that, I believe. And I think those are going to be critical for law enforcement to help make the guns out of the hands of these individuals who we know should not be carrying. And then we need to make sure that those individuals get placed into the National Background Check system. And Mr. President, the Vice President.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have to tell you, our anglers back home, their main lament right now is, you know, Noah closed our seasons because too many fish are being, or because there weren't enough fish. Now they're closing our season because there's too many fish being caught and discarded. And so, you know, one of the things that I'd like to go to you, is that there is, in your own report on stock assessment page five, it says, this is all about, and this goes back to Mr. Women's Point. And there is scientific uncertainty. And in fact, the data uncertainty that is highlighted here is the exact reason that we are restricting red snapper. And that is commercial discards and recreational discards. That's the data uncertainty in your biomass determination. And then, of course, population dynamic uncertainty under sources of recruitment and environmental changes. So, my, and so now in light of all that, I want to ask you this question. Does my bill stop the implementation of anything in the council's recommendation to stop Noah's perceived over fishing? Is there anything in my bill that stops you from going forward with what the council already passed? Thank you for that question, Congressman. Noah recognizes the issues associated with the discards. I've only got five minutes. Is there anything in my bill that stops the council from going forward with the recommendations to stop over fishing that you've already implemented? Noah will be taking the recommendations from the council meeting and looking at those to make sure that they're consistent with Magnus and Stevens and then moving forward. The answer is no. There's nothing in my bill that will stop you from moving forward with those council recommendations. Now, let me ask you, now, you've not recommended closing the bottom. Is that, the closures are not the recommendation right now. Is that correct? That's correct. The council has not recommended. Can you tell me why? I think that they took the best scientific advice in it this time, did decide not to proceed with a time area closure as part of the management tools available to them. Okay. So, looking at your biomass calculations and the uncertainty that's built into that, that you recognize, it's in your own report on page five, do you think that Noah's abundance data is reliable? Thank you, Congressman. I'm not familiar with the exact report you are referring to. And so, I can't address that specific question at this time. I'll show it to you. So, let me ask you this. Do you think that Noah's data on recreational discards is reliable? Thank you, Congressman. I think this is an issue that we continue to need more information on. And I think that- I'm going to stop you there because you just said exactly what this bill is all about. Getting you more data. Getting you good data. Reliable data. So, when you make these assumptions about biomass, we can be much closer to the truth. Mr. Chairman, that's what this bill is all about. It simply says, don't close the bottom until this great red snapper count is completed, which we have funded in a very bipartisan way, $5 million over the last four years, to have this third party independent study. All it says is don't close the bottom until we get that information in, and you can then add that into your data. Look, I believe if you have good data, you can make better decisions. And that's all I want to do is help you make better decisions with good data. Not the data that you recognize is not data uncertainty, commercial discards, recreational discards, population dynamic uncertainty. You get a lot of uncertainties built into your models, and it's not an easy issue. That's why this count is so important. And I think some other things that can be done as well, but that's why this bill needs to pass, and I thank you for your time.",

        "transcript": " Hi, sir. Are you able to hear me? Okay, sir. I can hear you. Can you hear me now? Yes, I can, sir. Sorry, my computer does not have a webcam, but first and foremost, I'll make sure you all are all right and safe. Yeah, we are safe. We're in my office. Oh, good. Okay. Good. Wow. I don't even know where to start. Yeah, I won't take up too much of your time, because I know, you know, everything is going on on your busy. But let's first start with what, what did you witness today? Well, we were in the Capitol on the house floor. And, you know, let me, let me first say, this is a very sad day. This lawlessness is just an American. Congress, we were on the floor. We were following a peaceful and well laid out legal process within federal law and the Constitution. And they've now turned it into a national disgrace. And I can only pray that lives and property are protected. The president needs to step up. I understand that he called for peace. He needs to call for people, his supporters to evacuate the Capitol. And I hope that he will do that soon. And, but to get back to your question, when we were, we were on the house floor, as I said, going through the constitutional process. And we got information that the Capitol had been breached. They recessed. Some members left immediately. I left immediately. I was going through the tunnel is Capitol Hill police were running back to the Capitol. I was, you know, one of the first times I'm running away and they're running into it. And so we went back to our offices. And really, I was able to get back to my office with really no problem. In all your years in public service, I've heard some of representatives, you know, on various outlets say, this is kind of like a doomsday scenario that was sent out to you. Have you ever witnessed or what were you feeling like and have you ever witnessed something like this? You know, I have to tell you, this is, no, I've never witnessed anything like this. Our country has never experienced anything like this. And that's why I call on these folks who support our president. I understand that, but there's a legal lawful process that we were following. And it's a peaceful process. And that's what our, you know, our forefathers foresaw that there may be challenges within elections. And that's why this process was set up the way it is for, you know, under US three code section 15, the whole process of today, the fact that we met on the six, the fact that we met at one o'clock, the fact that we met in joint session. All of that is laid out, the fact that we have a process for objecting. All of that's laid out in the law. We were simply following the law. And, you know, and after this lawlessness to take over the day, it's a sad, it's a sad day for America. We had heard that gas masks were, that Capitol Police told representatives to put their gas masks on if they had them because tear gas is being deployed. Did you, you said you got away kind of quickly, but did you encounter any protesters who have to put on your gas mask or any of that? No, I did not. I had left the floor as soon as I recessed. And I did, as we were told, to get back to our offices and hunker there. And that was a text message you guys received or an email alert. How did it kind of come across? They recessed on the floor. Did they send out a message, so telling you guys to hunker down as well? No, no, that was the, I don't believe that came through an email. I think they mentioned that on the floor. Gotcha, gotcha. Where do you see this going now? I mean, you did say you call on the president. He has been tweeting a little bit. The vice president has as well, which more strongly calling on protesters to leave the Capitol. What is your message for the president? Is he to blame for this happening today? Look, I blame the people that are illegally inside the Capitol right now. That is lawlessness. And that's who I blame for this. Peaceful protest is fine. Just like all summer, you know, we're the party of law and order. And I wish they wouldn't respect that. And so, you know, I don't blame the president for this. I blame the people that are committing the lawlessness. And just to ask you questions for you, obviously, there's going to have to be a lot done now. They have said sweeping the floor because there have been a lot of these protesters in there. Where do you see this process going now in the next few hours and days? Well, I certainly hope that once they evacuate the building, as you mentioned, I'm sure they'll have to sweep it. And then I would hope that sometimes this evening, we'd be able to get back to our constitutional duties. And I know that you had mentioned public on Twitter last week and in recent days that you plan to object to electoral college results. Obviously, we'd seen part of that take place this point or this afternoon, but you still plan on doing that? Well, I think we should continue to go through the process. Yes. Is there anything else that could happen? We're doing the process of protesting Arizona at the time. And, you know, there's, look, this process was set up so that state legislatures would be able to maintain their plenary of the process. Plenary authority over elections within their various states. And in some states, that was violated. And that's how we, and that's why we were objecting to those states where the state legislatures were not involved in many of the election changes that were made in some cases just days before the election. And just the last question for you. How will you remember this day in personally and for America? As I said earlier, it's a very sad day. It really is, I think, a day of national disgrace. And I hope and pray that, you know, everyone will be okay. We can get through this process. I did hear of a shooting inside the Capitol. I haven't confirmed that, but it's disgraceful. Yeah, we have heard several outlets reporting that some law enforcement did shoot, I believe, a woman inside the Capitol. So I mean, I just have no words. I can't imagine being there. I can't either. You know, and I know of the thousands of protesters that are out there, you know, I just call on them to peacefully protest, evacuate the Capitol. And let us get back to lawfully going through this process that the Constitution set out for us. Anything else that you would like to add, sir? I think that was it, Kayleigh. All right. And I know you've got to add it pretty quickly. So I'm not sure if you had any, your staffers, any pictures of anything that's going on there. Yeah, I figured it out. Yeah, no, I understand. I just had to ask. All right, sir. Well, I believe that your staffers on my information, if you guys have any other updates, I'll let them know as well. And I hope you guys stay safe and we're thinking of all of y'all at the Capitol, because this is just crazy. I think very much and pray for America. Yes, sir. Have a good night. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " This whole business of governing is about partnerships of cooperation and shared visions and I'll tell you there's nobody who is better to work with than Mayor Greg Fisher. He is amazing. So you know as unpleasant as politics can be which it turns out is pretty unpleasant. I'll tell you what this part never gets old. And I don't mean just me or this race. We've gotten to kick off some really important nights together and some historic nights together. Ten years ago we were able to switch control of the House of Representatives and thereby elect the first woman speaker of the House in Nancy Pelosi. So that was ten years ago. Eight years ago we did it again and we elected the first African-American president of the United States. And I don't really want to go through the litany of accomplishments of this administration but you know people have short memories but when you think back to where we were in 2008 and the country was on the verge of financial collapse and there were so many things going wrong and Barack Obama came in and led us and has now orchestrated one of the most incredible recoveries that any nation could have achieved. And now we're on the verge of eight years later, tonight breaking that incredible glass ceiling and electing the first woman president of the United States. Pretty amazing, I say it everybody. So I got to serve with the first woman speaker of the House, the first African-American president of the United States and now I'm going to get to serve with the first woman president of the United States. And Kentucky we all know what that is. That is the triple crowd. But you know I know that I wouldn't be standing here tonight without you. I also know that you really don't do it for us personally and nor should you. Like me you're driven by passion for equal opportunity, responsibility, and community. Ideals that have made this country great for 240 years and continue today. Not because we achieved them but because we will never stop their pursuit. We're not a country that asks are we there yet? We're a country that asks what we need to do to move forward together. You've never lost sight of that. In the midst of the most vile, destructive campaign of my lifetime, which is now pretty long, when it would have been easy to turn away you stage focus. You did the work that needs to be done to keep the wheels of progress in motion and ensure that this nation of immigrants continues to be the land of opportunity to be the land of opportunity. For all Americans, no matter what we look like, how we pray or whom we love. You know the thing about glass ceilings, you can see what's waiting on the other side. And it's not the welcoming committee. The vitriol we've seen over the last year, that's not going to go away tomorrow. And it won't be just idling until the next election. We may be sending the most prepared, effective leader in our lifetimes into the Oval Office. But even in an improved Congress, there are going to be a lot of people who so priority is ensuring that she fails. That may sound pessimistic, but believe it or not, I'm actually more optimistic about this country's future than I've been in a long time. And it's because of something else we've seen in this election. You have a lot more power than you think. You've seen how politicians are dancing this year. The Trump two-step, I support him, but I won't endorse him and I don't know who I'm voting for. I endorse him, but I won't defend him and I'm voting with a number three pencils, so it might just be erased. And then of course there's Mitch McConnell. They may not be the silent majority, but they've got a silent majority leader. These people have taken almost as many positions on the President's erase as they have to repeal Obamacare. Why does anybody believe that chains their minds? No, you did. You changed their minds. You made it impossible for partisans to play only to their base. You make it untenable for politicians to maintain abhorrent positions. You shape our leaders, not just by replacing them, but by making them sure we don't forget that you can. Politicians are looking forward to this election being over because they think you'll stop paying attention. They want you to think Congress is so broken that nothing possibly could happen. To give up on them now and look away later, blame a faulty institution instead of the individuals at fault. Don't buy it. That first Nancy Pelosi Congress raised the minimum wage, lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, and I think the largest veterans healthcare increase ever cut federal student loan interest in half and more. And we did it all working with a Republican President. Next year, I challenge you to reject the temptation to look away, to continue wielding the power we've seen these last few months. Don't let the culprits off the hook by blaming some inevitable congressional dysfunction. Call them out by name. Make them dance for you again. Tell them we expect more and we demand more when they try to stop the President from filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Don't let them get away with that. Tell them we expect more. We demand more. When they signal that women, the gay community, immigrants, people of color or the disabled are somehow less than, tell them we expect more. We demand more. When the only healthcare solution they can offer is taking coverage away from 20 million Americans. Tell them we expect more. We demand more. And we demand more of Governor Bevan when he plans to take healthcare away from 450,000. When they talk about building walls instead of bridges, show more interest in shutting down the government than opening up new opportunities when they prioritize billionaire investors over investments in our nation's future. And gun manufacturers over gun victims, tell them we expect more. We demand more. The work that lies ahead, no one person can do alone, not even Hillary Clinton. But if we stand together and demand more, there is nothing we cannot achieve. That's why I'm optimistic and it's why I want this election is behind us. I can confidently say once again that our best days lie ahead. I've always been a witness. I've always been able to count on this community to stand up for what is right and fight the fights that need fighting. I'm honored and grateful that you've asked me to be your representative in Washington once again and I'm energized to be your ally in those battles. 350 million unique and individual and diverse individuals share this country and nobody's going to take it back or anywhere else. We're going to move it forward together. Thank you all very much.",

        "transcript": " Mr. Chairman. General, let me paint a little picture of the FBI that I knew for many years. And I think most would agree. They are the premier law enforcement agency, not just in the United States, but I think most likely in the world. Would you agree with that? I think they're viewed. And I'll say one of, because we oversee other law enforcement agencies at the Justice Department. Oh, OK. Well, I'll let you off the hook on that one. But also that Mr. Struck, who's risen to a very high level within that organization, has to be a premier agent within the premier agency, the FBI. That's certainly what we were told. I agree with that. And so in fact, I don't know that the FBI, at least in the 40 years that I've been in law enforcement, ever conducted an investigation that brought the integrity of the agency and the investigative process under such scrutiny and questioning of the integrity of the agency. Would you agree with that? It certainly has brought incredible scrutiny and undercut the credibility of the organization in a way that has unfair to all these thousands of agents out there. Exactly. And I've never seen anything like it. And in fact, even Agent Struck, I don't know if anything in his past that ever questioned his integrity and his service to the FBI or his country. I'm not aware of anything. So when I look at your report, and then you outline several investigative and prosecutorial missteps in this particular case, and I'll read just a few of them for you. This is from the Roman Roman War in the summary. The preference for consent over compulsory process to obtain evidence, decision to obtain, not to obtain, or to seek to review certain evidence such as the personal devices used by Secretary Clinton's senior age, the use of voluntary witnesses over these interviews, quote, decisions to enter into letter use or queen for a day immunity agreements with three witnesses, some of which I think might have been potential targets as well, had the potential anyway. The use of consent agreements and active production immunity to obtain the laptops used by Clinton's attorneys, Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, to call her personal and work-related emails, the handling of the Clinton interview on July 2, the tarmac meeting, the mid-year exam delay and looking into the Anthony Wiener laptop situation, director Comey's draft date of exoneration letter in May. So my question is, when you look at these things in the totality, you look at them individually, you may not see much. But you know in a civil rights prosecution, you look at patterns or practices that will overcome any written policy that they may be presenting. And all I'm plain to fast to do is show a pattern or practice. To overcome a defense by an organization that, you know, we have this policy against, you know. So when you say that you found political bias, but it had no effect on the investigation, it seems in a gate this pattern or practice that clearly existed in this investigation. I just want to say we didn't find that it didn't have any impact on the investigation. We couldn't possibly have looked at all these decisions, as you said, that covered all this period of time. What we found was focused on the individual investigations. And I think what's important for people to understand is, our responsibility as an inspector general is an inspector general and looking at these issues is not to say this was thorough or not thorough or the best choice or not the best choice or could have been done more aggressively or not, but we're looking at was there misconduct? Let me ask one more question very quickly. Have you ever seen a public relations campaign mounted surrounding an investigation like we saw here, where there's a SAT conference so that the agency can pass down information on this case so that they can squat down, quote, squat down stories about it and they even briefed retirees. Have you ever seen that before? It's a great question, Congressman. Actually, the first in yesterday's hearing in today who's asked about that portion of the report and it doesn't directly affect this investigation, but for the reasons you indicated, I think we were concerned in particularly in the context of when it was occurring, which was in October during the campaign. And in our view, you look at that and you say, you know what, when there's a campaign going on and either side commenting on this, the best place for the just department B is on the sidelines. The political debate will be the political debate it might be fair, it might be unfair, but when you start doing that and sending out talking points across the country, you might actually be encouraging people, maybe unintentionally, we didn't make an intent find here, but maybe unintentionally encouraging people to, as you suggest, to get the word out. Well, it may cause other people to want to speak who maybe don't agree with the talking points. And so that was one of the areas that we had concern about and I appreciate you raising that Congressman because I do. I just can't figure out how Peter Struck is still at the FBI. Chairman Eils back to,",

        "transcript": " Joining us now is Corey Mills. He's a decorated US combat veteran in the co-founder of Paisam Solutions. Corey, when we look at exactly what the president was talking about yesterday, there were some things, one regarding flag burning, one regarding statues. I want to just start with really briefly the idea of flag burning. The Supreme Court has said that that is a form of free speech. You of course have served yourself. A lot of people say that it's a slap in the face essentially to a lot of people who have fought for those very freedoms to burn the flag. So what is your response to the whole idea of flag burning? Is it something that you think maybe we should revisit? Yes, absolutely. I mean, look, the truth is is that I've seen so many of my brothers who had to come home with a flag draped coffin. That flag represents what we are as a nation. That flag represents our liberties. It represents the blood that's been spilled in order to maintain and keep our freedoms. You know, just other day I I heard something which was absolutely absurd. You had Brett Far trying to compare Pat Tillman, a known and decorated war hero who sacrificed two careers, not only his life in the military, but also his life to make millions with Colin Kaepernick, who shows no respect whatsoever for the flag and takes a knee. You know, the idea that Brett Far, the NFL and NASCAR and all the rest continue to pander is really insulting not only to veterans like myself, but all those who are serving. And it is kind of an interesting debate too because of course it would have to go to the Supreme Court and the president has had two Supreme Court nominees throughout his tenure so far. And if the possibility to were to open up where he could appoint someone else, this is an issue that could actually be revisited by the court. And in fact, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch has said that they would be willing to revisit some old standing. So it might be something to keep an eye on as well. But I do want to pivot now also to the idea of statues. That's something that we've seen taking place across the country. Different statues being torn down, differing on the degree of whether or not it's warranted or not, some being Confederate soldiers, some being just US presidents. So when it comes to that issue as well, President Trump said that he would consider almost using military force or even the National Guard to protect some of these monuments. Is that something that's plausible? Yes, absolutely. I mean, look, the reality is these are national monuments. These are things which belong to the public and are there to honor our government, our history. You know, erasing history, you know, with regards to statues and vandalizing doesn't necessarily remove the past. If anything, it prevents people from being able to learn forward. You know, to be honest with you, Alex, this really reminds me of a very classic three-phase model that the communists and socialists used to use where in phase one, they would distribute propaganda by attacking key elements that represent that government. So a flag, a statue, etc. The second phase of launching more escalated attacks where they're seizing cities and trying to overthrow government and utilizing both a political and military wing of this. I mean, it's very, very common, you know, communist socialists type of stance that Antifa and everyone is trying to utilize. And I think the president needs to stand firm and he is law and order. And that's what we need. We need law and order in this country to prevent the hundreds of murders, the dozens that have just happened in the last week or so in Chicago and Baltimore and Seattle and isn't an ironic that every one of those are Democrat-led cities. So yes, the president should absolutely do what is necessary to control the lawlessness and to protect our national monuments. And you bring up law and order. And I think that's an interesting point too because that is something that the president has said that he wants to make sure is instilled throughout the country. And as we now have the luxury of hindsight, we look back and we see some of the unrest that did take place in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, New York. It has died down for the most part, although just last night. We saw in Washington, D.C., that it's not entirely gone just yet. But with the luxury of hindsight, looking back, do you think the president should have used the National Guard or the military to qualms some of those unrest, those more violent riots and looting that were taking place across the country? Well, he did in most cases. He actually deployed the National Guard and they went in and they actually quelled things very quickly. You know, the reality is always that these cities, you know, law and order is first designated as a state right. So the cities, the counties, the mayors, the government representatives, they have a right to try and go ahead and govern that state and ensure they can take control over it. The only reason that the federal government's even involved is because the failure by people who want to call protests or looting and vandalism a block party and then watching people being raped and murdered in that area. So yeah, absolutely. I think the president should have stepped in. He did step in. He's made the right decisions. He's protecting our monuments and he will restore law and order in this country. And before I let you go to, I want to get your opinion on the whole idea of defunding police. I know it varies depending on what degree you really agree with that notion. It's all the way from abolishment to minor tweaks to the current system as well. But we just talked about the unrest that's taking place not only in regard to statues, not only in regard to the prior rioting and looting. What would it mean to defund the police? Look, defunding the police. I wrote an article that was published in Fox News recently and that outfit was exactly on this topic. The reality is that whenever you defund the police, this is not going to impact or hurt the affluent neighborhoods will privatize law enforcement and go ahead and utilize their own private security that's there with a G&K license whose armed and ready to protect themselves. The reality is is that they want this to basically impact those lower income areas because the real threat right now is black on black violence. That's what we're seeing in a lot of these suburban cities. And that's really the issue right now. And Antifa and others are actually exposing that and trying to get banjo this lawlessness. The idea of defunding police is absolutely idioxy. I don't even see how this could even be a point which is talked about other than the idea of what the Democrats have been doing which is pandering to the left and trying to show themselves as they're willing to look out for the black lives move. And the reality is they're not taking a knee in a raise of awareness. They're taking a knee in an order to raise funding. And when we look around the country too, that has been tried to sub-degree in the past, whether it be in New York City, Chicago, Baltimore, and it hasn't been successful. We do have case studies to go off of. And when you pull back resources from those communities, it doesn't help the people in those communities. So I think you're right on to say that. Corey Mills, I appreciate you coming on tonight.",

        "transcript": " We're going to be here today for the first time in the country. Joining us right now is Florida Congressman elect Cory Mills. Consman elect. Congratulations to you. Thanks very much for being here. Tell us about your race and what we're seeing in Florida today. Well, thank you so much. I appreciate it. It's great to be standing here as a Congressman elect for Florida 7th District. I think what you saw in Florida, however, is that a lot of people are already voting with their feet escaping blue states like New York coming to Florida and not wanting to see a lot of what they just left. I think that's why we're going to see the first time in the country. We realized that Florida fought against the political science and opted for medical science when it came to COVID that we maintained our schools open. It was a while when number three in the country and lower and then middle education. Lowest taxes and second lowest taxes in the country. No state tax. Freedom really exists here in Florida, but I'll tell you, Governor Ron DeSanck is an amazing job, not just campaigning for himself, but also campaigning for all Florida candidates on numerous occasions. He had me at his rallies to support the state. He recognized me throughout the entire race here in central counties, while for in Belusia. I think that he really just fought for Florida candidates and doing sure that Florida goes more red. Yeah, and we saw that. What disinterested campaigning big. You, of course, it worked for you. You had a big win against your Democrat opponent to Karen Green, flipping Florida 7th district red for the first time. In how many years, what do you do now with it? Where are your priorities? What do you do now? What do you do now? What do you do now? What do you do now? What do you do now? What do you do now? What do you do now? What do you do now? What do you do now? I was. I didn't recognize how this situation actually was, and I didn't recognize that you were just simply grateful for the priorities once you got working. The priorities are deliver on the campaign promises that we made. You know, for too long, you have got Republicans who are stopping a political rhetoric alone. We need to be a person of action now. That's one of the things that CD-7 understood. You know, I am a United States Army combat veteran. I did go to Afghanistan during the Afghan Bosh withdrawal to save American during hurricane. During Hurricane Ian I was will recognize me for as a person of action, not a person of cheap talk. Uh, Congressman, elect, uh, were you surprised by what happened last night? I mean, obviously, Florida, we did see it go ruby red, but when it came to these other states, like Pennsylvania, uh, it seems that, uh, Republicans fell short. Do you believe that it's because, they didn't hold Biden accountable or was it that we were just outspent and out-organized? Well, life former speaker, New Gingrich said, I think a lot of analysis is going to need to take place here because there was a couple of races that truly shocked me. Uh, Myra Flores, Texas 34, Casey Garcia, Texas as well, Catalina Lof and, uh, Illinois, uh, the federalman Oswreys and Pennsylvania. There's a lot of things that we need to be looking at. I think that it's time now for leadership and for the entire Republican Party to understand exactly what America's real focus is. And I think that we need to continue to try and get better at messaging and getting our message out there for the rest of the populace. You know, this isn't about just talking about the spear tactics of this or that. It's about really saying, here's the issues and here's the solutions, not just bringing up what the problem is are because every American is facing these problems, seeing these problems, feeling these problems, whether it's the economic impacts or whether it's, you know, other things. So we really need to do a better job at messaging and put them together solutions. Well, we've been talking about that for a long time. Good needs to do a better job messaging. Congressman Electro, you're going to be watching you. We so appreciate you trying this morning and of course your service to this great country. Thank you so much. Koi Mills. Enjoying this. Thank you so much, Maria. I will see you soon.",

        "transcript": " Let's bring in Florida Congressman and former US Army sniper Corey Mills. What kind of shot was this Corey from 130 yards? Look at the end of the day. This is a shot that your basic training boot camp soldier is requested to make within their nine week period. This is one of the easiest shots and they train all the way out till 300 or 500. And when I was doing the Congress sniper, it wasn't with the United States Army. It was actually when I was with the State Department and was doing this exact thing, which is trying to look at going out with an advanced team, establishing what the perimeter is. And then as a sniper, when you would set up, you'd put together your range sketch or your range fan cards. And that would tell you where you're 100, you're 200, you're 300, and you'd identify the areas of threat that you would be able to mitigate. And if there's multiple targets, you understand that your elevation and windage knob wouldn't have to be messed with, especially at 160 yards. You could literally just look quickly glance and know from the reference point, whether it be a building, whether it be a lone tree, whether it be a parking lot, maybe it's a road. Bottom line is that this is massive negligence to the point of me speculating on what was intentional and what wasn't. Wow. When you're doing a site survey and you're seeing this rooftop, not that far away. Why did it look like the counter sniper team was a little surprised? You know, I can only speculate and we'll have to wait until the investigation comes out that they thought local law enforcement was potentially climbing up onto the roof when they saw a dark object on a light roof. But here's the issue. Wait a minute. You're saying maybe they misconstrued crooks for a friendly for local law enforcement. It's very possible. I don't want to speculate into the investigation is over. But the bottom line is that if you saw someone climbing going to a roof that you hadn't authorized any clearance on, it's got a clear line of sight. It's exactly adjacent to the shooting where the president was sitting and you're talking about a pop shot and you've got people yelling and there should have been comms. The minute that that local law enforcement who apparently had a rifle pointed on, there should have been an emergency frequent comms channel that they could have said we have a shooter on the roof, shooter on the roof, secret service should have rushed the stage and immediately took the president and took him off and then responded the counter sniper. The shot should not have gone off. That is the failure in itself. You're supposed to be able to try and you know, the best security is when you go in and you're actually able to prevent an incident, not react to an incident. Even if you would have left a law enforcement officer's patrol car in that parking lot with the lights on, that could have been a deterrent. But when you have nothing that is actually showing force protection, you're encouraging this. Look, I'm not sure about who the individuals are on the individual detail, secret service, but I can tell you under this Biden administration, the one thing I've seen is massive DEI hires. And I can tell you when you primary, when you primarily go after DEI, you end up with DIE. So when you have these counters, snipers waiting until eight rounds are fired, what accounts for that? To be honest with you, after the first shot, you get a return fire immediately. The minute that a shot rang out, they should have already been on scope. Your spotter should have already have called the distance. If you hadn't looked at your range cart and you should have immediately engaged, there should have been no reason to have waited a single second. Now I talked to Eric Trump after the incident. Eric and I are both gun enthusiasts. We both shoot long distance. That right there is a pop shot, but he did say I've gone out with the CS teams and they are one of the best. I've he knows the actual service detail, the two of them, they are loyal individuals who actually do care about the president. I can say that was that was relate to me, but the bottom line is this is a massive security breach. This is a huge failure at negligence is at best, but we have to figure out why something within 200 yards. Think about this, Jesse, 200 yards. That means that an average rifle that holds one minute of angle would hold a two inch grouping if you just shot it straight off the deck, meaning on the on a platform. So now you're talking about 160, which is 1.6 inches is what its grouping capabilities are. The average head is what six by eight shoulder to shoulders 20 inches head to waste is 40 inches and president Trump's a very large man. This is a shot that within five minutes, I could teach you to make nine out of 10 times. So this is divine intervention. This is the God having his protective hand and wearing a fusion six, the armor of God over the president because this is right here, a millisecond or a millimeter in change. And this is an attempted assassination. This is an assassination of a president. The devil was in Butler, Pennsylvania, but so was God. Well, and I can say one more thing if I may, which is that let us also remember that King Henry, this second went in and said, can no one rid me of this turbulent priest and his, King his nights went out and killed the archbishop of Canavera because they thought that was a direct order. What do you say when president Biden says we should time to put a target on Trump? That in my opinion is the insightful rhetoric. That's the stuff that they would have went after for the J6 stuff. So why don't we have our own J 13 investigation? There needs to be a full investigation on this. Absolutely. And it needs to not be crooked like some of these other former investigations were. That's right. Politicians. Mills are the best. Thank you. Thank you. Click here to subscribe to the Fox News YouTube page to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis.

        "transcript": " In 10 days we have the opportunity to join the slum. It is time to bring an outsider from Florida to DC. It is time to bring common sense from Florida to DC, a business name. Someone that is going to make America safer, affordable, and is going to make America great again. Please help me welcome our next congressman, Corey News. I think you guys can hear me without the mic, right? Yeah, we don't hire. Use the military voice. Alright, so let me give you a quick 30,000 foot view on me. Then I'm going to go ahead and just talk about a couple of things and then turn it over. So I'm a six-generation flaredie and I was born and raised in Central Florida. A little tiny town called Winner Haven. Then I grew up in Auburn Bay. I'm not going to graduate from high school. I ended up going off to the military serving the United States Army. I served in the 82nd Airborne Division, served with J. Sox, T.J. K.I. 24, Iraq, which is the Joyce Bishop Operations Command. And then decided that after my military service, I wanted to come back and kind of get back to my community. I came back, I started college at UNF, right up the street at Q2J, which is right there in Jacksonville. I lived there for a few years and found another need for the government to call me back. Went back to service for another five years, held overseas, and wars that we all can admit has done nothing for us as a nation. Wars at over two and a half decades has spent trillion dollars. Wars at over the last two and a half decades cost thousands of more Americans. You know, our whole concept for trying to go after those who come after us, I'm not opposed to. The idea of ensuring that the whole land is safe. I'm not opposed to. The idea of interventionism and nation building is where I have my biggest issues. If we were to step to a counterterrorism operation that actually went after those who are responsible in this stock, I could have actually gotten behind that, but the reality is it became political football. When I saw that this political football was going on, I was seeing where the decrons and the needle lips were the ones who were actually enriching themselves off these wars. Wars are a lot of the guys that I served with that didn't come home to. That's where I started having an issue. When I came back, I wanted to start looking at job creation. I believe very strongly that the private sector creates jobs, not the federal government. Federal government, we see it as business owners, they stifle us, they overregulate us, they overtac us. They try and force us to shut down with unconstitutional mandates. This is not job creation. As someone who has signed the front-up checks, not just the back of checks, I can tell you that we need to empower our private sector to remove federal government from our lives. I'm a huge advocate of limiting federal government over each. I'm a huge advocate of state and individual rights. I don't think that a federal government needs to tell us how to raise our children. I don't think that the federal government needs to tell us how to do our business in Florida. I don't think that the federal government has a right to step into our homes to tell us how to live our lives. You see, I believe in something which is the enabling of both rights. This in my opinion, Mr. Patis, our constitution, lives our God-given rights, things like the right to protection that we take as the second amendment. Thinking about the rights of us being able to have the right to parents to tell the federal government what our children will not be taught. We don't need sexualization in our schools. What we need is we need civics, we need history, we need mathematics, we need English, we need the skills to actually advance our children. Not federal government trying to indoctrinate them with CRT and things like the 1619 project. You see, in my personal opinion, the federal government has tried, and again, we just talked to a few minutes ago, after the 17th amendment, you saw this federal growth that occurred because our U.S. senders used to be controlled by our state legislator. They're actually elected by us. What you saw in 1913 was two things that were bad. One, 16th amendment, federal income tax. I'm a consumer taxpayer tax guy. I don't think anything that we earn or anything we invest should be taxed. You really want to worry about fair tax? Tax, they're what are the same. Now, the other thing is that I don't think that our Department of Education should be setting the standards for each of our individual states. I also don't have that idea that taxation on us allows the Department of Education, for example, to control who gets the large government and federal contracts for our poofs. They don't understand. I grew up like, for example, as a young kid, with allergies. And I was adopted by my grandparents and came from a bit of a broken home. My mom and dad were both drug addicts and had substance abuse issues and were in and out of prison my entire life. So I was kind of homeless and bounced to house to house, tap surfing with my friends and tell us about nine years old whenever my grandparents finally found out and adopted me. But I remember that my grandparents were really big on the ideas of having orange blossom honey at a certain time, which made sure I had this, this means to stop. What I would like to see is the federal government does not control where our poofs come from. That money which has passed from there stays within the states is allocated to the individual counties allocated individual schools, let the schools do the RFP RFQ. So we actually support businesses in our local areas, support local growers in our areas. See, I'm an agriculture guy. I believe in the idea that food security is directly related to national security, which is why I don't care if you call me a xenophobic. I don't care if you look at my skin and say I have some kind of specialized privilege. I believe that we should have zero foreign ownership and support for our land in America. Eight percent, eight percent, the Florida GDP, 1.8 billion is based on agriculture. But here's the worst part. We could far exceed that. Florida provides 80 percent of sugar to the rest of the country. But yet it's constantly being vilified by federal agencies like EPA that in my opinion needs to be abolished. We also need to take a further step not just to, as I talked about the 16th Amendment, but talk about the idea of what is really a key to state police force. That's what that 87,000 IRS agents are. That's why they need $600,000 in small caliber ammunition. That's why they have roles, responsibilities like issuing deadly force, like being able to detain, being able to do search and seizure. That doesn't sound like auditors looking to try to come out to your tax and your $1040 EZ. That sounds like someone who understands that you will comply much easier at the end of a barrel than you will end of an evening. That's why I will not fund. The one thing federal Congress has is the purse strings. And I will not fund the 87,000 deep state IRS agents. I won't do it. I also believe in giving Americans their freedom back. And I think that the only way we can do that is by repealing the Patriot Act. I think the Patriot Act is put in place to actually spy on us. That's exactly what we've seen. Think this for one moment. As someone who worked in the Trump administration who has actually endorsed our President Trump, we just watched where the federal government violated his fourth amendment rights as a former President of the United States. In my opinion, the actual President of the United States. I support 50 state audit because we know where the fraud came in. And here's my old thing. If you don't believe that there is any fraud whatsoever, you don't need to be in this room. I'll be honest with you. Because it's not about how large or how small point is is that if we're trying to continually make sure that we are a more perfect union, that we are the constitutional republic that we try to represent, then we should always be open to the ideas of a 50 state audit ensuring that we limit any and all fraud that happens in our elections. So my biggest thing is this. I believe in ensuring that our federal government is limited in its overreaching to our lives. I believe in U.S. term limits and hope that we see a 34 state convention of states that allow a U.S. term limit to occur for state and house. I believe in ensuring that we do not take our down ballot voting for granted any longer. We really need to understand that these mayoral, these city council, these school boards, that we have been taking for granted in trying to prop up these federal graces to be sometimes just celebrity congressional caucus, is not what's important in our day to day lives. If anyone is a constitutionalist, you understand the first three articles and why they are so aptly architect. The first article which covers legislation is about three times the length of everything else. The second, which is the executive, is obviously about half that length in the third, which is judiciary, is about a third of the actual half that the executive branch has. The reason why is because they understood that they only give the most powers and big roles and responsibilities to those that the American people have the most outreach and most touch with. That was intentional. But over time we have continued to dwindle down and dilute the actual state legislators roles, roles like our great representative here. So I encourage everyone, and as I've even talked with Tara and I've talked with Abiyah, I think as Republicans we need to come together and understand that when we go out, we can't have this idea where at the federal level I've got 30 and 40 walkers out there knocking doors and we're getting the votes out, we're doing all this. Meanwhile, we're ignoring what's happening at the state and local levels. We need to actually be working more together, where my 30, 40 walkers is walking for you. Your five or six volunteers are working for us. Your two or three is actually coming together. That's how we build better community. That's how we build a stronger state. We must understand that it's really getting back to the basics of constitutionalism. It's about making sure that we stop things like ESG and this blokeism in our corporations. Stopping CRT in our military, which has now led to a 15,000 person reduction in shortage. Stopping CRT in indoctrination, sexualization of our children in our schools. I believe very simply, less for zero, CRT in ESG and a lot more GOD. Come on. God is one of the main things that they have continued to attack. We know that's one of the fundamental truths that we are as our Constitution is based on today of Christian beliefs. Our built on those in the middle of the rest I talked about. The left has continued to try and win a list down, little by little, first by trying to act as if we have an agnostic or godless constitution. But how did all of our founding fathers sign their names and their actual documents in the year of our Lord? Doesn't sound too godless or agnostic to me. The other thing that we understand is that whenever the left or socialist and Marxists are allowed to remove faith, remove God from our schools, from our houses, from our communities, that their next thing is to go ahead and continue to divide us. And they've gone forth and they've continued to do this, utilizing our ignorance in our silence. We're the majority of far too long moving the silent majority. I don't believe in the corrupt practices are going on. I believe in banning the ideas that any elected official in the federal government should be able to buy, sell and trade stocks, their spouse or anyone who works on the role of you. It should be about public service, not personal enrichment. Every one of our founding fathers or successful businessmen, they left their tobacco crops, their agriculture, their distilleries for those who understand the history of George Washington and his libraries. And they would go off to Washington, let me tell you, they were eager to get back to their successful businesses. Well, over time, we've flipped that. And we've made politics now a very, very financially beneficial business, where people are going in and making all their riches there and then basically not wanting to come back and turn it home. We shouldn't be creating this as a career. No one understands public service like those of us who have actually fought uniform. Let me tell you something. When we take that oath, just because we remove our uniform doesn't mean that oath expires. We believe in the ideas of fighting for our constitution against all of these before domestic. But the reality is that the enemy within is right here at home, domestic. We don't need to fund, and again, I've said this, and I'll continue to say, I'm not an interventionist, but I'm not an isolationist. I'm a protectionist. Protecting American rights and liberties, protecting our borders and our sovereignty, protecting our way of life, protecting American exceptionalism. These are things that we should all be able to subscribe to. These are left to right issues. These are democratic or public and issues. These are America versus anti-America issues. In my business, we actually support over 200 law enforcement departments, SWOT, HRT, SRTs. I can tell you right now that one thing that we stand for and we believe in this idea of defending our law enforcement, not defunding our law enforcement. It's all easy to this. I've got a couple of things that I've been talking about as far as bills that we've drafted. I don't believe in new this OJT. We step in and we just play the freshman card and follow leadership. Leadership doesn't elect me in. The people elect me. The party doesn't elect me in that. The people elect me in. That's also the same reason that in order to not be corrupt or taken in any way, I'm volunteering 100% of my salary to be donated back into the community to a woman's child or better children. I believe in fighting for the people. I believe that's a conviction that I have since birth. I believe that I've been spared continuously in multiple situations to be here right now. Seeing what's happening in Ukraine, I've been a geopolitical analyst. I know where and what is going on when it comes to the Russian China and Iran's geopolitical alignment. I know that kinetic warfare doesn't make us safer abroad, but economic resource dominance does. I believe in the idea is that we cannot stay as a superpower. We don't get in control of our gross domestic production, our security of our nation. We have to take that $80 plus billion that we're fraudulently and corruptly placing in countries like Ukraine and invest those here at home. We need to build two refineries so that we have the ability. We need to make sure we get the keystone as a pipeline in play. We need to make sure that we open more federal lands, exploration, more drill permits, more concessions, and understand that the currency of the world is energy. We have the ability tomorrow to make lives cost affordable. We should be a society that lived on a single income family. Now we can barely survive on two income families. We know that 40-year inflation is not just by mistake, but it's a plan to the modern monetary theory, the idea by the left and socialist that I can create enough debt because I create my own currency to make more currency to then drive up more inflation. Because what am I trying to achieve? Demand destruction. They know that what's happening abroad with the China-Russia-Iran-1 Road-1 Belt Initiative is to try and cut off all of our supply chains for Western hemisphere. Because Russia, China, and Iran will control Africa, Oceania, the Eurasian expansion, which gives them the horn of Africa, Black Sea, Red Sea, Mediterranean, where all of our actual supplies come in and out. And meanwhile, to advance this, we have the left who is trying to attack fossil fuels and American energy. Going towards renewables, not reliables, renewables, where China controls 15 to 16 very mineral mines. We don't harvest cobalt, nickel, lithium here at home. In fact, we just gave $1.3 trillion in lithium to the Chinese when we handed over Afghanistan. So the reality is this, you want lower costs to cool and heat your house, natural gas, right here in America. You want to put trucks on the road, transport supplies, get us back and forth to work cheap, make sure our tractors run, oil and gas. No, right in the road. You're a baby thrill. So I don't support the ideas of us continuing to fund and support adversarial nations like China and Russia. We're out to destroy us. We're out to eliminate the U.S. dollar of being a global currency. We're out to try and drag us into the quagmire of another endless war that won't result in us being any freer or more powerful. But we'll actually end up revolving us to have more Americans, more sons, more husbands, more fathers lost. And start resulting in billions and billions of dollars being wasted. Our money is taxpayers. To seeing our economy start to dwindle because their ultimate goal is they won't be happy until they have removed God from our lives. They've destroyed our constitution. They've created the WHO and WES as the new world singular government order, which is what they want. And they want to empower everyone else while impacting us militarily, diplomatically, and economically and politically. We need people in Washington who actually have the moral courage to call out things. I wish there was a machine that the Grace Medical Invention of the World would be a machine that could actually inject a spine and have people repulpate his own actions. I mean, they say as inverters that we're not supposed to be able to walk upright and somehow politicians do it every day. So I took that from Ted Cruz. He just said that yesterday was hilarious. But the reality is that I wasn't elected in. I didn't have any pack and lobbies in my corner. I funded my own campaign. I didn't drift off the American people. I'm donating my salary back. I pledge my wife, myself, and others won't buy and sell and trade stocks. I guess what I also won't be silenced, whether it's by the left or right, by leadership. Is they owe nothing to me? I owe nothing to them. I owe everything to you. Love your courage.",

        "transcript": " It's recognized for four minutes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The 2001 and 2002 authorization for use of military force licensed the executive branch conduct broad military operations. And Congress has disregarded its constitutional oversight powers as a result. Repealing these outdated AUMS, Resource Congress's constitutional checks on the executive fiat. The United States military forces are present in the Middle East pursuant to an authorization for use of military force that was enacted more than 20 years ago. At that time, Congress did not conceive that these authorizations would sanction an endless military commitment. The United States is not the world's policeman. And it is incredibly unwise to promote this level of involvement in international disputes. However, Democrat and Republican presidents alike have abused the powers of war granted under the 01 and 02 AUMS, and Congress must act to rein back the executive branches' war authorities. Further, continue to dump trillions of dollars into these endless wars as irresponsible, runs contrary to American economic and security interests, and unnecessarily places American lives in jeopardy. It is clear that the basis for the AUMS currently in force have long expired, and Congress must fulfill its constitutional responsibilities and ensure that we are conducting proper oversight of the executive branch and the military operations. Now, I hear my colleagues on the left talking about leaving the Kurds and withdrawals. But yet, I note that these are the exact same individuals that their party argues that it was time to withdraw from Afghanistan and leave our allies and Americans behind. Something I know about since I am the only member of Congress who actually conducted the first overlay in rescue of Americans out of Afghanistan after they were left behind. I will also note that this is the same people saying that pulling away is going to increase ISIS's presence. Is this not the exact same government that said that nation-building was a great strategy for Iraq? Is this not the same government who utilized and helped implement the 2005 Iraq Constitution that implemented Article 76 that sets forth sectarian democracy giving rise to Iran's political stronghold? I have spent seven years of my life in Iraq over almost three years in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Pakistan, Northern Somalia, been blown up twice in 2006, my broad star recipient and proud combat veteran. I can tell you that the 20-plus years that we served in Iraq in Afghanistan had it been a counterterrorism operation or counterinsurgency strategy, I could fully have gotten behind that. But we continue to play political football, and that's exactly what the dangers of these AUMFs are. They allow people to basically do carte blanche with warfare, and that is not the intent. In fact, I would argue that we have already lost the advantage and we should be refocusing our efforts on what is happening in our southern border, where just a day ago we had two Americans who was killed by what I would consider to be a worthy adversary, which is the cartels. So we sit here today and I'm not going to talk about the arguments of the $86 billion that we left behind when we talk about the ISIS build-up, let's talk about the ISIS build-up. What about ISIS course sign? What about Hakani Network? What about the Taliban who has $86 billion in weapons, armament, defense products, millions of dollars of pallets of cash? They are now the closest to being a true caliph with an actual sovereignty in its borders in a recognized government. That is who we need to be concerned with, because we I went to Afghanistan, I thought it was to help to fight from this becoming a safe haven of terrorism. And instead, we have actually promoted funded trained and actually made it a safe haven of terrorism. The American people is not about endless wars. The American people is about us being involved in things that we have control over. And unfortunately, due to the political football and the fact that it was the suits, not the boots making the decisions, we have no clear military objective and that is why this is continue to be a failure. Would that yield back?",

It's an honor to have so many of you stay up so late. It was a little bit of a tense night up there. I know you have all great news, but I'll tell you this is a shining point of the night. You know, they said this couldn't happen that our district was just too partisan, too entrenched, that the attitude is too expensive and that the odds just too long. But handshake by handshake, call by call, let me think room by, let me think room, vote by vote, you, all of you prove that law. We stood up for common sense solutions, we stood up for Jersey values. And because of you, Democrats, Republicans and independents, I stand before you tonight, honor to be the next Congressman for the Vizs of the United States. Friends, let me tell you why I am so proud tonight. I'm so proud because here in New Jersey, from prime as to burdened Washington Township to Ringwood, we showed the country that there's a new kind of politics taking shape. Yes, this campaign season from the top down may have been dark and divisive, but in part since your ahead of problems on it. Pitting one party against another. But here are the fifth rejected back. Did we talk tough? You bet. Did we disagree from time to time? Hey, it's New Jersey. But at the end of the day, we keep together to get things done. It's why I ran and led you, I believe, that most of what we need to do to build a strong future for New Jersey has nothing to do with Democrat or Republican issues. They are fifth district issues, and that's what we're going to get done. Lowering taxes to make life more affordable on attract jobs and businesses is not a partisan issue. It's a fifth district issue. Facing our roads and bridges and ensuring our kids have good education and clean drinking water isn't a partisan issue. It's a fifth district issue, standing by veterans, law enforcement, EMS and firefighters, isn't a partisan issue. It's a fifth district issue. Fighting town abroad and at home isn't a partisan issue. It's a fifth district issue. And ensuring that women get people pay for equal work and decide what's best for their health. Is it a partisan issue? It's a fifth district issue. Treating each other with respect, no matter who you love, where you're from, where you're worship, or what you look like, is an partisan issue. It's a fifth district issue. There's a lot I have read for Congress because I believe like you do that here in New Jersey, we share common values, Jersey values. The values that I learned growing up here. I also learned that getting things done for you is a job of a member of Congress. And that's what I'll do when I take the oath in January. Thank you. Thank you. Applause. Applause. Applause. You see we're standing for real practical solutions of people. There's a very big tent. And ideology has no place. That's what I've heard from all of you. I heard it from CGO's like A.D.S. And local Republican leaders like Councilman Alamedra, from North Thail, and Mary Harry Shortway from Vernon, who put progress ahead of party. Because they know the extrusion of my land, it was spot on people's. But ideology has never built a bridge. Educated a kid, or in Mary Shortway's case, secure the money to buy a new fire truck. That's why I remember if Congress, I will fight for all of you, all of us, here in the fifth. Regardless of you voted for me, because that's the job. And I expect you to hold all of us accountable. Now before I go, let me share a few other things really quick that I learned along the way. First, campaigns are a team sport. This was a tough campaign. Well, one of us, the victory, was a team of people, a team so smart and dedicated, that it just, no matter what the hour was, they were there. And believe me, I called it all hours. The first among them, and I am just so proud of her, and what she did for us. Our fearless leader, my campaign manager, Alan's ball. Not a small number. And David's 65 years old. Have we gone. To Alex, our whole campaign team, Amanda, and Jean, Jordan, Zach, Glendale, and others on the outside to help me stop somewhere in Mark Pett and to my brilliant strategist, Adam Silverstein. To Sam, we'll be here a few years ago to have our first conversation about what it's going to take to get this done. You all did this. This is your night too. Thank you and I'll never forget it. To my brilliant colleague, by the way, I had to raise a lot of money and the countless donors who helped make this possible, thank you. And special thanks to my campaign treasure, Ron Combe. The great friend, like Chisha Droga, who's stunned to die from breathing in the toxins of ground zero, and Jamie Hayson, who's 12 there too, and the days after 9-11 and then lend their voices to our effort. Thank you because they believe like I said now for two years that we always have to stand by those who stand by us. To our brothers and sisters in labor who are there from the beginning, I thank you for the bottom of my heart, for your heart work. The National Association of Realters, I don't know if you've seen their ads, who represent small businesses across communities in our district, and great new Jersey companies like Johnson and Johnson 18 team Verizon among so many other who took a risk on us early on. I'm so grateful because creating jobs is an important issue and I will wake up every day working to bring more jobs and businesses here in North Jersey because it's all about jobs and business. I'm so grateful to my parents and mom who's down here, my dad is on there, and my stepfather, my in-laws came in the name, Brad and Harper and Estella, I love you all. And when it comes to thank yous, I say I'm willing to jump, I forgot that. I miss Emily and Jeff and sorry. If I sister Emily and her up in Jeff, that would have gone down well, thanksgiving. Now when it comes to thank yous, I saved my immediate family, I'm most important for last. To run it for office in this day and age, you either have to be crazy like Bill or have a really good reason. I'll leave it up to decide which one you can decide yourself, but for me, the good reason is right here next to me is better. I'm not going to be a problem work. To my beautiful and brilliant wife, Marlon. The fact that that is still talking to me proves that I've married up way up. To Ben and Ellie or everything to me guys, I want you to know that. The worst part about this campaign has been the time I had to spend away from you. But the reason I ran was because of you. I want to say, I'm just really privileged to live with two women who I love dearly, and one young man who I want to grow up respecting women. So keep it up there, and I'm sure you do that. We have a couple of other questions. One last story. About three weeks ago, I think it was a Saturday. I was sitting at the kitchen table, stack of papers, working on the campaign, busy head down. I was going to sit down with you. All of a sudden, I thought it was dropped on my lap. It was from Ellie. I wanted to read you a little part of that. You said, dear daddy, thank you for working hard and still spending time with me. I'm very proud of you. You're doing a really great job. I will love you if you lose, but if you win, I will be the same amount as happy. I love you so much Ellie. I love you so much too, Ellie and Ben and Marla. I'm the same amount as happy. And I always work to make you proud. And to all of you, finally, I'm going to say thank you. You've all worked so hard to make this happen. These are team sports for all of us. And I just go from the bottom of my heart, I will never ever forget what you did for me. Knock it on doors, talking to people, and always getting my back. And remember, we live in the greatest country in the world. And our best day is the amount of what we face are always ahead of us. Thank you, God bless you, God bless you.",

        "transcript": " So I get that question more than any other. So why are you going for Congress or why you want to be elected official? This is my backyard. This is where I was born in Morriggas. I was born here in Central Florida. I grew up just like so many other Americans that are here, so many other Floridians. I came from a broken home where my mom and dad both suffered from drug addiction and drug abuse. They were in and out of the jail and prison systems. I made my father, he did more time in prison than what some people would get for a committee worker. And that was just the way the judicial system worked back then. But I was lucky with my grandparents. They actually took me and adopted me and became my actual parents. And so that was that whole first introduction to what is a nuclear family. We were very traditional. We ate it. The dinner table every single night, unless my grandfather was a welder, didn't get back in time. My grandmother and I would wrap his plate and put it in the oven until they came home type thing. And you don't like it that 20, 30 minutes, like many kids who come from a blue collar family where they talk to their dad right before they get to bed because they have class the next day type thing. We would be church every single Sunday. It was a technical family here in Central Florida. Obaminate to say we're so big on our guns and vibos, right? That really is though. Central Florida, the beltway, kind of blue collar America. And where we grew up. So having raised in like that kind of work ethic where it was all about what you put into something is what you get out of it. And that was what my grandfather was. When I went to high school, again, right here in the eye for a corridor area, it was one of those things where going in wrestling in high school and playing football in high school, these were things that just came natural about work ethic. It's about working hard. I mean, even coach Harley Arrested coach just to say, hard times make hard mint. And I was remembered that and we're in hard times right now. We're in hard times economically. We're in hard times here in Central Florida, especially with the open border crisis with regards to opioid addiction and all the things that my family still struggles with today. So it's important to understand where I came from is no different than every other American in this area. You're many of the Americans in this area. I noted this to Chrome poverty. I noted this to eat rice and tomato gravy three nights out of the five. And I said, I don't know, it's one of the things that I used to hate. Now all of a sudden, I create this sometimes when I go back home, I last my grand thought of, I can't make this in some corporate. And you know, just kind of get back to like, you know, what it was as far as that whole state will be eating. But you know, knowing how hard our family worked and knowing the opportunities that our country's given us, that's why I went into the military. That's why I wanted to serve our nation, the greatest nation in the world. And that's why, you know, even though we went off and we fought these endless wars, which are not for these aren't wars that are selected by the soldiers. These aren't wars that are, you know, necessarily picked or voted on by the war fighter. They're voted on people, you know, hundreds of miles away and Washington DC, who don't understand what these wars actually involve. They don't understand the ramifications to these endless wars in this nation building that George W. Bush mentality. And that's why we need more veterans who are in Congress who understand what happens wherever they vote for these wars and who understand the ramifications and what we need to do after the war fighter needs to battlefield. That's what it's about. It's about getting down to the people who understand what it is to be doing so correct.",

        "transcript": " recognized. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. Thank you to my distinguished colleague from Florida, Mr. Gates. And I also want to thank my colleagues, Mr. James and Mr. Zinky for they like myself are combat veterans who understand the total cost of warfare. Now, before I get into my statement, I want to address a couple of things that was made by my colleagues here today. We talked about the idea that we are here to preserve freedoms and we are here to preserve democracy. But let's talk about our role in democracy. When we went into Iraq in 2003 under the auspice that we were there for weapons of mass destruction and to liberate the people of Iraq. Only two years later, did we supplement this with the 2005 Iraq Constitution, whereby Article 76 and its own design created sectarian democracy that gave rise to the Iranian control, which ultimately gave rise to China's domination. You know, we are not a nation-building element. We are war fighters. We are there to conduct counterterrorism operations when needed, but only at the expense that it is to the benefits of the American national security and US interests. Now, he talked about timely, but I ask you, Mr. Speaker, we started our operations in Mugat issue in the early 90s. We started the operations in Afghanistan in 2001. We started the operations in Iraq in 2003. So by what definition do we determine is timely? You know, the idea that my colleague and rightfully so and I agree with him, Mr. James said about the repeal and Replace piece of the AUMF, which I do view as an abdication of our roles and responsibilities as legislators under the Constitution and Article 1 clause 8. But it does have a replacement and I just stated it and it's called the United States Constitution War authorities. At no point in time can you find in the Constitution where it says we can repeal our rights as legislators under the Constitution to put in something which abdicates our roles and responsibilities for 20 plus years. On an AUMF that was designed and now being abused by presidents on the left and the right, who have been using it for its non-intended purposes. And while I agree with my colleague, Mr. Gates, that Afghanistan is completely not relevant to the discussion that was made, we're talking about an area whereby President Biden utilized political optics over military strategy, endangering the lives of our military when we know that it was a conditions base withdrawal. But one thing was actually stated as correct, which is the threat in which China possesses when it comes to the Africa continent and that a vacuum could be created. But let's go ahead and focus on what China's ultimate goal is because it is not kinetics. It is not about the bomb to bomb gun to gun or bullet to bullet mechanism. It is about the economic and resource warfare impact. It is about the Belt and Road Initiative, which expands out the Eurasian border, takes over Africa, Oceania, cuts off Western hemisphere supply chain, and an effort to utilize the WHO, WEF, and OPEC to eliminate the US dollar from the global currency. So let's address that issue, which is not one that is done by kinetics and war fighters, but by a whole of nation approach that deals with treasury, that deals with the economic buildout, that deals with strengthen the industrial base at home, that stops the reliance on the very adversaries that we pay to slap us around every day. And this idea that we're going to play this terrorist whack-a-mole, where every time one pops up we send a new force, does nothing to actually try and help with stabilization. And let's talk about our interactions. We had a terrorist organization known as Al-Qaeda Arabian Peninsula that was based in a small portion in the Gulf of Aden, out in Yemen, and it wasn't until our drone strikes that caused numerous civilian casualties, that did we not play right into the ideology that Americans are here to destroy us and kill us due to our religious beliefs. We were actually the reason that Al-Qaeda Arabian Peninsula continued to grow. And my colleague on the left who I have a great deal of respect for, and we sit on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Meeks, he talks about the fact that we've had no Americans killed in Somalia, but that's absolutely false. And in fact, we just had another soldier killed in 2018, as a result of an explosion that resulted in three more. And also in 2017, where we had three more killed that was there. You know, as someone who has had to go visit Arlington Cemetery, or many occasions to see my brothers that are no longer here with me today, I don't think that we need to spare one more life of American bloodshed and an effort that we don't have a clear strategic military objective to begin with. And so I ask that we look at not being isolationists as we're always called and considered, but also not interventionists. Our goal is to be protectionists, protection of our constitutional rights, our sovereignty, and the American people. That is our role. And we keep talking about this 2001 AUMF that we were to repeal. Well, let's go through this. In 2019, the amendment to the 2020 NDA to repeal 2002 AMF was stripped out in its final version. In November 14, 2018, the resolution introduced to assert Congress's war power authorities in Yemen, the Rules Committee stripped the resolution in its procedural privilege. And then soon after, the Rules Committee stripped privilege from all war power resolutions for the remainder of the 115th Congress. We keep talking about what we're going to do, but I've seen very little action. And see, this is one of the reasons that I ran for Congress. Because there's too many politicians who like to talk and not enough statesmen who are willing to act. And I knew a little thing about action, considering that between my military and government experience, I've spent over seven years of my life in Iraq. Almost three years of my life in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Pakistan, and guess what? Northern Somalia and the Puntland areas of Hargasa and Berbera. I can tell you very clearly that what we are doing right now in our procedures is not making us safer. And we must start to look at a real change in order to try and protect America, so advocating your rules and responsibilities and start leading from the front with that I yield.",

        "transcript": " and ask for refuge from violence, from persecution, and from fear. All of us can agree that the process of processing and grating asylum or not must be orderly, but it also must be humane. And as a father, as a dad, I can't imagine anything worse than having one's child torn from their arms. And as a Jewish American, I am horrified by the echoes of this policy with our own people's history. Promising a bath or a shower as a roof to separate families, treating small children like common criminals, locking them up in cages at a warehouse converted border detention facility, opening tents cities to house migrant children, denying them the love and support of their parents. In the face of this horror, nearly 3,000 children forcefully separated from their parents by our government, we cannot look away, and we will not look away. We cannot become numb to what is happening. We will elevate the stories of these families, suffering unimaginable trauma, and we will make sure that the country pays attention in the midst of this moral crisis. And that is why we are here today. We are here to say that this must stop now. We are here to invoke that adage, as they say, of never again. Those families, those children escaping persecution and violence, seeking a better life in these United States, only to have their families torn apart. Again, we cannot and will not look away or go numb. We will fight for them every step of the way. Because tearing apart these families does nothing no matter what you hear to make our country safer. Instead, it is a betrayal of our country. It is an attack on our value and it diminishes us all. We should listen to the outcries of protests from religious leaders of all faiths, from political leaders like the first lady herself. And look at this group here today. We come from many backgrounds and sometimes we disagree with each other. But we will stand together in the face of a clear injustice, make no mistake. We will not allow this administration's cruel policies to tarnish our country, the attorney general, the Secretary of Homeland Security. They have the power to stop this crisis and we will not let off. We will not give in until they do. They will stop the family separations and allow the immigrants the right to seek safety and asylum without fear for their children, without being them taken from them as cruel punishment. As long as this president, as long as this administration, tears apart immigrant families, whether it's at the border or through arrests and detentions all over the country, whether it snatches them in schools or court houses or other public places, please know that the ADL stands with our civil rights here colleagues today. We stand with these immigrant families here today and we stand with these children now and forever because we will never, we will never stop fighting for our shared values of fairness and equality and for our vision of America as a nation that believes in and strides for justice and care treatment to all. Sure now if I might let me introduce Jonathan Danchkauski from Illinois. I am so proud to be here today with all these stalwarts who are standing up against the unspeakable cruelty that we're seeing. What do you call a country that institutionalizes child abuse? Sadly today you call that country the United States of America. I am the daughter, the proud daughter of immigrant parents and this is what America is about it is a country that is made by and for immigrants and the Trump administration is trying to redefine what America is. They took the words we are a country of immigrants out of the mission statement of the immigration and naturalization service. They want to say we are not an immigrant country but they cannot and they will not and Americans, jaws are dropping, their hearts are breaking as they hear the voices of children yelling daddy, daddy when they see a two year old standing there screaming those images that are coming to us. So we call on President Trump who lies about whose responsibility it is. It is his, it is the Attorney General of the United States Jeff Session and we say stop it because you can and let's have families reunited now. Thank you. Cindy Manavales from New Life. Good afternoon. When I started this, over 30 years ago my mother left Honduras with my two-year-old brother and her one-year-old daughter me. I was the age of my daughter America at the time when it came to the U.S. She left because she simply wanted safety and a chance for her children to live. When Border Patrol officers stopped her, she was allowed to keep us with her. The time when family unity was viewed as sacred marked period when the U.S. acknowledged the humanity and all individuals regardless of their background. Due to this administration's zero tolerance policy, 2000 children, 2000 children have been taken away from their parents in a 43 day window. President Trump, you are using our babies and our children as hostages. This policy violates multiple international recognized human rights and creates deep emotional harm and trauma to these families. The affected human beings are parents seeking asylum and legal humanitarian protection in the U.S. Your administration's zero tolerance policy means that often migrants are deported before ever being allowed to apply for asylum. This policy is your choice, Mr. President, one that is literally torturing small children. President Trump, you can stop separating families by rescinding it now. No laws say that we have to separate families at the border. No laws say that we have to have zero tolerance for people who are fleeing violence and death. The ROTG Act of 1980 does say that the Attorney General should establish a procedure for migrants to apply for asylum every year. Further, in so far as all of us are global citizens, we subscribe to a set of rights that transcends borders. Human rights. Article 3 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that the right to life, liberty and personal security knows no borders. Article 5 says that the right to freedom from torture and degrading treatment, no borders. President Trump and the land of the free, this needs to be recognized. Or else, we disgrace our nation in the great value of our commonly shared humanity. I invite you, President Trump, to stand with your fellow humans and recognize this humanitarian crisis for the apolitical situation it truly should be. Rest in this policy now. For those watching at home, we need your help to keep families united. In difference, it's a killer. Tax united to 52886 to send a message to your member of Congress. To keep families together, tax 52886 to keep families together. We are bearing witness to the dehumanization of an entire population and we must act even if getting involved inconveniences us by disrupting our normal routines. To do so, effectively denies the humanity of these families. Tax united to 52886. I'm going to end with a story. Earlier this month, while traveling from San Antonio, I saw four mothers at the airport who had been detained for the last three months for crossing the border without documentation. Instead of seeing four broken and helpless individuals who had been ripped from their children and their only reason for living, I saw four mothers smiling with their children in hand. Never mind that they had only the simple clothes that they wore and recyclable yellow bags to hold all that they carried. They had each other, they had their children, and they were safe from untold, violent, and cool to see that they fled. It's all I asked my fellow neighbors and Americans. At night, when these mothers put their children to bed and turn off the lights and their children say, Mommy, I'm scared. They can say Mommy is here. Thank you. Melanie Campbell of Black Women's Roundtable. Thank you, Reverend Sharp here, Janet, and all my colleagues here today. I will be brief. This is a cool day. The unjust White House policy to separate 2,000 children from their parents at the Mexican border who are fleeing for their lives seeking asylum from violence and persecution in their home countries is tantamount to government sanctions, child abuse. This administration is using babies and their armies, all of our babies, as pawns to build the wall of the border and using quote unquote rule of law as their excuse to commit these inhumane atrocities. I say and we say, shame on President Trump and shame on the GOP Congressional leadership for choosing partisan gain over human rights and compassion for the least of these God's children that are being traumatized and ripped apart from the mothers and fathers. We all have to ask ourselves this question, what kind of nation are we becoming? If we continue to allow babies, little girls and boys to be put in cages and left alone, unnurtured, wailing and crying themselves to sleep at night, we have to ask ourselves, what kind of nation are we becoming? We must all speak up and challenge these immoral acts by our governments. That is not pleased and voters of good conscience will remember this in November. Thank you. Christian Clark, President and Executive Director of the Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights. Good morning. We are here today, United Black, Brown, White, Christian, Jewish and Muslim to speak out against one of the greatest humanitarian and political crises of our time. Holding children hostage in concentration camps is the new political bargaining chip of this administration and it is unconscionable. We have all seen the reports of the children being held behind chain linked cages forced to sleep on cold floors draped in a single tinfoil blanket that an apple a day and a few cups of water. Teenagers feeding babies make no mistake as Melanie noted this is government sanctioned child abuse. Despite the president's claims separating immigrant families is not mandated by the law, this is the result of this administration's own intentional and callous action, a policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. This action has undermined our country's standing on the world stage and invited condemnation from every corner of this country and every corner of the globe. According to Black El Salvador Guadamala and Honduras are facing a surge of violent pushing, those most vulnerable to seek asylum here in the U.S. and instead of extending a hand to those most vulnerable women and children forced to leave their homes, our Attorney General continues his attack on immigrants. Reversing a ruling by an immigration court that makes it more difficult for those who seek asylum. Prior to claim, fears of domestic abuse or gang violence as legitimate reasons to gain entry into the U.S. When Sessions cites the Bible as an attempt to justify this immoral and humanitarian crisis, we are reminded that this isn't the first time that this country has deployed religion to rationalize and promote the spread of evil. The Bible has been exploited to justify slavery, attacks on the LGBTQ community and white supremacy. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has once again made clear the bias and hostility that informs his outlook on the law. He is incapable of carrying out his duties fairly and with independence. Now is the time for all Americans to speak out. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, the silence of the good people is more dangerous than the brutality of the bad people. We call on the Senate to act now to reign in this administration's outrageous, unlawful and inhumane conduct. It's time to stop tweeting and time to act. The apathy and silence of our elected officials is deafening and those who choose to act and we ask from fear of losing their base or fear of retaliation by a presidential tweet are complicit and must be held accountable. When we reflect on this moment in time, will this Congress be remembered as a passive witness to a humanitarian crisis? Now is not the time for inaction. To those in Congress who choose politics over morality, be willing to live with the incalculable damage your silence will cause a generation of children. Thank you. Let me acknowledge with us, who are standing with us from the National Center for Transgender Equality, Mara Kessling. Let me acknowledge Dr. E. Fay Williams of the National Congress of Black Women and Reverend Andrea Alexander of the National Council of Churches. Let me say that we again stand collectively, we stand firmly and let me make a personal note to Attorney General Sessions who makes such a case about here as being a Sunday school teacher and a practice in Christian. Don't quote the Bible, read the Bible. There was a baby 2,000 years ago who an angel according to the scripture told his father, Joseph, that you should flee because they're going to try and kill the baby. Joseph got married, his wife and the baby and fled to Egypt. He was a refugee because he was seeking refuge in Egypt. The reason I stand here Attorney General Sessions is I believe in a refugee from Bethlehem so I cannot look on the inhumanity to refugees from Mexico. I'm just glad that they didn't have someone in Egypt that was Trump like that snatched Jesus from Mary's aunt. I'm going to take two or three questions. Well folks are asking questions. I just wanted to note, it's pretty hot here today. Imagine that you were hundreds or thousands of children. Imagine you were in a tent. Imagine you were 45 minutes outside of El Paso, Texas. You don't have to imagine that. This is happening right now. There is a tent city and apparently according to this administration more to come. That's the reality that we're living in today and it is a reality that we can stop this. This is within the power of Attorney General Sessions and Donald Trump despite their intentions to so confusion and despite their outright lies about who's responsible, they are responsible, they are accountable, they own this policy and President Trump and Attorney General Sessions have the power to end it. It is a disgrace and a shame that we would be housing children in tent cities out in the desert. Thank you. Thank you. All our social justice leaders for being here today. This concludes the press conference but I'm sure everybody will be available for questions. Thank you, Congressman Sessions. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Capital police had set out a plan. I guess a couple of weeks ago. Is that right? Was there a plan in place that everyone been advised what to do if something went wrong? The plan was inadequate. And I'm happy to go through the chronology of events that took place from by time in the chamber on work. Absolutely. What happened, Congressman? We were in the gallery, socially distancing, while listening to the electoral college session. We were in the midst of the objection to date over Arizona when we started getting messages from our staff that violent protesters motivated by insightful language from President Trump had reached the Capitol. And then only a few minutes later, they had to evacuate the Vice President, the Speaker, and the majority leader. We were then told to pull out our gas mask as they secured the chamber, because they had to use bang gun and gas in the Ritunda to repel folks who were trying to get in the chamber. You could hear them banging. You hear the pop, pop, pop sound of the bang gun. And then we were evacuated, as you could hear, the banging of doors by protesters trying to get into the house chamber. We were evacuated down in the state area and secure as the Capitol police. It cures the Capitol once again, and make no mistake about it. We will proceed with the date, with the electoral college session, and at the end of it, the end of crack, and many Republicans will join us to certify the results of Joseph Biden as the next cousin next state. Congressman, are you safe and are your colleagues safe? Was there ever a point where you might have been in danger? I am safe. There was a moment where I just take cover lying on the ground, slap. As you could hear, popping sound of what I wasn't sure whether it was gunshots. Now, until they were bang guns, that's his first crowd. And also, there was peer gas. We had to stay there for a few minutes. You could hear folks trying to breach and take chamber, banging away. And then we were brought escorted by Capitol police out of the chamber eventually. And down through the hall, there were folks who had tried to breach the chamber on the ground, led spread, and secured who had come just within feet of us in the chamber, as I left. Are you saying within feet they got that close? Within feet, as I left the chamber doors, they were already on the ground having the police having arrested them. What's your reaction to this even happening? I mean, we've seen protest on the hill before, but this wasn't a protest. This turned into essentially an assault on one of the icons of America. This was a violent invasion and insurrection of the Capitol during the electoral power session, the main bite in the next present that state. It was incited by vitriolic and violent rhetoric of President Trump. And there will need to be consequences. Democracy came so close today, but we will finish our business. We will stand by, and we will do our jobs. Is it going to be difficult to do that job? I mean, you're going to go back tomorrow, I gather. There won't be anything happening tonight. There may even be a continuation of the session tonight that has not been decided yet. But we will finish our jobs. There will be a debate. And I urge my colleague, extremist Republicans, on the other side of the aisle, who have been using insightful, violent rhetoric that their words have consequences, that this type of rhetoric is what caused them. And we need to come together. And you'll see a majority of Democrats and Republicans do that. But then you have President Trump inciting this violent, and there will have to be consequences to this. But we're left assured to all central Floridians. We will see a President Biden for the next two weeks. And we will be able to fully develop security for our elections, for our capital, and assess the situation in great detail through a investigation. Congressman, thanks for all you do for us. I'm glad you're safe. Boy, oh boy, what a day. Could you imagine in your lifetime ever seeing anything like this? I had hoped I'd never see something like this. But we remain resolved to defender the democracy and like generations of Americans have to pour it.",

        "transcript": " Thank you, Madam Chair. The Genies really out of the bottle on this now, so to speak, 150 million Americans are now on TikTok. That's almost half of America. They're expressing themselves in art, music, poetry, short film, comedy, among other creative expressions, and many of them are inspiring, talented, young people. But we also, in the committee, recognize there's a darker side to it, right? Since adult themes, drug and alcohol, sexualization, suicide, all major issues on TikTok, but also Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and other social media platforms. So the solution, as I see it, is to regulate TikTok and other social media platforms. And that job, Mr. Chu, as you know, really falls to us. There are real concerns. By parts and common ground we've already had. We had a federal device ban that was voted on bipartisan in the omnibus. And I co-introduced a bill with my dear friend, Representative Kamik, about notices of that federal ban. Madam Chair, I think the first key is privacy. We have to pass the comprehensive legislation that got out of this community, but eluded us in the last Congress. I'm really hoping we can get that done, and I'm really excited about hearing that from folks. The other thing is that TikTok needs to be an American company with American values, and it ties to the Chinese Communist Party. This is something that will be critical as we look and go forward. And then three, we all agree we have to protect our kids. The committee should consider banning the use for children under 13 of not just TikTok, but also social media platforms, or at least empower parents. In addition, have rules of the road for teens that are 13 to 17, so that families can do it right for their families. So for privacy, that's on us. Internet privacy is on us. As far as being an American company, Mr. Chu, as you know, the committee on foreign investment in the United States at the Department of Treasury reviews foreign investment that affects national security. Right now they've negotiated with your company about this oracle setup that you've talked about servers in American company in American Texas, and then oracle would monitor the algorithms. But pressure is mounting. So Mr. Chu, would TikTok be prepared to divest from bite dance in Chinese Communist Party ties if the Department of Treasury instructed you all to do so? A congressman, I said in my opening statement, I think we are need to address the problem of privacy I agree with you. I don't think ownership is the issue here with a lot of respect. American social companies don't have a good track record with data privacy and user security. I mean, look at Facebook and Cambridge and the litigah, just one example. So I do think that, you know, it is not about ownership, it is a lot about making sure we have project Texas, making sure that we are protecting and firewalling us as user data for Mount Wanda for an access, giving third parties to come in to have a look at this, and making sure that everybody is comfortable. We are giving transparency and third party monitoring. And that is what we are doing for project Texas. Well, I would at least encourage you all to start having the dialogue. Should that be where the president in the congress ends up going? The third thing is on parents. I had a constituent of mine, Brandy of Lake known as Seyama, a parent of two teenagers, 14 and 18 years old, both of whom have been harmed by social media. TikTok's algorithm supply my 14 year old son with a continuous stream of inappropriate content and has negatively influenced his perception of all females. I noticed the attentions to the end of both of my teens' chains are decreased dramatically. And social media has made my daughter insecure leading to an eating disorder and ultimately depression. What safeguards do you have and what should we tell Brandy of Lake known about how we can help her protect her children? We have a differentiated experience. I mentioned just now about the experience if you are below 13, very, very restricted. If you are below 13 to 17 congressmen, we actually have a whole series of things. First the content that you see, we make sure that we remove things that could be mature things from your feet. We also, by default, do not allow under 16 to use direct messaging. We do not allow under 16 to, we set the accounts to private by default. They can go viral. If you are below 18, we shot off some features for you. For example, you are not allowed to post live streams. Neither are you allowed to send virtual gifts. So we take this very seriously and we want to continue to build to ensure that we are giving our under 18 teenagers on our platform. Although today, there are only a minority of our user base today, but we still take it very seriously. Mr. Chiu, I'd encourage you to continue thinking about how to get the word out to parents across the nation on some of these tools as well. As we hear, craft a privacy law that will help provide well-needed regulation and social media companies across the nation. Thank you. I know you'll back. Gentlemen, yields back. Chair, recognize the gentleman from Indiana.",

        "transcript": " Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. My name is Francie Newsom-Fyfer, and I'm the Vice President for Federal Relations at Rutgers. I'm based in Washington, DC. I'm also a member of the teaching team here at Eglton, and I have the great pleasure of kicking off the Eglton Institute of Politics, Albert Lueit, endowed lecture today. The Albert W. Lueit, endowed lecture, was established by Mrs. Benjamin Leon in memory of her brother who worked on Capitol Hill in the 1940s for both Senator Warren Barber and later Senator Albert Hawks, both of New Jersey. The annual lecture is presented by a current or former member of Congress, congressional staffer or an expert on Congress. I would like to take a moment to thank the Lueit family and the supporters of the Institute's Public Program Series for making conversations like today possible. I'd also like to take a moment on behalf of Eglton to thank the Institute's co-sponsors of today's program for their support. The Rutgers Center for Social Justice Education and LGBT Communities. The Rutgers Center for Latino Arts and Culture. The Rutgers Center, the Rutgers University Alumni Association, finally. Now it is my distinct pleasure to welcome U.S. Congressman Darren Soto. Elected in 2016, Congressman Soto represents Central Florida's ninth congressional district, which includes all of Oceola and parts of Orange and Polk counties, including Eastern Orlando, Kissamy, and St. Cloud. Representative Soto is a Ringwood, New Jersey native who credits his parents for his strong work ethic. He is a graduate of Rutgers University here in New Brunswick and the end of the George Washington University School of Law. In a short time in Congress, Representative Soto has helped to pass major bills to increase hurricane preparedness, hold foreign offshore drillers accountable, protect marine life, and to honor veterans. He currently serves on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the House Committee on Natural Resources. The first Floridian of Puerto Rican descent to serving Congress. Soto is a proud member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. He is also a member of the New Democrat Coalition, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and the LGBT Equality Caucus. Reflecting on his path to Congress in 2017 interview with Rutgers today, Congressman Soto said, it is a fight to get a seat at the table where there is a lot of money and a lot of famous names. We are grateful for the time he is taking today to share his expertise and insights about that fight with his alma mater. We look forward to hearing about the Congressman's path to politics and his advice for those who aspire to follow his example. Leading our conversation this afternoon is my colleague, Dr. Elizabeth Maddo. Dr. Maddo directs Eagleton Center for Youth Political Participation, which leads research, education, and public service efforts designed to encourage and support the political learning of high school and college students and civic action among young adults. Throughout today's program, we encourage our audience members to submit questions via the Q&A box. Dr. Maddo will turn to audience questions for Representative Soto during the latter half of the program. Thank you again very much for joining us today, Congressman. I will hand things over now to our excellent moderator, Dr. Maddo. Thanks so much. Thank you so much, Francine. Thank you, Congressman Soto, for joining us this morning. I'm really happy to be leading the conversation and look forward to discussing with you your pathway to office, your approach to public service. Certainly, a core component of the mission of the Eagleton Institute of Politics is to really link the study of politics with the practice of politics. So this conversation today promises to do just that for our students, but really for the broader Rutgers community. So we'd love to just begin by obviously you are proud Rutgers alum and we're thrilled to have you. Maybe thinking back on your time here at Rutgers, if there were any pivotal moments that sparked your interest in public service or any experiences while you were at Rutgers that fostered the skills or the mindset to engage in a life of public service. Well, there were really flashes of political interest that I had, but I could honestly say whether it was through Rutgers or through GW. I didn't realize I was ever going to be running for the state legislature or Congress, but there were moments. So when I was in high school, I participated in my then Congresswoman, Marj Rocamas, International Congress. Although I was kind of a wallflower there, to be honest, a lot of kids really knew their stuff and I was just getting into it. Then went on to boy state New Jersey. That one was more of a mark. I made it to President of the Senate and passed one of the only bills, a bill that at that time make the lottery budget public for to make sure it was going to education. So that was a real exciting moment. When I got to Rutgers, you know, I was very interested in history and I was an economics major. And so from my historic studies, particularly of American history, that was that lend to hand, but also probably the work I did as a social chair and as a rush here of a local fraternity, Alpha Cairo at the time, that got me in the mix with folks having to introduce myself, having to make persuasive arguments for people to join. I would have never known that was a pathway, but it was. I went on to GW law and was going to school or nation's capital. Rutgers was a great preparation for that law school education. And even then, I always voted. I always paid attention to what was going on in politics, but I was kind of turned off by, you know, the snobby nature seemed like I've even the interns over there. So even while I was at GW, I'm concentrating on my studies and I never went to the White House ones and never went to the capital ones. And it wasn't until I got down to Florida that some of these fundamentals that I learned really started to take shape. I had to create a new law firm and with a relative of mine and we're trying to get out there so I joined the young Democrats to meet people. And it was a somber group because I joined just after John Kerry had lost in 2004. And just to show how politically sensitive I was in the situation, I was wondering why everybody was depressed because I had already gotten over it from my vote in early November. But that's when the very next meeting I became the vice chair, the vice president of the Young Democrats of Communications. I used some of the skills that I learned actually to recruit and develop social events and as a rush chair to create a event called the Speakeasy, which is a social event that we had at that time, 2004 was pretty groundbreaking. We had it at an LGBT local bar but it expressed our values as young Democrats. We had a political speaker come in who could only speak for five minutes and then it was a happy hour. And we built up the membership from about 25 to 150 members in a matter of a few months. I didn't know there'd be synergy though. I never occurred to me that one of us would decide to run for office. Another would decide to be their campaign manager. We all would start knocking on doors together and I started as a volunteer. And managing reasons through that young Democrats group. And it showed me that a group of 20 somethings were willing to utilize their weekends to knock on doors for many months. It could overcome money, it could overcome better known candidates. And we got our first member elected, Scott Randolph. A few months later there was a special election. And we got the band back together and despite being outspent, having the least name recognition out of six in the primary and being outspent three to one in the general, we won both those and I found myself within a little more than a little less than two years from taking the Florida bar being in the Florida legislature. So you can see some of the fundamentals I learned through social life, through American history and through the experiences in New Jersey that eventually one day led to me getting on the path to becoming a state legislator and ultimately a member of Congress. It seems it highlights really the role of relationships. Where it was your time in your fraternity at Rutgers or with the young Democrats, that role would you say that relationships play a central role or play a role in being successful in public life and politics? As a speaker Pelosi would say relationships with currency of the realm. You have to have those relationships. I've always been very social. I've always been a people person. I enjoyed knocking on thousands of doors, talking to thousands of my constituents, those conversations over many years have informed me of the needs of the area. The literally walking eats community gives you a good sense of it as you talk to people. So definitely one path through politics is by being a people person, engaging in retail politics as one would say, shaking more hands than the next person, meeting more people than the next person. And when we're talking about state legislative races and city council races, it's still at an achievable level where you can knock on 5,000,000 doors over many months and with other young people where you could overcome the fact that you may be outspent because you're making those personal connections. But it takes a lot of work. And I think that's where people are like, how do you knock on 10,000 doors? 15,000 doors. Well, you start early and you go from many months to do it with a little help from your friends and it builds over time. Those personal connections still to this day, people when they come to my office, they're like, you knocked on my door five years ago. I remember talking to you about this, or you listen to me and you actually worked on that legislation afterwards. So those relationships, even on a massive scale, are part of what at least my brand of politics is about. You do have others who are legacies who come in with great name recognition. Their parents were in the Congress. Others who write a check for a million bucks and are already in the game, you know, there's other ways to do this. But for most of you on this call, who are not rich or famous, this is probably the more standard way to get involved in what I do. Thank you. Let's say a bit. You've indicated that your time as a lawyer advocating for clients really encouraged you to run for office at the state level. So if you could explore that decision a bit more with us. And I'm wondering in particular, are there are there ways in which holding public office can affect systemic change that's widely felt that you were felt was not being met via solely advocacy or solely representing your clients. So that importance of kind of taking that next step to really affect change. Sure. So first of all, having a strong knowledge of American history that it helped develop through the New Jersey school system and through Rutgers, so else a strong knowledge of the law was foundational. Because in addition to meeting a lot of people, you have to know stuff and you have to have ideas, a platform that you present. It's not about you. It's about how you're going to improve the lives of your constituents. So really becoming a whiz at Florida law, I studied and studied and studied for that Florida bar and did really well on it and had a good general knowledge of Florida law. So when you're running as a young person, I was 28 and turned 29 during that first election that we won. It's a double edged sword. On the one hand, people think, oh, you're naive. You don't know what you're talking about. But if you could show that you know more about Florida law than someone twice your age, suddenly now is the other side, which is you're young, you have the energy and you have the knowledge to get what needs to be done done. And it can appeal to people of all ages. And people are excited that someone of their age group is running. But a lot of older people want someone with energy. They want someone who is going to be able to do the tireless work. It takes to be a legislator, everything from the knowledge to the town halls, to the travel, to all the debates, to all the different things you have to do. So certainly having that strong Florida law background and American historical background prove pivotal, even to this day in debates where I could reference different things like the snap of the finger. And you improve it over time. I couldn't say that the undergrad may or even the law school may be able to do those things as quickly. You have many of us, if you continue to learn from your mistakes and learn from your lessons, you evolve and you learn throughout your whole life. So that's a really important lesson to learn that you're undergrad and grad degrees, even at Rutgers, are only a part of the overall learning as you progress in your careers. And yes, we saw early on through law school and through advocating for clients, there were limits to what you could do because you can't change the law when you're litigating. The law is what it is. You litigate it and argue it's the best your ability. So that was obviously motivation. I was a lawyer who wanted to write laws. I didn't run for school board. I didn't run for city council. I didn't run for any of that. And actually there was a lesson in boy state. I actually learned way longer ago that really came back up when this happened. When I was in boy state, I lost my first four elections for like fire chief, city council and county commission, but I won the Senate position in a landslide because my personality was much more even back then as they junior high school, much more lawyerly and intellectual than then I guess community organizer oriented it. And I work with a lot of community organizers. And that's another way to do it. There's some great ones there. But it was through history and having more of a legal mind even back then, although I didn't know that yet, that I was a fit for Senate, but lost every election before then. So I knew from going into it, I was a lawyer who wanted to write laws and I had worked on some civil rights cases. There was also a lack of representation among the huge Puerto Rican community in central Florida. We had a lot of folks who were of other ethnicities representing the populations. And then there were one or two Republican Puerto Ricans who were the vast majority of us are Democrats in central Florida, but the Republicans have been really sharp to put real money behind some of the Puerto Rican Republicans there. So a lot of Puerto Ricans would come down or up from the island and be like, I'm a Democrat but I'm voting for this guy apparently because he's our guy. And so when I ran, I ran against the money, but I did the hard work. And there wasn't a lot of folks before that willing to do that on the Democratic side. We had the votes there, but someone had to lead the fight to go out to get it and a martial everything together. Now, after me, it's become a very progressive community. I have folks who are now in state rep positions or school board positions or county commission seats. We've really arrived politically. We're still arriving economically down there. And frankly, a lot of folks are from New Jersey or New York who moved down to central Florida. They're the second biggest Rutgers alum populations in Florida. So that shouldn't surprise a lot of you after New Jersey that there's a lot of us in central Florida. So knowing that we needed folks who represented the majority of the values of a central Florida and to fight for things that really mattered, I passed a law to help make dreamers eligible to be in the Florida bar and to have in state tuition. I don't know if a non-Hispanic would have pushed that as hard or not someone who doesn't understand the immigrant experience. I pushed to give families coming from Puerto Rico two years before their standardized test would count. We had kids coming in not having enough time to learn the language when my dad or in men at sea moved to Patterson, New Jersey. It took him three years to really learn the language. And we were testing kids after one year and they were failing and getting held back. So those were just two key examples of having an ex my life experience had me prioritize two of those issues. And a third was after Hurricane Maria when we had so many folks coming to New Jersey as a member of Congress, it was tireless. And the beauty is we have a district where there's many of us who have strong connections to sort of your knee reekens up by you and Los Puerros which are folks from the island. And we're sort of a mixed up both and we stand solidarity with brothers and sisters on the island. But make no mistake about I represent central Florida and that's the main priority but they give me the goodwill to work and all these other things including teaming up with New Jersey delegation as different issues come up as well. And you've touched on one of the hats that I wear at the Center for Youth Political Participation is leading our young elected leaders project where we do research on young people running for office and serving in office. But that notion, this idea of the importance that activism has played as an impetus to having you run for office. Do you see that in other people of your generation? I think you indicated you served in office, you were 28, 29 when you ran for the state legislature. Is that a unique feature would you say of millennials that has maybe propelled them to run for office? So we saw some with a, I guess, a tweener like me where I'm Gen X but near millennial, starting around that 2007, 2008 time, getting back to the basics and President Barack Obama in that 2008 campaign was a community organizing and canvassing on a massive scale. I mean, even in my neighborhood, I got a knock on the door from someone from Barack Obama's campaign. And I think that really set the tone. We see millennials really taking it to another level and it's exciting because you, that is what people used to do. The interesting thing is the contrast because you have also social media. So social media is good to get some information out there to get out to a lot of people. But it also is impersonal. So even as social media becomes a great tool to get your message out there, young people and older people still want that personal connection. And in fact, because of COVID, you see the fact that for instance, the Democrats couldn't didn't knock on doors to the very end. That hurt us in many seats because of the safety issue. But I for instance, we're on a campaign where we knock on doors for months and we had to do phone banking for months and just go out in the last five weeks once and then candidate Biden was starting to canvas. So and you see that also on the Republican side too that you have increasingly young people, not only turned to new ways like social media, but understanding that social media is also cheap and personal and that you still need that personal connection. And I even argue that a lot of my millennial constituents who are now homeowners, if I just reached out to them through social media, they'd be like, yeah, anybody could do that. Anybody could tweet something out. Anybody can do a Facebook post or Facebook ad. They won't even more so want that genuine contact because of what it means to actually have an authentic two-way conversation until listen. Can you help us understand then your time in the state legislature and you know, you were encouraged to run based on that real desire to make effect that institutional change, that long-term change. Maybe talk a little bit about what encouraged you then to run for Congress. And you know, we know that you have been a very active member of Congress in your short time and service in your first term. You helped to pass the most legislation of any other freshmen in Congress. So we'd be interested, first of all, maybe if you could explore for us what encouraged you to run for Congress and your service in Congress, but then certainly talking about, I would love to then segue into discussing, you know, we're in this moment of such crisis on so many fronts, whether it is the global pandemic, the economic crises, nationwide reckoning regarding the continued effects of institutional racism, you know, the role of Congress right now, what role Congress should be playing in the lives of their constituents. So tell us about your time in Congress. Sure. So as I progressed from the State House to the State Senate to the Congress, first politics is a lot to do at timing. It's much easier to win an open seat than run against incumbent and there are these moments that come up and you either have to seize that moment or not and you have to be smart about it. So when I was in the State House, there was a new congressional seat drawn, but there was a gentleman who used to represent it, it was worth millions of dollars and he jumped in that right away. And I was like, I'm going to run for State Senate right now for the same motivations to help people to write fair and just laws and to do a policy and learn from the mistakes of history to improve the future in the quality of my constituents. But as you go further up, you have a larger ability to do it. It's true that local governments and state governments are closest to the people. But I think a lot of the focus right now for better for worse has been on the big national efforts going on. So as I have the opportunity to run for State Senate, that was the better opportunity. Iran was honored to win and to represent our community for four years in the State Senate. An open seat opens up. Frankly, this is the difference between the minor leagues and the major leagues. You know, I just sometimes remind everybody in Florida we have a state legislature because people would forget about that. But there's a lot of focus on Congress and you could do a lot of big things. And of course, as an American history buff, the greatest debates, at least from historical context and the greatest impact you could have in terms of numbers is through the Congress. We're not dealing in millions and billions, we're dealing in billions and trillions and the biggest policies affecting the nation. And so the opportunity arose. It was a dogfight in the primary. And since the seat is just democratic leaning, I always have a legit and tough general election as well. But I tend to be most comfortable in a general election, talking to everyone. But also I'm a proud Democrat and have a lot of progressive values. So I work on both those things. But at the end of the day, it was to get that ability to be in some of the greatest debates of our time to be able to do what's right for the nation. And of course, I arrived at such a crucial time in history with the election of President Trump that became a very divisive time for a lot of folks in central Florida, where a very diverse community, we have a large Hispanic population, we have a large African American population, we have a large Muslim population. All those communities were absolutely demoralized and divided during that time period. And then we have sort of your folks liberal angerals coming down from the North and more southern traditional anglos that are more conservative in the South. One of my districts voted 13 plus for Trump, two voted for Hillary Clinton. So I get in and I just from the context of history knew it was not going to be a normal time. And what really woke me up to it was when my hero, John Lewis, was attacked, an American hero. And that was really like, okay, this is not going to be George W. Bush or George Herbert Walker Bush or Ronald Reagan. This is going to be a very different type of Republican president and we need to be ready. And we fought two years to protect the Affordable Care Act that ensures we have the biggest federal exchange in Florida, in the nation in Florida, with nearly 2 million people including tens of thousands of folks getting health insurance in my district. So that was a big issue. We saw the Muslim band and trying to end DACA and the attacks on the Hispanic community. That was huge. We saw in addition, a voting rights that are protected African Americans and then the Supreme Court takes away preclearance on top of that for our state. And so it was about surviving and then 2018 taking back the House to be able to provide some balance, some accountability back into the Congress. And we by the skin of our teeth saved the ACA prevented the DACA from finally being eliminated, fought to try to preserve voting rights and LGBT rights and all these other things that were in jeopardy at the time. And then in 2018, we started to get to go on a little office and work on an appropriations package that more represented our values. And then of course, in March of last year, COVID hit. And really that was, we're talking about the worst pandemic in 100 years since 1918. Over half a million people have died to date. This is a once in a generation crisis and really the most invasive crisis to each American life since World War II. And it took me while to realize that 9-11 of course was terrible for the tri-state area, for Virginia. The whole nation was in mourning, but not everybody knew someone who passed away. When we went into the Iraq war, less than 1% of population goes to Iraq or Afghanistan. Even with the Great Recession, only 10% of folks to 12% of folks ever lost their jobs. So you still have 80-something percent of Americans that aren't affected. But now, every American is affected. We're on the Zoom call because people could die if we congregate with using bad practices. So we had to step up and we passed the CARES Act, a huge landmark bill to help prevent a recession. And you have to look at this. We're dealing with two crises. We're dealing with a pandemic and an economic recession. It's not just the Great Recession like we saw in 2007 to 2010 and beyond insurface states like in Florida. So this was a moment in time where it takes incredible leadership and unending stamina and courage to be able to, I was still going out, two events is still going out, getting on airplanes the whole time and meeting with constituents as I could. Even while there was no vaccine yet, but they needed to see that their leaders had the courage to risk our own lives. And I was happy to do that because I know that's the job. And I have one of the most populated districts in the nation because very high growth, fifth most popular, 940,000 people are in the district I represent when most are at 760. So there's a lot of folks counting on us. And now we go into a unified democratic government under Joe Biden, where in the first 100 days we're on the precipice of passing the American Rescue Act, the largest bill passed by Congress in generations. This is our new deal of this generation. And yes, there's a decent amount of funding for the response to COVID, but there's even more to bring us through the recovery in every sector and every way of life. We're going to hire 100,000 young people to help us vaccinate America. We're going to have enough funding to get enough vaccines. We're going to make sure we can have these vaccination sites across the United States with a national guard helping out. We're going to be helping with higher ed institutions like Rutgers, where I heard that the amount you all are receiving is well over $100 million to help with both the school being safe and student relief. So I could go on and on about the impact of this, but I will end by saying there's other landmark bills we're passing over this first 100 days, the Pro Act to boost labor rights. We passed HR run the four people election, a lot of protect early voting, voting rights to fight against, gerrymandering and redistricting to require presence to disclose their tax returns and to stop dark money from not being disclosed. And of course, we have also this week two gun safety bills to close the Charleston loophole and to provide universal background checks. And next week, we're going to the DREAM Promise Act to protect dreamers and TPS recipients with a pathway to citizenship as well as the Farm Work and Modernization Act to protect a pathway to citizenship. And last week, we passed the Equality Act, which would provide LGBT rights through all our civil rights statute. So some big issues coming through that in the first 100 days, that it's a narrow Senate, but we feel very good about our chances to get a lot of these things through. There may be some compromises made, but you're going to see a big difference in this first two years and the rights of so many people, so many folks left behind for so long. Thank you, Congressman. And I just want to remind that we're going to segue in a few minutes to questions from our audience. So if you have a question and you haven't submitted it yet, we want to encourage everyone to submit your question. And maybe I'll ask one more and then we'll start to address the questions that have come in. So you suggested such a vibrant, active agenda and have indicated that stamina and courage is so important to be successful in Congress. Maybe you could share with us, especially thinking of our students, what do you enjoy? What have you been, what do you enjoy about serving in office, whether it's at the state level or the national level? And maybe what are the parts that are less enjoyable? But tell us about your experience of serving in office. So I enjoy the smiling faces of my constituents when we get them their stimulus checked or we qualify them for Medicaid or Medicare, where we pass a big bill to help out dreamers or just yesterday, President Biden approved temporary protective status for Venezuela. And that was my bill in the Congress and the President of the United States basically just adopted the policy that my bill had been fighting for four years because we had to have 200,000 plus Venezuelan refugees in the United States whose status was uncertain. So being able to help those folks are great, being on American history buff legacy. When you're running for office and you're in office, you're writing a story, you're on that train and you need to, it takes a while to be fully cognizant of it. But when you're campaigning and you make promises, people expect you to keep them. They're not just empty things you say to get elected. And from there, you have to deliver and those are the legacies that you'll be tested by as well as your ethics and how you carry yourself. Do you step up? A lot of members didn't step up, but more so than not did during the crisis. And if you have health reasons, that was a legitimate reason. But otherwise, it takes heroism, it's damn known. Like I mentioned, the other thing that I appreciate is the debate. You know, over 10 years of being a litigator and 10 years of being a legislator and having that strong knowledge of the law and having that strong knowledge of American history, I go into debates looking to take people on, but in the facts, not in the personalities. I never insult members, I never call them names. If I'm going to shock everybody, it's going to be with the facts. I may say that this is all about a real litigation of the election. We all know Biden won. You may see people like, I don't want to hear about that. But I'm not talking about personalities. I'm talking about reality. Or when I say that all this is about discriminating against a particular community or about for instance, climate change being real and being human cause and being an existential threat. And that we can either lead on this or we can leave an earth to our children that will be worse than any generation before it. And some people don't want to hear that. But I enjoy the debate. I enjoy seeing my constituents' lives improved. I enjoy establishing and passing landmark bills and legislation that are part of history. All those things are the motivations. What is not as pleasant? Well fun raising is not at all pleasant, but it's required. Because I feel like that's the difference between a city council member or state legislator versus member congress raising tens of thousands of dollars versus raising millions of dollars. But the beauty of it is there's different ways to do it. We've seen particularly among our younger millennial members, they've been able to take bold positions and grand pronouncements on social media, get thousands of millions of followers and be able to get thousands of small dollar contributions. So it's not just calling wealthy folks or packs. It's about small dollar donations. It's about getting support from folks actually in your community. And that's what HR1 was all about is making small dollar contributions count more. One of many things in the Fourth People Act. So that is a tougher part of the Congress. Nailers can be vicious, TV ads can be vicious and unfair. People can attack your family. You can have your worst days advertised for months at a time, mistakes made that you wish you could go back. But look, as I said, it's this moving train. So when you make a mistake, that's it. You own it. So you better live up to it and fix it and not try to run away from it. You got to take responsibility. Truman's that are right when the buck stops here. And so that could be hard to take full responsibility for your mistakes and your successes. It could be hard to see your spouse or your family attacked for literally thousands of people to see. Or for your staff to get attacked because they made a mistake. Those things can be hard. But one thing I was blessed with is being a optimist, being someone who has a lot of energy but still calm at the same time. So I just kind of wake up the next day and it's today is the day. It's a new day. You got to just shake it off and move on because if you're able to get an office for enough time, you're going to already do other things that will eclipse whatever mistakes you made and nobody's perfect. But people do expect you to apologize and own up to things when it happens. And try not to make those mistakes to begin with. That also helps learn over time. And I believe that's been one of the real things over anything else. I hope people learn today is many of you will evolve throughout your careers. You'll be sharper in your 30s or 40s than you are right now. Some of you won't because you didn't learn from your mistakes. But I hope you all will. There's no way even as a student or as a Rutgers or a law student, I would be at the caliber I am now because it took many mistakes and many different lessons and building up my work ethic and building up my ability to remember things and recall all these things as you go up and you focus. Those are all keys that have helped me and I hope help you too. So yeah, those are great lessons, not just for our students, but for all of us. So we have a number of questions that have come in. So I want to start to address some of them. One question asks, how do you bridge the social, economic, cultural and political differences among your constituents to create a common agenda for action? And maybe even along those lines, if you can discuss a particular piece of legislation that you're working on that may offer that opportunity to bridge those differences. Sure. One of the keys is everybody cares about us bringing home projects and improving the lives of our constituents. So when we're talking about funding, everybody's part of the green party. When I'm bringing back a local college, like we brought back a new Valencia Poincyanica College or bringing Sun Rail, a community rail to my district, or expanding I-4, which a lot of people are stuck in traffic on in Jersey. I know you all know about traffic or whether it is bringing a new high tech center to the district. These were all, or helping our local citrus growers and ranchers with relief. Hurricane relief was a big part. All those issues were all, for the most part, bipartisan. Only the most hyperpartisan folks who just, it didn't matter what I did there, they're not going to be with you. But a good two thirds to three quarters of my constituents and sometimes more are supportive of those things. So always remember that the budget, at least in the individual projects you're bringing down, tends to be bipartisan. And when I was fighting for citrus relief or fighting for housing relief after hurricanes or even during the COVID relief, a lot of those letters were bipartisan. So that's important. Some policies are sorry, the next thing that's very bipartisan, constituent matters. We don't ask people what party they are. We don't look up what party they are when they call for Medicaid or they call up for stimulus, check help or they call up with help for their social security or for immigration issues. We have no idea nor would we ever care. It doesn't matter. We represent everybody in the district and we represent them equally with regard to constituent services. With regard to policy, look, you got to press that green button for yes or that red button for no. You're never going to win by 100%. You're never going to get 100% of the people to agree with you. What you do generally run on a platform and you vote those who are doing it right, vote consistent with that platform and you're representing the majority of voices in your district for that particular issue. And this is democracy. For better or worse, it is a majority rule. It needs district, majority voters that is. So don't forget to vote. That's a key part of it. So, and the last thing I'd say is you have to compartmentalize different issues and be mature about it. I may have to fight vigorously in an issue related to climate change in the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is one of the three most powerful committees in commerce. We have almost all of health care, almost all attack, environment, consumer protection, energy. It's this giant committee where 40% percent of all bills go through this committee, which is why I fought to get on it. Oh, and by the way, the chair is your representative Frank Polone. So it's good to live in New Brunswick. You have a very powerful member who I voted for twice and treats me as a nephew. He's great. So we made debate on issues related to climate change, but yesterday I went up to one of our Florida members, long serving member, very bipartisan, Gus Villarakis. He represents part of the Tampa Bay area. And we wanted to make sure the federal qualified health clinics, concerning federal vaccines in because they're getting some from the state. So there's a lot more restrictions to that. We have a lot more control over the federal programs and the state programs. So I asked him, would he be willing to write a letter with me to buy it and asking for us to get out a lot of men's of vaccines for federally qualified health clinics? And he didn't hesitate within a minute to say, you know, my father, he's a legacy by the way. My father helped pass the federal qualified health clinics. And this should be a bipartisan issue. It wasn't always, but we need to work on this. I have a lot of these in my district that helped my constituents to, yes, let's do this letter. And with he and I leading it, being on the committee, we're probably going to get most of the delegation on board. And so we may not agree on some other issues, but we just, we dust it off. Dust ourselves off and pick up from the next debate. The law really helped me practicing law really helped me with that because when you're practicing law, you could have diametrically opposite interests as the other lawyer, but you have to go through discovery and you have to share information. You have to have respect for one another. So being able to have respect, compartmentalizing issue by issue, those are some of the things that help out in Congress. And of course, as I mentioned, the budgets by partisan, constituent services of our partisan. And you try to have a policy agenda where you make some compromises, but you're always, you're never going to get 100% of people in your district to agree. Okay. Thank you, Congressman. I want to ask a question that was posed by Amanda. Amanda writes, as a fellow Puerto Rican, I'm concerned. I'm concerned about the current state of the island, especially since they don't have direct representation in our government. What is doing to help these American citizens? Well, anybody who ghouls my name will find out I am the prime sponsor of the Puerto Rico statehood bill. This all flows from how they vote on the island. My first opinion is that the current status is a failed status for the island. The island is a territory with a population bigger than about 20 something states. And we saw that, right? The failed status with the hurricane Maria with promess it and the budget cuts we saw with earthquakes were they still haven't got relief for that. And with COVID-19 that the current status is just not working. We weren't meant to have all other territories are 150,000 people or less. This is 3.2 million people, which is too big. And having one non voting member Congress doesn't work for them. And so we had three elections, but this last one was a lot different. And that it was a simple yes or no statehood question on a general election ballot. And a majority of the people voted yes. If they would have voted no, I wouldn't have taken any action because it's up to the people on the island to decide. And their Florida and New York and brothers and sisters are here to support, should be supporting them and what they want to do. But they voted yes. And so I filed the bill as the prime sponsor Jennifer Gonzalez-Colo and the resident commissioner is the co-introducer. The reason why I'm the prime sponsors because the Democrats are in charge, she's a Republican. So if the Republicans were in charge, she would have been the prime sponsor and I would have co-led with. It was the governor and the resident commissioner who wrote the bill because it should be reflective of the island's elected representatives voices. I've never had a problem with the island being independent. The problem becomes if there's more support for independence on the mainland than there is on the island. And it's pretty passionate support, particularly it's about 50-50 in New York and a little more statehood in Pennsylvania and New Jersey haven't seen us strong up polling so I couldn't tell you. But I think we who live in states shouldn't be telling folks on the island may need to be independent. It polls in single digits down there. And the reason is they prize their American citizenship. I mean we're passing the Drian promise act and the Farm Worker Modernization Act to get more people in American citizenship. The vast majority of Puerto Ricans are believed in self-subian American citizens and prize that. They also receive billions in federal funding that boosts their quality of life compared to other Caribbean nations. All of them are doing their best but they don't get $42 billion after a hurricane. When Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas, they got a few hundred million dollars. Puerto Rico got $42 billion. They get all sorts of help because they're part of the United States. With this election we're going to be pushing pretty strong for statehood support. We have support from LBOC in New Jersey as a member from Newark that many of you may know, my Armado Cabado and from Richie Torres from our first Afro Latino Puerto Rican in the Congress is also a member of the LGBT community. But there's some debate over this. My problem is I think the times come. We've debated for 120 years. We don't need more debates. We need action. And if the folks down there wanted independence that support them but the vast majority of folks, they want statehood. So we're going to fight for that. That's one of those historic battles. Ironically I'm one of those Puerto Ricans who doesn't like to argue. I just like to solve problems. I like to end arguments. Not continue to debate and debate over and over and over again. And this needs a resolution because there's 3.2 million people in the island living in a failed state as second class citizens in the United States of America. They've asked for statehood and we're going to support them. Thank you Congressman. I want to build on that question of representation and you alluded to it earlier. One of the questions from Antonio, a surcer asks, we need more Hispanics elected but I think we also need Latinos, Hispanics in government positions, probably appointed positions. So maybe if you could reflect on how we make that happen. Either encouraging successful candidates. Talk to us about encouraging representation in Congress or state legislatures also. First, I'm really proud of the fact that the youngest woman ever to be elected to Congress is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow Puerto Rican. She is the vast exception to the rule. She got right into Congress. Most of you that will not happen. You want to start in city council or in school board or in the state legislator. We don't want to do the lottery ticket runs. He's a generational candidate. You and I probably are not. So start at the local level or at the state level. Get involved in campaigns first and foremost before. I was knocking on doors as a canvassier that I managed campaigns before I ran my first successful campaign for office. So I think you have to get involved and pick what part of you want to be a part of. Then get involved in one or two campaign cycles. But I also give you valuable information on one. How to knock indoors and talk to voters. Two about the issues. Three had a debate and deal with the press. Four had a fundraise and have a sense of how to manage a campaign. So all those things are the fundamentals. And start at a level that you don't need a million dollars to win. And so we build the bench for a point of positions. You know, that's all about winning an executive grant position and for our community as Hispanics to pick the winner and fight for them to win. You have Governor Murphy who I know has a diverse administration, but take President Biden, for example, put a Reacons. We Florida put a Reacons to being the most powerful put a Reacons on earth. We helped elect Barack Obama twice in Florida. But now it's the Pennsylvania put a Reacons in the Philadelphia suburban area that are the most powerful ones in the country. They helped elect Barack Obama. And what did we see under our excuse me? They helped elect Joe Biden. What did we see under Barack Obama? The first Supreme Court Justice who was a put a Reacons first Latina in Justice Sotomayor who I've found out the put a Reacons legal defense fund with my great uncle, Lorenzo Castanova in New York back in the day. And it is our wise Latina in the Supreme Court. Just recently talking about education, we have Secretary Cordona, the first put a Reacons in a cabinet position in the history of our nation. Huge. We've had some surge in generals, but we never had, but that's not a confirmed cabinet position. He's in the cabinet. We have my good friend, Basetta, a Mexican American who was a long time member of Congress and from California who is a then attorney general. He is slated to be our HHS secretary and a dear friend of mine. He's been in Florida many times. But it took back in the right horse to get a point of positions. It's high stakes when Trump won, when President Trump won, a generation of Clinton youth went home. They didn't have jobs in DC. They didn't get a point. They didn't have all these amazing things. They were out. And it was the Trump youth. Many of them actually from the Northeast, from many schools in the Northeast that got those opportunities. And now they went home and Biden got elected. Now you see a whole different group of folks, young people get appointed. It's high stakes. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. And when you do, you go into different think tanks or different nonprofits to help form the policy like Center for American Progress as a classic example, where people will go there and a lot of the folks who were there now, some of the nominees, for some of these positions, or they work in the Congress, or they work in their local state government. And it takes also, it's helpful to come from a state like New Jersey if you have a Democrat in power because we have a unified Republican government in Florida. The chances of you being a Hispanic who's in the cabinet in Florida is much more difficult. And without being a cabinet person on the state level, that puts you in a better position than being like an environmental director for a city or for a county. Because you've done a much larger level. You see Mr. Reagan, African American who was the North Carolina Environmental Protection Secretary, now, ep, slated to be EPA Secretary. So the states can be a big training grant also to get to that federal level, which is so difficult. We're talking about 340 million people. It's a very narrow chance, but someone's got to get those positions. And so I'm running on campaigns, waiting in exact positions, starting out through campaigns, then starting out through local government or state government and getting into federal government. That's the path for most folks. But you never know. We saw before with my, with my, my, my, my, Alexandria that it can happen. It's just rarely. That's why it's so celebrated when it does. And I see we're probably time for another one or two questions and this, this notion of staying engaged, whether it's people running for office or serving in government, but even voters. Certainly a lot of our work at the Center for Youth Political Participation is registering and mobilizing Rutgers students. But can you talk a bit? I see a question from Lola, the best way to engage voters and keep voters engaged, looking ahead to future elections. We know in this most recent election, we had very strong voter turnout. How did any recommendations policy you recommend for really maintaining and enhancing voter participation? It's a multi tiered effort. So there's knocking on doors and town halls. And I host a town hall each month on various topics. And then I do round tables with, with, uh, support of coalitions like unions or environmentalists, veterans or my Hispanic, uh, round table or my LGBTQ round table or, um, my justice round table. So I'm listening through round tables, multiple of them a month at a town hall each month. We're knocking on doors to certain elections. So okay. So I'm just a part of it to get all the ideas of the needs as well as what you read in the newspaper and what you see, um, I focus more on our, our, our, our local newspapers and our local stations because it's central floor. It is a very, people are concerned about what's happening in that area, um, to a large extent. Then from there, you have to put forward a platform that helps solve these issues. And you're, and it's a constant turnover. You solve this, but this comes up and you're doing this over time. Then you have to keep people through constant contact, informed on what you're doing to help accomplish it or why it didn't work out, but that you committed best efforts. So how do we do that? Twitter, Facebook, in addition to the town halls and, uh, an email newsletter every week. So for Twitter and Instagram, we're talking about our, our younger folks, 18 to 20 something, maybe even 30 something and then Facebook is more for your late 30s to 50s or 60s. And then emails for, uh, most of the seniors in the district look, seniors vote more than any other demographic. So even as a young person, half your vote could be 50 plus. So if you're a 28 year old running for office, remember half the people who you're looking to get their votes, the most likely voters are almost W. H. But you could still do it. I know. But you need to have that multi tier, not everybody's going to, and then you have to do it over and over again. When you put out one tweet that said, Hey, we passed the Venezuela TPS. Happy day. That's not enough. It's got to be over and over and over over the course of months. We're going to pass the Samaritan Rescue Act. I will have multiple events in the district, probably three to four dozen by the time it's over with. In addition to another 30 to 50 posts on it, another 30 to 50 tweets on it over months. Because people need to see once we passed it, there's so much at once that it takes time to explain all these things. People need to see that you're improving their lives, that you're delivering. And so it's through that multi tiered ability, some of which is direct contact. In this case, a lot via zoom, although we've had some hybrid town halls, half in person, half in zoom already. Florida, the rules are a little different than a majority, but that's a whole another story. But it's that direct contact, social media, listening towards having your advisory committees, the local press is a huge part of the two. In central Florida, we're the 22nd largest media market. So I get covered pretty much almost every day in my local press on TV. All I hear from constituents is you're on TV every day. I don't focus on the cable news like MSNBC or CNN or Fox News because they tend to go to the extremes. In my district really, there's not nearly as many people as watching as the local WSH2 or WKMG or news 13 or others. So that's another way. In New York, in New Jersey, it's tougher because you're the largest metro area in the nation, 30 million people. The news is what they say it is in Manhattan and on the major stations. I remember being up there and it's hard to get local news. Although you're starting to get R equivalent in news 13, some of these other more localized ones that are helpful through spectrum is one of those. But that's a complaint of folks from LA and New York and Chicago and other areas that they have to go on the cable stations because they have to lay themselves in fire to get news locally. So that's another way, very important for folks who are 40-ish plus to 30-ish plus who are watching the local news. And you have to do that over and over. Repeat it, repeat it, repeat it because every time you're doing it, you're getting that much more saturation in your community. And it's a lot of hard work. I'd end this question by saying, look at what FDR did. He was excellent at that. With the fireside chats, with keeping it simple with a new deal and explaining how it related to everybody. He was very good at explaining what was happening. I can say, while President Obama was one of the best speakers we've had in a generation, there wasn't as much time spent explaining the Affordable Care Act or explaining the American Investment Act as there should have been. And there wasn't enough taking a credit, which is why he got clovered in the midterms. Biden is much more of a traditional liberal candidate in the president and the realm of FDR. And you're going to see him talk over and over and over and over and over about the American Rescue Act. And he's going to go around the country saying, we got you that farm relief. We got you that new highway. We got you that vaccine center. And that's really important to do because this is taxpayer money. We have to show what we're delivering and make that connection. Otherwise people think this money is being spent and it doesn't help the mental home. So that's really important. It takes discipline. So as we're wrapping up, it seems we go back to that importance of connection and relationships and communications. So sadly, our time is wrapping up. And I want to stop and first thank you, Congressman Soto, for taking time out of your very busy day to join, to come back to Rutgers, even if it is via Zoom, but to come back to your Rutgers community. Certainly want to thank the Louis family for yet another wonderful program. Thank you to all of our co-sponsors, including the Rutgers Center for Social Justice Education and LGBT communities. Rutgers Center for Latino Arts and Culture. Rutgers University Alumni Association and the Hispanic Bar Association of New Jersey. Certainly want to thank you, Congressman Soto. I feel compelled. I'm director of the Center for Youth Political Participation. And if you've been inspired by Congressman Soto today, this afternoon, our center is holding an event called Are You Running to provide sort of nuts and bolts advice to Rutgers students but students around the country who think they might want to run for office one day. So we want to thank you, Congressman Soto, for joining us. I don't know if there's one last thing you'd like to say as we're wrapping up. As young people, the future of our country really most directly affects you. So get involved, get informed and stay involved for a lifetime. You are how we're going to address some of the biggest issues facing our nation from climate change to addressing COVID-19, addressing systemic racism and justice issues to having equality, to having an economy that works for all of us. All these things, if you're wondering who the solution is, it's you and your involvement. So thank you to you, Dr. Matto and thank you to Rutgers University for this opportunity to be able to address you all today. Thank you. That's a perfect way to end the day and thank you all for joining us and have an excellent day. Thank you.",

First, Republicans try to take away our freedom to vote on January 6th. Democrats fall back and protect it our democracy. Now Republicans are here to try to take away women's freedom to choose. And today we Democrats fight back. Next Republicans will go after the freedom for LGBTQ marriage equality. And then Republicans will even try to take away the right to birth control medicine. We are here to say enough is enough. We Democrats are here to protect and defend these freedoms for every American and stop radical Republicans from rolling back the clock. In the Dobbs case, the US Supreme Court, this would be the first time ever that a Supreme Court took away a fundamental right, a federal reproductive right granted to women that stood for nearly 50 years. To know that is to know how truly unprecedented this ruling was and how truly radical the decision was. For Republicans is about power and control. By having the power to force women to remain pregnant, or ed states will gain more control over them. Once the state controls the woman's body, they control their ability to work. Their ability to decide how big a family they want to have. They control their health care decisions. In short, they control their destinies. And then red states will go after birth control next. Women can never stop having children. And then they'll try to restrict their travel out of states and will be stuck. Now consider that many of these red states are the poorest in the nation and have the highest child poverty. In essence, we'll have red states that will force women to have children and do nothing to help take care of them. What's the ultimate effect in some states women will still be free in America. But in others, they will be second class citizens and wards of the state by design. And life there will start looking a lot more like a real-world handmaid's tale for women. And coming from Florida, this will be especially true in the South. We're already seeing women from Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas coming to our state to exercise the reproductive rights. In Florida, we have a right to privacy and shrine in our Constitution. The state constitution clearly says every natural person has the right to be let alone and free from government intrusion into a person's private life. That kind of radical government intrusion into a woman's personal health, this is, is that 20 states have either already made or are about to. In 1989, the Florida Supreme Court held that the right to privacy protected a woman's right to choose. As a lawyer, given the plain language of this amendment, I can state that it would be legally absurd for any Florida Supreme Court justice, let alone a court of self-proclaimed, strict constructionist to take away this right now in our state. The Florida Constitution is clear. So is the will of Floridians. Nearly 80% of Floridians support a woman's right to choose and oppose an abortion ban. We are the majority. Yet Governor DeSantis and their public and Florida legislature have already tried to infringe on this right with a 15-week ban. DeSantis likes to say he's protecting the free state of Florida. Laws like this show, it is a lie. The new law has already been struck down by the trial court and will soon make its way to the Florida Supreme Court and the fate of 11 million Florida women and their freedom hang in the balance. So does the freedom of women in neighboring states throughout the South. Meanwhile, House Democrats have already passed Women's Health Protection Act to codify, row, and to create a national right to abortion under federal law. Now the Senate must take up this bill without delay. We Democrats will continue to fight to ensure women across Florida and the rest of the nation are still truly free. Dr. Furma, to close that, we...",

        "transcript": " 8 years ago, our community came together. Right here in Ossiola County, this Sunday before the election in 2008, and we heard from the man from a place called Hope. At that time, eight years ago, our country was grappling with an economic freefall as thousands of our families here in Central Florida lost their jobs and their homes as we face the great recession. And in that moment, our community here in Ossiola came together and spoke with one voice and one heart. And we elected our president Barack Obama. In these last eight years, our economy has recovered as we have begun to prosper once again, as we evolve our manufacturing, high tech and small businesses across this country. But so much more happened along this journey. In 2008, I was running for my first reelection for the Florida House. And I love you, Carlos. And in 2008, and this election day, with your help, I will make history as the first Puerto Rican from Florida elected to the United States Congress. We also saw the nomination of one of our own, Aborita, Latina, nominated to the highest court in the land. Our United States Supreme Court Justice Sonia Soto Mayor. We also saw the DACA and DACA programs established so that our dreamers, children brought here on this country through no fault of their own, could take part in the American dream. If you want to thank our president Barack Obama and fight for our dreamers, let me hear you. We saw the Landlord the Florida Care Act providing more than two million more Floridians with health care. Many of them right here in Central Florida. If you want to thank our president Barack Obama, let me hear you. We want to protect our everbites, our springs right here at home. And we finally embarked down the road to fight global warming. If you believe in science, let me hear you. And with our president and Supreme Court, leading the way, we have become more perfect and more equally union by allowing all Americans to marry those who they love. If you believe in equality, let me hear you. And now we are at Crossroads once again. The time has come to pass the torture progress through our Debate on the Credit nominee Hillary Brottom Clinton. We need to get the opportunity to continue down the path of economic prosperity, increase the minimum ways here in Central Florida and help our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico as well. You believe we still need to move forward? Let me hear you. We also need help for our young people, for our students, to reduce, to wishes, and attack the rising of the food flow today. Let me hear you. We also need to come together in the government that works to improve our nation's infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, and our ports. If you believe the greatest country in the world should have a world class infrastructure and a world class quality of life, let me hear you. We also need to build upon the progress of Obamacare to create greater access to high quality health care. If you believe health care is the right and the greatest nation in the world, let me hear you. We also need to continue to protect equality for all Americans, regardless of race, religions, sex, sexual orientations. If you believe equality is the way of life here in America, let me hear you. We also need to continue the path that our life plan for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. It's time for our different families to be able to come out of the shadows to be able to participate in the American Dream and join all of us. You think we need a break for immigrants? Let me hear you everyone. We also face a great challenge to make sure to protect social security and Medicare for seniors who fought to build this country into the greatest nation in the world and to make sure that it will be available for future generations. If you stand with our seniors, let me hear you. We must also avoid possibly unnecessary wars and take care of our servicemen and women on the battlefield to make sure they know that they fought for freedom and we care about them. We need to ensure that our veterans are welcome home with open arms and have the resources they need to continue as productive members of society. If you care about our veterans, if you believe freedom isn't free, you're going to stand by and completely hear you. I trust the mom of First Lady, a United States senator, a Secretary of State, and the most experienced woman for the job of President to get it done. If you support Hillary, not only did you let me hear some noise. Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary. She is going to need every single one of you because she cannot do it alone. Our community must rise once again and speak with one heart and one voice and you are going to let her to the White House. Because the kid I go back, we stand here and say we will not be invited, we will not be invited by last June and we will know who we want to love. If you agree, let me hear you. Because here in Central Florida and throughout our country, our diversity is our biggest strength. For we are all equal members of one great family and American family and we are stronger to protect the progress we have made and power our families, our community, our nation, to continue to strive for a bright future for all of us. So please don't forget, today is the last day of early voting here in Oceola County. If you vote here, raise your hand. If you haven't, now is the time and who is going to vote here until Election Day. Raise your hand. Fight until the last day, until the last hour and on Election Day. We here in Central Florida will change the world once again and have the first moment in the White House. And you too. We are all equal. We are all equal. Let's thank you for your good.",

        "transcript": " members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the president. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 4, 2021, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Soto, is recognized for 60 minutes as the design of the majority leader. Madam Speaker, you're in luck. I heard a lot of complaints. No solutions. That's why my colleagues across the aisle lost the 2020 election miserably. We know what they're against. President Biden said it best. What are the Republicans for? What are they for? Some of them joined us and some of the bills I'm about to outline. But the rest of them, it's been nothing. Meanwhile, Democrats deliver. The American Rescue Plan, shots and arms, money and pockets. We stopped another great recession. Can you imagine how we'd be able to respond to Delta or Omicron without passing future relief? Now unemployment's below 4%. We created over six nearly seven million jobs last year. In my district, we were devastated by the Great Recession for closures devastated Central Florida. This time around in 2021, for closures that are down from 2020. Workers in Central Florida lost their homes. Last time around, this time around we put a stop to it. House Republicans voted no. Yet Republican governors took the American Rescue Plan money and responded to our nation's crisis. That's what we should all be doing. Next we go to the bipartisan infrastructure framework. There's huge support among all Americans to upgrade America, our roads and bridges, our ports and airports, our clean water, clean and resilient energy, rural broadband. I have both urban suburban and rural areas of the district and everyone regardless of their party background in my district is excited about this infrastructure. We have had meetings with local officials across the area and they're looking to work with us to upgrade America. According to Republican Senator Rob Portman, it helps fix supply chains in his counterinflationary. That's why 22 senators from their Republican side voted yes and 10 Republican colleagues here in the House voted yes. We applaud these 32 Republicans for joining all Democrats and voting for the infrastructure bill. What did the radical House Republicans do? They attacked their own over infrastructure. What a sad, sad legacy that is. It didn't stop a few of them from trying to take credit though. Trying to take credit for projects despite voting no. But if you vote no and you try to take credit now, the message is clear. America will shame you every day, every time. And now we turn to the Compete Act. Madam Speaker, 32 Republicans join with Democrats to vote for the Senate's version of this. Testing domestic microchip manufacturing, which we do in our district and I'm going to go a little more into that in a moment. Improving supply chain for medical supplies like PPE, like vaccines, telecom, solar, all these critical issues. And yes, making us be able to compete against economic rivals like China, like Russia and others who don't share our values. So in the Senate, they're able to come together, the vast majority of them. And in the House, I hope we are. I hope we have a few of our colleagues. But then there's going to be a conference, right? We're going to conference this, make some deals between the House and the Senate, and we're going to get something together. And that bill is going to come back. That's going to be the last shot. The last shot for both Democrats and Republicans to come together to ensure we could produce millions of new jobs in domestic manufacturing. I want to commend the America Compete Act, Madam Speaker, for including $52 billion to incentivize private sector investments and continue to American leadership in semiconductor manufacturing. Microchip manufacturing to help address supply chain disruptions and ensure more microchips are produced here at home. I've heard from my local auto dealers, I've heard from local manufacturers. We need to make these microchips at home. And this bill helps us do that. Within our district in central Florida, we have the Neocity Technological Campus, which is recognized as an emerging microchips, microelectronics, and advanced manufacturing hub. We've already had made synergies with institutions of higher education across Florida and key partnerships with the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Commerce under both the Trump administration and now under the Biden administration. Neocity is home to bridge a non-for-profit public-private partnership, specializing in domestic semiconductor research, development and manufacturing. I'm Nick, a world-renowned international research and development organization active in the semiconductor design and architecture space, also has a presence there. SUS microtech, a leading supplier of equipment and process solutions for the semiconductor industry, they're working at Neocity and Skywater Technology, the only U.S. owned and operated pure play trusted foundry that works on leading edge advanced packaging technology for microchips and microelectronics. They're all working out in collaboration at the center of Neovation at Neocity, one of the most state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing facilities in Western Hemisphere. As envisioned by this important legislation, the facility and experts at Bridge, I'm Nick, SUS microtech and Skywater Technology offer immediate capability to accelerate U.S. production of critical semiconductor chips, strengthen the domestic supply chain so chips are made right here in America and turbocharged our research capacity. Equally as important, Neocity Academy, a public STEM magnet high school is training the leaders of tomorrow's science and technology workforce. I am proud of the work being undertaken in our district to support domestic semiconductor manufacturing technology development as they work to address the supply chain. I look forward to working with the administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce on implementation of the American Compete Act and the Chip for America Fund. In this bill, we were able to get an amendment to clarify that chip's funding also includes nonprofits like places like Neocity and we appreciate the House for supporting this, adding nonprofits to the definition of covered entities to expand the semiconductor and center program to include nonprofit entities, clarifying that nonprofit entities like 501C3 facilities like Neocity are also eligible for funding under the semiconductor and center program. Before helping with aerospace there, we are starting to work with commercial space like NASA and SpaceX and Blue Origin. The bill also includes my second amendment. We know that we are boosting forward Madam Speaker on artificial intelligence. We need to make sure as we are doing that and seeing more autonomous vehicles and other artificial intelligence uses that we are training our labor force ahead of time for the jobs of today and tomorrow. That's why I'm proud that the AI Jobs Act passed as an amendment and directs the Department of Labor to create a report analyzing the future of artificial intelligence and its impacts on the American workforce. Specifically, the report would collect data to analyze which industries are protected to have the most growth through artificial intelligence and the demographics which may experience expanded career opportunities through and those most vulnerable to job displacement. This is an inclusion of our standalone bill, HR6553, the AI Jobs Act. Thirdly, we were able to include an amendment for the blockchain and crypto currency specialist within the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is required to establish a blockchain and cryptocurrencies advisory specialist position within the office to advise the President on matters related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. OSTP advises the President and others within the executive office of the President of the Scientific, Engineering and Technological aspects of the economy, national security, Homeland Security, Health, Farm Relations and the Environment. It is critical to create such a position within OSTP to ensure there is a policy expert capable of advising the President and others within the executive office on these issues of growing national importance. But wait, there is more Madam Speaker because we got our Restoring Resilient Reefs Act which passed through our Natural Resources Committee to reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act, the CRCA, which expired nearly 15 years ago. It maintains the NOAA Coral Reef Program which also while also introducing overdo improvements to coral management and restoration efforts and giving innovative new tools to partners who are closest to this crisis, states, territories, tribes, communities and universities. We know that the Great Florida Reef is in danger and we are doing everything we can to restore it. It is critical to our recreation, to clean water, to protect habitat and to tourism. A few of the provisions included in the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act, a bipartisan bill that passed out unanimously out of the Natural Resources Committee, include a five-year authorization with the explicit focus on restoration activities where natural disasters and human activities have degraded reef ecosystems. This program is currently funded at $33 million for 2021 but without further direction from Congress. Creates a block grant program where states and territories can receive federal matching funds. For the prior years, coral expenditures provided they have an action plan in place, which will incentivize increased state and local investment in coral reef management capacity. We are also helping inter-governmental partnerships for key, that are key for water infrastructure upgrades, pollution mitigation efforts and re-growing reefs. It allows for the formation of the public-private partnerships for coral management called coral, stewardship partnerships. Public-private partnerships are critical for sharing research. It also authorizes the U.S. coral reef task force to ensure states, territories and other stakeholders, continue to have a voice in U.S. coral reef management. Public feedback is essential. Establishes a single stream line set of guidelines for action plans to implement the national strategy with maximum flexibility given to state and local authorities. These action plans will focus restoration efforts more effectively. They also allow for emergency grants and emergency funds for coral disasters. This is critical for hurricane-prone areas like Florida, and will assist with hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, as well as oil spills and other major pollution events. We thank all House members who supported this for its inclusion in these, along with these technological amendments, these coral reef provisions in this essential piece of legislation that allows us to compete in the 21st century. It's in the name, Madame Speaker, and together we're going to get this done. In honor of Black History Month, I would like to recognize Dr. Fay Bellamy. Dr. Fay Bellamy is a retired educator.

Hailing from the great city of Quincy, Florida, Marisa Jefferson-Lias is the daughter of Wilbur Senior and Jeannie Jefferson. Her father's successful fruit contracting business brought the family to Pope County, Florida, where Marisa embarked on an amazing journey of academic excellence. After graduating from Effingham County, High School in Savannah, Georgia, Marisa returned to Florida and enrolled in Pope Community College, now Pope State College. She received an associate degree in Liberal Arts. She then matriculated to the Almighty Bethune Cookman College, now Bethune Cookman University, receiving a bachelor's degree in education. And the phrase can't stop, won't stop, was a person, then Marisa who would be the title holder of that mantra. She continued her studies at the University of South Florida, receiving a master of education in organizational leadership. Marisa took her educational talents to the Pope County School Board, where she spent 16 years as a certified educator, holding various positions such as elementary teacher, reading coach, medical academy director, and health science clinical nurse and instructor. Marisa's gift of being an educator and a nurturer allowed her to receive her bachelor's degree in nursing from Pope State College. She went to Florida Southern College and obtained her master's degree in nursing, specializing as a family nurse practitioner. She is currently matriculating her doctorate in the same college with a projected completion date of 2023.

Not only has Marisa, but has received everything that she has set her mind to possess, but she is also the epitome of a leader, advocate, nurturer, and mentor. Her compassion for people and helping others stems from a generational line of educators and nurses, including a great grandmother who was a nurse midwife. The same dedication, Marisa carries as a nurse and community leader allowed her to recognize the need for more nurses and nursing assistants. She started a company that offers training and prep courses for nurses during the pandemic, since that void needs to be filled in her community. She currently is the owner of Divine Essential Medical Academy LLC, as well as other business ventures. She is a blessed wife and mother and godmother.

This is about the fight for everything and every one when I say everything say every one everything everything Everything It is so damn good to see this crowd Yeah, we all know that we're living in some dark times we see the foundations of our society Social security Medicare Medicaid the very safety nets that people have fought for for generations to ensure that our country lives up to his promise Are being targeted by the billionaires and the oligarchs and the corporations This insidious rise of authoritarianism is fueled by corrupt billionaires and mega corporations who believe that they have the right to control every aspect of our lives our Healthcare to our schools to our thoughts to our very speech Under the false banner of patriotism and freedom and a false banner of patriotism They would have us believe that if we gave them all the control everything would be great but breaking news They've had the control and look at where we're at right now Massive wealth inequality in this country where most of our people have paycheck to paycheck And it is in a new problem for generations the billionaires and oligarchs have kept all this wealth and left us with the crumbs But we say no more In this moment we all have a choice to make as Elected officials we can't live in the world of what we can't do But we have to live in the world of what we can and must do I'll tell you I Had some friends come up to me and say Maxwell you should think about running for Congress four years ago. I said hell know you're crazy The crazy thing is I didn't have all the power at the time. I didn't have all the money I experienced homelessness during my campaign and as many of you know even after I was elected I couldn't find a place to live in DC because the housing costs were too high But the crazier thing is we won We didn't have all the power When we woke up and saw it was a Twitter at this time When we woke up and saw on Twitter that a black man George Floyd had been lynched in broad daylight We didn't have all the power, but we still took to the streets to say that black lives matter They didn't have all the power When a gunman walked into Marjorie Stoeman Douglas in Parkland, Florida And murdered 17 students children and teachers But the students rose up Demanded that we end gun violence and the world didn't just watch the world marched to end gun violence I say this Because a lot of times when you don't have all the power that you want you use all the power that you got and that's what we have to do in this moment We We need to use everything in our toolbox We can't afford to brush aside any part of our movement. We need mutual aid We need protest. We need direct action. We need a legislative strategy We need to be in the courts litigating because I promise you our opposition are not leaving any tools in their toolbox They're using everything they have And it's insane because there is such international solidarity in the right wing fascist movement January 6th here January 8th in Brazil Funded by a lot of the same people and organized by a lot of the same people But here's the thing Their movement is run by fear Trying to push us against one another They would have our people believe that the reasons we can't afford rent the reason we can't afford health care The reason we can't afford groceries is because of other people in our own communities Yes, we know that this system is rigged and the status quo doesn't work for Americans But it's not rigged against the billionaires. It's rigged for the billionaires and for the corporations They are the ones hoarding so much wealth we can't even imagine what it is They're the ones cutting essential programs that help working families while giving themselves massive tax breaks that benefits nobody but themselves They tell us that immigrants are stealing our jobs But they're the ones shipping jobs overseas and hiring corporate lawyers to go in union bust They're the ones that are screwing us over on the jobs They tell us that trans people are a threat to our children But they're the ones dismantling public education They're the ones denying the climate crisis They're the ones poisoning our planet They're the ones doing nothing about the national public health emergency of gun violence And they want us to believe that they're the patriots of free speech But they're the ones kidnapping and disappearing college students across this country that are just fighting for peace to ensure that innocent people don't die The message is simple and I've done so I've been traveling the country I went to Michigan with my good friend senator Chris Murphy to a Republican district And the message is simple We're in this situation not because of our neighbors I promise you your bank account looks a lot more like your trans neighbors or your immigrant neighbors and nothing like Elon Musk's In fact, we're all closer to being on the streets than having a bank account that looks like his How do you think he got to where he's at? I have people who come up to him and say Maxwell why would they be stealing Elon Musk is already the richest person in the world He has enough money The question is how do you think he became the richest person in the world And you know Elon doesn't like me If you told me five years ago that the richest man on earth would be tweeting about me I mean it goes to show Elon's a great example that money can't buy you happiness And money can't buy you a Wisconsin supreme court seat either But I'll tell you our way out of this is not to back down is not to be silent is not to be divided Throughout human history authoritarians they're never satisfied with the power that they have And so they test the bounds they push the limits they break the law and then they look at the public to see if they're quiet or if they're loud If we are quiet if elected officials are quiet then we are complicit and we cannot be complicit in the tearing apart of Medicaid of Social Security of food stamps a nutritional assistance of the things that we fought for and earned This is why This is why Democrats in the house and across the country we can't be and we are not the minority party We must be the opposition in this moment And then in less than two years we will become the majority And I'll tell you this Elon Musk was on the news the other day saying well the Democrats win. It's just going to be subpoenas and investigations It's the one thing he's right about your damn right. There's going to be subpoenas Your damn right. There's going to be investigations because when you steal from the people Expect the people to rise up at the ballot box and on the streets Look I'll end with this I'm not going to be the one to sit here and say everything is going to be okay Because to be honest there's going to be a lot of people and there's already a lot of people who are not okay Who are suffering from this authoritarian right wing regime that is trying to have a billionaire take over of our government But the good thing is we are not alone Not just in this moment and in this crowd, but I mean we're not alone in the grand mosaic of humanity and timeline of Justice we stand alongside the water protectors the freedom fighters the anti-war warriors the labor organizers and movements of working people throughout human history That I've seen the world through the eyes of the most vulnerable and said we are all together. We are not divided and we are not apart And it's not going to be easy and I know this coming from a movement I got involved in politics when I was 15 years old because I didn't want to get shot in school I was a part of movement for 10 years and still part of the gun violence prevention movement That the time when the most people give a damn about our issue Is coupled when there's the most death and chaos A movement When the country is paying attention to us. This is what's going on right now I always tell people the testament of an organizer is what you do when nobody's paying attention But the testament of a movement is what you do when the world is watching and the world is watching our country right now There will be times when we feel discouraged There will be times where we feel disappointed But when those feelings overcome you think about this moment think about you are people think about our stories And think about the people who came before us and in my mind I always think about the amazing Angela Davis when she said I am no longer accepting what I cannot change I am changing what I cannot accept So to the people can you accept cuts to social security Can you accept cuts to Medicare a Medicaid Can we accept the rise of right wing authoritarians in this country Can we accept them banning the books in our libraries Can we accept them trying to ethically cleanse our people from a land Can we accept kids being mowed down in their schools Well, it sounds like we have a lot of damn work to do god bless you all Let's continue to fight and we will win. Thank you",

He says that he became a warden eyes when he was 15 I see we have a lot of young people around here And I just want to know raise your hand if you start a organizing for a better world before you turn 18 years old The reason I bring this up is for a simple fact I started organizing at 15 because I didn't want to get shot in my school And the fact of the matter is there are so many people in this world so many families of a lost loved ones like man Who don't get that privilege And the fact the matter is we lose a hundred people in the gun violence The housing housing prices is out of control and people are yearning for bold champions who believe in the bold Transformational change that we need that every single person in central Florida across this whole state and across this nation Deserved by virtue of being a human You know I've had a lot of ups and downs over the past 10 years I know a lot of times it can feel like things are impossible or there's no Like I mean I've worked in gun violence for 10 years I thought that there's no like the other time for a while I've worked on many campaigns when I can't It lost but like there was no like the other time I remember sleeping in jail cell here in Orlando I feel like they're feeling like there was no like a The end of the tunnel because I was arrested for protest and when I look back at all those moments I always try to grab myself in the work that people have done that have come before me and someone that I always think about is a mother a mother who a long time ago in the 1950s lost her son because of racism Because of bigotry because of hate her name is making so her son emmit because he was black Was bludgeon being in and shopping ahead at 14 years old?

        "transcript": " Hello, hello everyone. Representative Frost, it's a pleasure to have you on the political stage today. Yeah, it's all over here. Most of the conversations this week are focused on the current state of the Democratic Party, but we wanted to carve out some time to focus on the future of the party and delve deeper into where young Democrats want the party to go in the years ahead. So who better to talk to than the first member of Gen Z to be elected to Congress, Representative Frost? Thank you again, but let's get started. Yeah. President Biden spoke to the delegates last night. What was the mood in the room from where you were situated? So I was sitting with the Florida delegation, the best state in the country, and the energy was very high. I mean, people were really excited to hear from the president, to hear him talk about his agenda. He's one of the most effective presidents in the history of our country and the most progressive president in the history of our country, too, which I think speaks to a lot of young Americans. I was actually specifically sitting in a row that had a lot of young Latinos in it, that are young and delegates from Central Florida and areas of South Florida as well. And they were hyping him up, you know, and they were really excited. And so there's just a lot of great energy in the room. And, you know, I'm a big Joe Biden fan, you know, from the day he called me when I first won my race. And we talked about the similarities when he was elected to the Senate. He was 29 and I was elected to the House of Representatives at 25. We spoke about his experiences going through that. To when he took my bill to make an office of gun violence prevention and used it as the framework for now the White House Office of gun violence prevention. And so I'm a big Joe Biden fan and that was a great speech. How would you sum up his legacy at this point in time? And do you think young voters care about that legacy? Or are they sort of happy to see a sort of changing of the guard? I think what we see in Joe Biden, especially in this presidency, is he's been effective, but I believe a huge reason why he's been able to be so effective is because of his experience. And, you know, who would have known that as a 29 year old senator who had the weight of few, you know, weeks to be able to be sworn in because he was so young, but one day he president of the United States and used all his relationships and experiences he learned along the way. And personal tragedy that for a lot of people you would go through that and not be able to continue that public service, but he did. And because of it, he got us out of that COVID pandemic crisis we were in, helped us bring our economy back, helped people go back to schools, go back to work, come back to real life, dedicate the most money that not just this country, but the out of the entire world has ever dedicated towards the climate crisis. And so I think Gen Z does care about his legacy. And I think, you know, history will look back on this moment and say he's one of the greatest presidents our country's ever had because of what he did during his presidency, but also because he said it last night, he loves the job, but he loves democracy in this country even more. And that's why he's passed that baton. So the past few weeks, the picture of unity across all corners of the party has been on full display. But there are divisions such as surrounding the war in Gaza. Obviously, a lot happens surrounding that. With the protests yesterday, there was some references in the speeches last night to it, but those divisions are very real. And a lot of the people who seemed most upset with the administration on subject seemed to be young voters. Or potential voters, I should say. Do you see that issue as potentially a liability for the Democrats heading into November in terms of turnout for young voters for the party? I think, you know, what the Vice President said and what she's been saying, I think is really going to help us bring together our coalition around this issue, working to achieve a ceasefire, bring the hostages home, and then continue to work to achieve a Tuesday solution. What I will say, though, is I think a lot of this has to do with the approach as well. You know, I come from the movement world, I come from organizing. I've been to your gas, Mace, I've been arrested, I went to jail in the district, and I represent for non-violent protest. So I'm never going to be one to tell people to not protest if that's what they feel like they want to do. But oftentimes, if we don't bring people in to have a conversation, it leaves a void. And oftentimes, the most extreme voices can fill that void. I remember during the Black Lives Matter uprising, I was one of the lead organizers in Orlando. And something I always told the other organizers was, like, we have a huge responsibility here to make sure we're careful in what we say, the things we chant, how we do it, because there's thousands of young people who've never done anything in politics before coming to these rallies that will repeat the things we say and look to us to understand how they can be in solidarity with Black Americans during that fight. And a similar thing is happening now, too. So I think it's important for our party to really embrace, have these conversations with people and not push them away. And Vice President Harris has changed some of her positions on issues like abortion, health care, fracking, since she started running for president. She's largely been given a pass on that by members of the Democratic Party. But how long do you think that is going to last? I mean, are these divisions going to reemerge at some point on some of these issues, which are very important, I think, to young people and particularly people on the left within the party? I think by and large, our coalition is focused on making sure Donald Trump is not elected and that we elect the Vice President. And once we get there, we'll do what our party's always on. We're a big tent party. We're a party where we're going to have a lot of disagreements on a lot of different issues. And those conversations are happening now and they'll happen once she's elected as president as well. But as you hear on stage, we have people speaking from all across the ideological spectrum on the left and as Democrats and there's even, I think, Republicans laid at the speak to during this. And I think it's showing that we believe, number one, that Kamala Harris is the person to really continue the president's agenda and build up on her own agenda to bring us forward, solve this housing crisis and gun violence, focus on defeating the climate crisis, but also bring our country together to reject Donald Trump for a second time, which he represents the rise of right wing Christian nationalism, white supremacy, and neo-fascism, something that's on full display in the state of Florida right now. Part of the reason I'm so amped up about this campaign and traveling the country to get people to vote for the VP is because the project 2025, we're experiencing that in the state of Florida right now. Forty percent of the books that were banned last year were in my state. Middle schoolers will read in their textbooks in print that black people that were enslaved receive personal benefit from it. My district attorney who got over 60 percent of the vote was taken out of office because of political differences from on the Sanctus and replaced with a political appointee, someone that he likes and he trusts. That's what's going on in my state, I don't want it to go on in the whole country. You mentioned the housing as an issue that's of interest to you. Yesterday Senator Bernie Sanders said on this stage that Congress has been negligent in not recognizing the housing crisis. Do you agree with that and you talk a little bit about your objectives in that area? Yes, he. I do agree with that. Both parties have not provided in the past a good platform on housing. I'm about to tell you what's the democratic platform on gun violence or climate. We could rattle off a list of initiatives and things housing not so much. But now that's changing. Kamala Harris, one of the first policy platforms she put forward is on housing. I think this is one of the most important issues especially for young people. During my campaign when the rent hike moratorium was lifted my rent went up by a lot. In just a month I was priced out of my apartment. I was houseless for two months. I ran out of all my money trying to figure out where to live. During that moment I was like well at least if I win I won't have to deal with this anymore. Then I get elected. I find out I need a new apartment in DC because I'm going to live up there half the year. I get denied to every apartment I applied to because my credit was so bad because I was living off my credit cards and Ubering while I was running for office. I didn't choose the housing issue. It kind of chose me. It's one of the reasons why it's one of the things I've been focused on. I have a bill called the Endjunct Fees for Renters Act which is really completely based off of my experiences as a renter and the way that our power in the marketplace has just gone down year after year after year. What this does is end junk fees, things that legally your landlord has to provide for you anyway that we're getting nickel and dived for, trash fee, lawn fee, this fee, that fee. In my district we found a few apartment complexes that charge tenants 40 to 60 dollars every time they call text or email the landlord. That's illegal in the state of Florida. We have almost no tenant protections. The other thing my bill does is eliminate credit scores as the end all be all of determining whether or not you should be able to rent or not. The study show number one credit scores are not a good indication on if someone's going to pay their rent. And number two, when a working or working poor person falls on hard times, the top thing with the last thing that they cut from is the rent. The last thing they will cut from. The first thing they'll cut from? Food and medicine. The sorts of things that you're talking about, the vice president Harris has been talking about in this area require congressional action. If Democrats don't win both chambers this fall, do you think it's still going to be possible to get some kind of deal done working with Republicans? Hopefully. And to be clear, something I've been hearing from the vice president that I love that I really haven't heard much before is she's being honest with the American people. When she's talking about these platforms, she's saying, give me a Democratic House and Senate and this is what we can do. She's also speaking about the future, been talking about what she can do without it, using the departments that she'll be directing. And so I think that's really important. I think part of the reason we have so much voter apathy in this country, 50% of this country doesn't vote is because they've been lied to, generation after generation by politicians who have told them vote for me and this will happen tomorrow. And that's not how this system works. So I understand why there's so much skepticism in this. At the same time as many Republican leaders are defunding our public education and civics are being taught less and less than our schools, this is what happens. And so we have a responsibility as elected to not be our constituents. That's something I did in my campaign. I never made campaign promises on vote for me and this will happen. I promise what I would fight for. I promise things I would do. I never promised outcomes because I know how this position works. And I want my constituents to see me done on top of them, but part of this fight just in a different place on their behalf. We also had Senator Chuck Schumer here yesterday with my colleague, Rachel Bade, who asked him twice whether he would support turn limits for Supreme Court justices. I know the Supreme Court is a subject that's a great interest to you. Senator Schumer dodged that question both times. Now, you co-sponsored Art Allicles of Impeachment for Justices, Claire's Thomas and Samuel Lido, you supported turn limits for the justice of you, said that the court is completely corrupt and that it's important that the American people see that we, the Democratic Party, I presume, don't think this is okay. What does it say to you that Senator Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader, one of the most powerful people in your party, will not publicly back this effort? Well, I think that all Democrats should be behind us. Like I said, and not just Democrats, everybody should be behind this. Here's the problem, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, it doesn't matter your ideology, when the American public starts to lose faith in our critical institutions. That's part of what shows a democracy that's taking many steps back, because you might know the United States was put on a list a couple years ago of democracies in the world that are sliding. This is part of it, people are losing faith in our institutions because of corruption. And what's the thing that pulls the highest in a bipartisan way, rooting out corruption? And so I think it's really important that we do that at the Supreme Court, and that's why I'm for these list of reforms. And open to other reforms too, we need to have this conversation now. And I'd like to see all Democrats in the Senate, in the House get behind yes, turn limits, but I'll tell you what needs to happen even before turn limits, if I were to do order for the order. I mean, I like it all at the same time, but what we really need is ethics reform. That's the first thing that needs to happen here. That's going to stop the bleeding that's happening on this court, so we can hold these folks accountable when they are not acting in the best interests of the American people. They are legislating when that's not what that court is supposed to do. If they want to do that, they should resign and run for Congress, or run for the House for Representatives, or the Senate. And we have to do our job in terms of oversight, and making sure that we maintain the integrity of that institution. I think term limits are a part of that, but I think the ethics are formalities is the biggest one. Look, there are a lot of really interesting ideas and creativity around this. And so we need to keep engaging on it as a party. But I hope it will happen in a bipartisan way more and more over the years. Well, I mean, the party has been engaged with this issue now for a couple of years. The President Biden himself traveled a bit of a journey on this subject. He was opposed to reform, and then after this most recent term, he came out for reform. The Vice President immediately came out for reform. I've spoken to your colleagues in Congress, Sheldon White House and the Senate, Representative Hank Johnson, in the House who are spearheading these efforts. But I have noticed that it can speak you as gap among the Democratic Party leadership. And I guess I wonder what is left to discuss within the party on this subject. What is it that these folks don't know that you know? I'm not sure if it's a matter of what, you know, do they not know that? Or whatever their assessment is, how do you think it is from your perspective? I'd have to talk with them and have the conversations I have with those conversations. I do know our Democratic leadership understands that some of the first things we need to do when we win the Senate have the House and the presidency is look at how we're going to strengthen our democracies. Part of the reason why, hopefully, you know, future Speaker Jeffries is going to put voting rights bills on the floor. Those will be the first things that we handle. I see that Supreme Court reformed those as a part of that as well. And so we have to have those conversations. I think that we've had enough talking. We understand the reporting has been out there. We see the corruption. We see the fact that some of these Supreme Court justices are not acting on behalf of the American people or even, of course, with a Constitution, but trying to help a specific political party in specific political candidates. I want to turn to a back device president Harris and her candidacy. You know, she's not just a woman and she's not just a person of color. She's a woman of color, right? And that introduces unique dynamics. You also have a multicultural background. How do you think Harris' biography has influenced her campaign? Her specific set of attributes? Yeah, I appreciate this question because there's something set last night. I think Rep AOC said that she's for the middle class because she's from the middle class. And I think this is in a similar way. We talk about intersectionality and all these different things. But for someone like Omelette Harris, this is her life, right? Having being mixed race, understanding different cultures. This is what our country is. I mean, me too, right? I was adopted by mom as Cuban. My dad's from Kansas. My dad's a musician. My mom's a teacher. My biological mother is Lebanese and Puerto Rican. My biological father is Haitian. So I had a lot of like, you know, identity crisis growing up. But I represent one of the most diverse districts in the country. And so when I think about the issues, I'm thinking about them through that multicultural lens. How does this impact different cultures? How does it impact different people? And it's the same thing with the vice president. And I think that enhances her ability to legislate and advocate in the right way. You know, the point of Congress is supposed to be representative of the American people. Why do we want it to be representative of the American people? Because as we're solving the problems of today and the problems of the future that we don't even know about yet, we want the most experiences represented. So we all come along for that journey. And when you have individuals who carry multiple, you know, multiple experiences in the same person, that's an asset, you know. And so that's exciting for me. And it's unfortunate that Donald Trump, JD Vance and a lot of Republican Party have, you know, really denigrated themselves in this conversation to baseless racist attacks on the vice president. Can you talk a little bit about those attacks? And how do you think the media has handled this subject? Well, I mean, I'm going to be very blunt. I first started here in Republicans, call her, you know, a DEI hire. And then it went from that to something else. It went from a DEI hire to calling her ADI, they call her ADI. To me, the way that you're saying that, the context, you know, that you're saying it, you could replace DEI with racial slurs, any racial slur. You're saying anything but the N word. That's the way I feel about it. And you have someone like Donald Trump going and talking about her mixed race identity, saying she was in it and then she turned black. Not only does this show his ignorance, but it shows his inherent racism. Because I believe that he believes that there was nothing wrong with what he said. And so I think that shows inherent flaws in who he is. How do you think the media has done in this area? You know, yeah. Intersectionality has sort of become like a loaded word in some parts of the political sort of culture, particularly on the right. And it doesn't seem like the media has done a particularly great job in this area. I agree. I mean, you know, number one, when I went on the news and talked about the fact that I saw a lot of these charges being racist, I got hammered online. And as I was looking online and hearing folks talk and puns and stuff, I didn't really hear people making that connection in a good way. There were a lot of reporters and journalists that were talking about how some of these comments made on mixed race Americans were offensive to people of many different racial backgrounds. And I think that was really important to I did a few interviews on that. But I think we need to have more of this conversation. It shouldn't be an I agree. I don't even really use the word intersectionality out in public right now, you know, because for me, this is just about who we are, like as humans, as people. Who we are, who our parents are, where we come from, what we love, what we eat, music we listen to, and how we behave. And that's just human. That's the word I like to describe with it. And so I don't like to make it hard to understand than it is. People should be validated for who they are, where they come from. That's true freedom. That's what it means to be free in this country. That's not what Donald Trump stands for. Well, I can ask you a lot more questions. This has been a short on time. It's been a very interesting and insightful conversation. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Sorry, I'm a bit short up here. Good afternoon North Carolina. I love you too. Thank you guys. First and foremost, a little bit about myself for those of you who might not know who I am. I represent the wonderful people of Pinellas County in Florida's 13th Congressional District. Thank you. I also happen to be a United States Air Force veteran. I'm his Spanic. Thank you. I am the first elected Mexican-American to Congress from the state of Florida. The reason I tell you that though is according to the left, I check all the right blocks as except for one. That is like many of you. I'm Republican, but I'm also conservative. But my story wasn't automatically into politics. In fact, I started out as a counter-tracking activist. I realized back in 2016, this really smart fellow by the name of Donald Trump was talking about something called border security and human trafficking. I agreed with him. Yet when I said stuff about it, I received rhetoric from the left saying that I was white wash because I'm half white, that I was a coconut, which is kind of ironic because I would joke back and say, well, no, I'm a vanilla wafer and they didn't like that. They can be racist, but if you joke back and make fun of them, they don't like that. Then eventually in 2018, after I decided to not pursue medical school and take the political route, I ran into someone named Kamala Harris at the airport. My thoughts exactly. You see, I ran into Kamala, of course, looking a little bit younger. Kamala Harris goes, well, do you want a selfie? And I said, no, Kamala, I don't want a selfie. I have questions. You're running for president. I want to know what you're going to do about the border. Thank you. Real quick, because the left media likes to say, women don't support president Trump and border security. How many women are here? Please make noise. When I pressed Kamala Harris on the trafficking and rape of Hispanic women and children, do you know what she did? She ran away. She ran away from the very questions that she is trying to campaign on currently as the solution to the problem that she created. She has done nothing. Nothing for the innocent children lost under her supervision. 320,000 children have gone missing under her watch as border star. Don't tell me you care about women and do not tell me you care about children because the fact is, is your dear's position as a woman minority and did nothing for us. I'm a new mom and let me tell you as a new mother, no mother, whatever elected or not accept any of that. It is simply unacceptable. So now I have a question for every single one of you because from what I'm hearing and from what I'm hearing back there, guys, we are going to win so big. They're going to try to say that we rigged it. Too big to rig is the name of the game. So from your lips to God's ears, North Carolina, I have some questions for you. Answer carefully, okay? Will Kamala Harris be our next president? That was kind of weak. I don't think they could hear you in Florida. Will Kamala Harris be our next president? That's a bit better. Will you guys be getting out to vote early? And let's chant this a few more times three times because we know Trump said fight, fight, fight. Who's going to be our next president? Again, again. That's what I like to do. We need to bring this energy to Florida. God bless every single one of you. I'm here to give you guys hope. We're going to win. We're going to take back the House. We will take back the Senate and we are taking back the White House. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " is that are not occupied. Thank you, Professor Yieldback. Thank you. Congresswoman Luna is recognized for five minutes. Can you guys hear me? OK. I just want to note that this has been a topic that has come up before with EPA. But of the endangered species, only about 3.7 of the species have ever been delisted. And the reason I bring that back is because I obviously care about animals, but it is in my firm belief that when you have certain species that are taking resources away from others that need to be listed, it doesn't really accurately serve out the purpose of what the endangered species act was supposed to do. So the legislation introduced by my colleagues right least speaks to disapprove of the fish and wildlife services rules regarding the status of lesser prey chickens and northern long-eared bats under the ESA. And by removing species from that list that have recovered and focusing resources on species that are still at risk, we can better prioritize our conservation efforts and allocate resources where they are needed the most. The Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service share the responsibility for administering the ESA. Ensuring that these agencies are properly listing and delisting species is something that's particularly important to me, especially being that I have many endangered species in my area to include the manatee and green sea turtle of which are struggling to recover accurately. My question would be for Mr. Gerton. When deciding the new rules like those of the lesser prey chicken and northern long-eared bat, what information does Fish and Wildlife Services consider? Thank you for your question, Congresswoman. So we go through a very robust, scientifically driven process to make a determination. I don't want to bore you with all the details of it, but in general terms, we're either petitioned to look at the status of species based on constituent concerns or those raised by a court, or just based on our work with our state fishing game and tribal partners, we've noticed a difference in the status and trend of how a species is doing on the landscape. And so there's a first gate that you go through, so to speak, which is called a 90-day finding, where we're either presented with information that causes us to say there's positive information here and we're going to initiate a more formal rule-making process called a 12-month finding, or we'll say that there's not adequate information here, so we'll decline looking at the status of that species. And then we go through a very robust formula, a five-factor analysis looking at threats, including disease and predation, looking at adequacy of regulatory mechanisms, looking at habitat or threatens to destruction, and we rely on science largely from the states, the tribes, our colleagues, USGS, NOAA, and others, and work that through decision matrix. A lot of it is a species status assessment, but it's scientifically driven Congresswoman. So being that the recovery rates in species are ever changing how often does the Fish and Wildlife Service review those rules for the species? So we are required every five years to do a status assessment of listed species and do a determination of where they stand, where the trend lines are showing us that their population is going. You're familiar with our work in the manatee right now, are they currently listed as a threatened species, or some advocates of access to it, but in uplifting too, in danger, we don't think that's the case now, even as we're dealing with those mortality events the last couple of winners. There's still 8,000 animals up there in that population, and they're able to withstand, and we've been very aggressive working with our partner agencies in remediation to get them through this tough patch. Just real quick, because obviously that's something that we love our manatees in Florida. Don't let that mistake you, but just out of curiosity, why are you guys not upgrading that? Because we just, I mean, we have a huge issue with red tide. I believe it's in part because of the message sewage that we get dumped into our ocean, and it contributes to the nutrients for the red tide, but our manatees are dying, and then we obviously have the boating accident, so why are they not being up listed? We look at the totality of information in Congresswoman and our scientific judgment, we believe in the case of the manatee, particularly in Florida, the status of threatened is adequate, provides almost all the safeguards that are needed, particularly given the robust partnership we have with Florida Power and Light, State Game Commission, Private Land Owners, and others. We have weeks in place with the outdoor recreation industry, all kinds of proactive measures. We're focused very much on what's going on in the Indian River Lagoon. That's where the unusual mortality event has been taking place, through a combination of rescue, rehab, supplemental feeding, and other techniques we've been able to stabilize that, and we got a lucky break this past year with winter weather on our side, but at this point, the services view is that the threatened status gives them the safeguards they need to ensure survival going forward. Okay, and then I guess my last question for you would be, so our beaches have sea turtles, and we're one of the few spots in the world for the nesting grounds for these sea turtles, and one of the issues that we have is beach re-nourishment, and so we have the Army Corps of Engineers that's not wanting to do beach re-nourishment, but obviously we have an endangered species there, so just in your opinion, do you believe that other organizations should be held accountable if they are knowingly preventing habitat protection, for example, our sea turtles? Carls, I'm not as familiar with the specifics on your case, your raise in there, but in very general terms, we work very collaboratively with the Corps of Engineers, these beach re-nourishment and replenishment projects are very complex. We'd be glad to follow up with you, or your leadership team here in DC, to get you a briefing, and talk some more about that issue, because it's gonna be a complicated one, but we're glad to follow up with you, and set up some briefings here in your district. This real quick, who loves sea turtles? Like, everyone loves them, right? So I think the Army Corps of Engineers should work with you guys, and give us our habitat for the sea turtles. Thank you, I yield my time. Thank you, Congresswoman. Excuse me, excuse me, ranking member, Fulken... Excuse me, ranking member, Fulken... Fulken...",

        "transcript": " The chair now recognizes Miss Luna. Thank you guys for being here today. The bacteria outbreak and Abbott's nutrition manufacturing facility in Michigan is, in my opinion, just one of the many examples of the FDA's lack of oversight regarding not just food standards, but I would also argue to sometimes in the pharmaceutical industries. The FDA, as I'm sure you all know, is intended to be the people's last line of defense. And although Abbott was responsible for not reporting this earlier, I do believe that there was a combination of issues that led to, unfortunately, this happening. In fact, the FDA's failure to adequately inspect Abbott and listening to whistleblowers concerned contributed greatly to the formula shortage as a whole. And it took months for the FDA to respond. Had they responded, infants could have been saved. And I'd like to note that it stated in the briefing that we got that 40% of infants infected will die if they have this bacteria, which means that of the 15 members who sit down in this committee of 40% were infected as infants, six of these members would not be here. So that's incredibly alarming. But it's clear that the FDA is not doing their job and does not prioritize food safety as well. As many of the food additives, including hazardous food dies, like red 40, yellow number five, and number six are abandoned other countries around the world because of their harmful side effects yet permissible in the United States. The FDA continued to launch an ad campaign lecturing parents about how alternative infant food formulas may lack nutrients vital to an infant's growth, yet has also at the same time approved drugs such as mythopristone for pregnant women that starves an unbored child of nutrients until they die. Or what about the 1960s debacle with FDA approving Thalidomide and actually covering up some of the investigations according to an article by The New York Times in an effort to keep this knowingly dangerous pharmaceutical on the market to the American people. So needless to say, as a member of Congress, I don't really trust the FDA. It seems though that the FDA is for sale and will work with corporations to keep harmful products on the market knowing the outcomes. We need to remove food additives that are detrimental to our health, pharmaceuticals, and improve our inspections for foods as across the board. Consumers buying food should be able to buy food and be able to trust it, not chemicals and additives that are toxic and known to carry risks. I guess my main concern because I have heard your opening statement and I appreciate your solutions to this. But why is it that Abbott is still an FDA-approved manufacturing facility for infant formula if they've knowingly covered this up? Because that's what it seems like. The facility did voluntarily shut down. Abbott has several manufacturing facilities. This occurred at the Sturgis facility. The facility did voluntarily shut down and through the consent decree, there were a series of process that they had to undergo to give us confidence that they could produce safe product and they met those requirements for the consent decree and so now they're back in operation. Has the FDA made any changes? Because I anticipate that due to COVID, you guys are not able to get into some of these facilities. But to only go to three of the, I believe it was 23 facilities, it seems like God forbid something like this happens in the future that needs to be changed. Frankly, if I was one of these parents, I would be completely ticked off at the FDA for not listening to those whistleblower complaints earlier. I think that's a fair criticism. Thank you. The FDA developed an internal policy that it would monitor COVID transmission around the country and if it was above a certain level, they would not do inspections even though they were deemed critical. If you look at other segments of the food safety profession, USDA inspectors continue to show up. They were considered critical infrastructure. If you look at many of the states, state inspectors considered to show up. So I think that's a fair conversation to have. Haven't forbid there's a future pandemic. If our FDA inspectors critical infrastructure, critical personnel and critical structure, and is there a role for them to play? But also to something outside of COVID, because it's very possible, I mean, I hate to say it, but I don't trust China and biochemicals a very real threat in this country. So obviously something outside of COVID would be important to keep you guys able to do your jobs. We also need to fully explore other means to gather intelligence, whether it's remote access of data and records. OK, thank you very much. Chairman, Chairwoman, I yield my time.",

        "transcript": " I'll join me now, Congressman Anna Paulina Luna. Congressman, I know you were there at the Capitol when it was locked down and you were with your newborn? What happened? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. I was actually coming back from a Diwali event over on the Senate side and we were told by officers as we were driving back that there was some protesting, so to get back into the Capitol, so we ultimately did. I was going to pick up my stuff and no sooner did we actually get into my office then it went basically on lockdown. We weren't able to leave. I had my young staffers with me. It was obviously not peaceful. And the irony in this Laura is that these people were supposed to be protesting for peace in Palestine, yet you see what they're doing, obviously attacking people. And frankly, rightfully so, Capitol Police did defend us. But I mean, it's crazy that this is today's day and age and that this is supposed to be acceptable. Well, Congressman, I was hearing from some of the protesters in their mouthpieces that were speaking, saying, oh, well, they didn't mean to breach the door. They weren't going to go into the building. Can you, I mean, who believes that? And they were pushing up against the police. What were they trying to do then? No one believes that. And in fact, I actually reposted because I was on Twitter and Democrat Socialists of America, DSA, mind you, we have lawmakers that are part of this organization in Congress. They actually accepted responsibility for this and basically stated that it was law enforcement that was attacking them, which you can see from the footage is an absolute lie. What we have in this country right now is a massive problem, as you had mentioned earlier with Marxist. These organizations using this movement in order to really bully elected officials into doing what they want and using violence to do so, it's what the color revolutions are and it's something that we as lawmakers have to push back on. In Congress, I don't want anyone to forget what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did. She made a big show about how horrified she was on January 6th. Massage and the racism that is so deeply rooted and animated that attack on the Capitol. There's a lot of sexualizing of that violence. And I didn't think that I was just going to be killed. I thought other things were going to happen to me as well. You thought you were going to be raped? Yeah. Yeah. Has anyone heard from her today? And her party's headquarters were under siege last night. After all, under siege. Yeah, I mean, there hasn't been any issuing of statements from anyone who is tied to Democrat Socialist of America. And what I find really disturbing about this whole thing, Laura, is that when we're sitting there talking about the fact that most members of Congress, some of which do sleep in their offices, and then you have this happening right down the street, you had a Democrat member of Congress come out and say that he was basically in fear for his safety. And then you see these organizations attacking their own party. You can see that the fracturing within the Democrat party, especially among those that are embracing anti-Semitism, is unfortunately alive and well. Now, Congress, what if it was some right wing group that was in the same way with the same body language or the same force pushing up against the police at the DNC? What do you think AOC would have done then? I mean, I think that it would be more than just AOC. I think that you would have seen the DOJ label these people as domestic terrorists and go after them. And frankly, being a member of House Oversight, I've gone to the DC prison. I've seen exactly what some of these people are facing, charges-wise. And the fact that only one person was arrested after multiple of our Capitol police were assaulted, you saw, frankly, the whole Capitol had to go on lockdown because of this behavior. And then you see an organization that's blatantly Marxist owning it, saying that they were busing people in from New York and that their quote-unquote comrads were there, basically engaging in violence. I mean, I would urge the Speaker of the House to open up a special mission exactly where this funding is coming from for these organizations that are ultimately trying to undermine not just the United States, but our constitutional republic. Yeah, well, we know that they can track transactions pretty easily on ATM machines when they want to, but they're never going to track those people. Congresswoman, great to see you.

        "transcript": " Hey everyone and thank you so much for allowing me to come speak to you today. I cannot tell you how happy I am to be here mainly because I think something that we all noticed during the 2020 election cycle is that the radical left was indeed targeting Christians and they were trying to make pastors especially quiet and afraid to use their voices to speak out to get some of their radical anti-God agenda to include pushing abortions, accepting things that don't rely with our Christian and Judeo-Christian values. And I thought, you know, for me especially running in the election cycle, not only am I going to own my values, right? I'm pro-life, I'm pro-God, I'm pro-gun and I'm anti-socialist, but I'm going to thank you. But I'm going to own the fact that I'm a Christian first and foremost. And I can tell you that my entire life, the reason why I actually decided to get involved in politics, is because I felt like probably so many of you here, definitely probably Aaron, I felt called to follow a path and to stand up for what's right in this country. Many of you may not know this, but starting out early in life, my mom actually was asked by my own father to have an abortion. And my mom told him no. And so as a result of that, for a very long time it was just me and my mom. My father struggled with a very severe drug addiction. My own grandmother actually died of AIDS due to heroin use. And by the time I actually was nine years old, I had already been involved in an armed robbery and survived it. By the time I was graduated from high school, I had attended six high schools. We did move around. One of which there was actually gang shooting on campus. And so my way out of it was joining the military, which happened to be one of the best things that I could have ever done for myself. Thank you. It's also where I later on met my amazing husband Andy, who I've now been married to for about 11 years. But how God worked in my life was very unique. And sometimes when we are all struggling through very hard times in our lives, we don't understand what the bigger picture is and how God is using us to make a change. In 2014, my husband was shot in Afghanistan. He did obviously recover, thank God. But it was because he was shot in Afghanistan that I started working alongside various veteran nonprofits to help shed light on the topic of post-traumatic stress disorder. And one of these nonprofits I came across was called Veterans for Child Rescue. And they're working with an organization called R Rescue. And they were talking about something that I had no idea was a problem with in the United States of America. That was human trafficking. They were talking about specifically child trafficking and how at the southern border there was a huge problem with it. So I decided to use my social media. Mind you, I was actually on track to go to medical school and I had a gap year. So I'm using my social media to shed light on this topic. And in around January of 2016, I actually was watching the news and I think like most Americans, I didn't think that the media would lie to push an agenda. And I was listening to CNN. But on CNN, they were covering a train that had been stopped in Mexico City. And on this train, there was women and children and there was MS-13. And that's why the train had been stopped. And they were making it political. They said we here at CNN believe that everyone deserves fair access to this country. And they actually raised money, brought these people to the American border, set their camera crews down there to film border patrol turning these people away. They weren't talking about the 18,000 women annually who are trafficked. They weren't talking about the women in children. They weren't talking about the fact that the United States is one of the top three countries in the world for human trafficking. And that is not a conspiracy theory. That's from the State Department. So I decided to use my voice. And I made a video and I said look, I'm Hispanic American. Like part of my family actually immigrated. I'm second generation. But I'm not xenophobic because I believe in border security. In fact, I'm a Christian. This is a humanitarian thing to do. And because I made that video, yes, I was met with, hey, I was called some of the worst racist names you could think of. I was made fun of because of the fact that I'm lighter skinned. They said that I was actually whitewash, that I was too white to be Hispanic. They even called me a coconut, which I have a little bit of a sense of personality. So I said I'm more like a vanilla wafer and they didn't like that. But the point is that when you are standing up for what's right, you will always be met with hate. You will always be met with controversy. You will always be smeared. And you will always be, honestly, attacked because you are standing up for what your moral conviction is, which does inherently tie to you being Christians and to your belief in God. So the day before I was supposed to go to medical school in August 18th, I actually got a phone call from Charlie Kirk at Turning Point, USA. He said, Anna, he said, you might not know me. My name is Charlie Kirk. I run this organization called Turning Point, USA. And I would like to offer you the position of a national Hispanic outreach director. We're working alongside with this woman by the name of Candace Owens. And she's handling urban engagement and we would like you to do Hispanic engagement. And so I said, all right, I had about 24 hours to decide. And the only thing that I could think of was God, why me for one. That's a huge tasking. But also, I didn't want to end up like Jonah in the whale. Seriously, I did not want to go to medical school. And then for whatever reason, be brought back here to the United States because I felt that this was now my path. I was being met at a fork in the road. And my path was, do I pursue politics to help people or do I do it through medicine? So I talked to my husband, thank you. I talked to my husband and ultimately ended up happening is I chose politics because one of my mentors told me. And he's a neurosurgeon. He said, Ana, you through legislation can impact so many people's lives more so than you probably could your entire lifetime as a physician. Thank you. And if it doesn't work out, I'll help you get into a school here in Florida. Not a bad plan, but you. So I took that opportunity and it was very quickly that I learned that the media would only let me talk about what they wanted me to talk about. But no matter what they were talking about, what the legislators were doing in Washington, DC, even if they didn't agree with them. So if I wanted to truly make change, if I wanted to truly help the issues of human trafficking, if I wanted to truly help fight back against this radical agenda that was attacking Christians, if I wanted to truly help fight against abortion, I had to go to Washington, DC to do it. So I called my husband and he is a trooper. He's actually back here right now watching me talk. Thank you, Andy. And I said, baby, we're going to be running for Congress and he goes, what do you mean we? So it's been quite the road and I can gladly say that I am running for Congress in Florida's 13th Congressional District. That there is nothing in this world that can intimidate me or bully me or make me back down from holding my Christian values first and foremost. That again, I am unapologetically pro-life, pro-god, pro-gun and anti-socialist. That I will back President Trump running for office in 2024 because he will. And that at the end of the day, you all need to use your stories because your stories can make a difference. And when given the opportunity I was talking to my husband, the choice between choosing courage or choosing fear, realize that fear is a reaction and courage is a choice to move forward, fight for what is right and help take back this country. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " after warnings to keep away from Mexico. Those warnings come to after the kidnapping and murder of US citizens by a drug cartel. Even tourists, friendly hot spots have people worry of threats of violence impacted on both sides of the border. Joining me now, Lieutenant Chris Oliverias of the Texas Department of Public Safety and Florida Congresswoman Laura Lee. LT, you know, I always say that the Texas DPS is the last line of defense of the border. You came out strong last week. You say, don't go to Mexico. Don't do it. What made you get to that decision as a department? Well, Laura, it's great to be with you. It's great to see that the message, as far as federal workers is pretty resonating with not only the American people but the freebreakers. But the whole purpose of that message, that advisory was to you want to ensure the safety and not only Texans, but everyone that traveled into Mexico because of the increased violence between the Mexican drug cartels. It's not only having to be mindful of possible targeted attacks, but also between rival cartels that are fighting each other over lucrative smugging routes as well as with the Mexican military. And that's why we put that advisory out because we want the American people. We want Texas to be safe and to avoid traveling to Mexico because of the most recent attacks that took place on those four Americans. But also Lawrence, what we're learning too as well, is not only the Mexican cartels with the violence, but also these pharmacies in Mexico that are selling pharmaceuticals that are tainted with fentanyl and other lucid drugs such as heroin and methamphetamine, which also is a significant threat to anyone who travels into Mexico and goes to these pharmacies to purchase pills such as Adderall, Danics, Percocet, whatever the case may be. So that's another message I mean, want to make very clear is to avoid going into these pharmacies in Mexico and to avoid buying any pill whatsoever unless it's prescribed by a licensed position or pharmacist. So Congresswoman, you have all the people saying, avoid Mexico, but right here in Florida, there's still the effects of the border of the fentanyl coming across that they have to deal with even here at home. That's right. And one thing that we're seeing is that today, every community in America is a border community. Our Homeland Security Committee went this past week down to the southern border to conduct a fair deal in border to conduct a field hearing. And we heard from the chief of border patrol, we heard from local sheriffs, landowners, and one thing was crystal clear, we do not have a secure border and we do not have full operational control of that border and your focus on fentanyl is so important because it is coming across that southern border into the United States and it is poisoning and killing Americans every single day. We can only get to the root of this problem if we secure that border and keep our community safe and we have got to change the Biden administration policies that are letting the cartels bring all of this dangerous substance into our country. LT, I want you to put your dad hat on because I know you love your kids more than anything in the world. When you see what's happening in spring break, what you see what's happening in our schools, you don't come at it from a law enforcement perspective. What do you do? What do we need to do to educate our kids? Well, I think it's right now, especially what you've been doing with your great reporting on the fentanyl word, but we need to continue as far as educating our kids, our friends, our founding members about the dangers of fentanyl. But most importantly, we really need to go out to these organizations that are mass-producing fentanyl. Governor Abbott declared the Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations last year at the state level. We need the federal government to step in and take action. As we speak right now, Lawrence, as much of it hurts me to even say it, we probably have someone out there right now that has lost her life because of fentanyl poisoning. Time is of the essence, that's why we need to have some action in place to actually go out through these organizations and protect the lives of the American people from these deadly poisonous taking place. Let's come across our borders. It's so true, Congresswoman. A grandmother and her grandchild were just killed across the border here at home. It's no longer a Mexico problem. So why isn't there a substance of urgency from all of Congress? Well, I'll tell you there is absolutely a sense of urgency from Republicans in Congress, who have been pointing out the incredible dangers that are posed by allowing the cartels to come across our border to engage in human trafficking, drug smuggling. We have folks from the terrorist watch list who are coming across our border into our country. So it is time is of the essence for us to take strong, swift action. To secure our border. Republicans are working hard on this. We would love to have our Democrat colleagues join us because this is not a partisan issue. This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. This is an American issue, keeping our people and our citizens safe. But I will tell you this. We are conducting these hearings. We are getting to the bottom of this information and accountability is coming. Congresswoman, LT, thanks so much for joining us. Congresswoman, LT, thanks so much for joining the program.",

        "transcript": " The Secret Service under fire for what lawmakers call a lack of planning and a communications breakdown surrounding the first assassination attempt on President Donald Trump. In its preliminary findings, the House Task Force investigation details numerous security failures in the days leading up to that July 13th rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. They say that shooting was preventable. Joining me now I have Republican Florida Congresswoman Laurel Lee, a member of the Trump assassination attempt task force. Congresswoman, welcome back to the show. As always, you and I have talked at length about the egregious oversights of that day before. This 53 page report just dropped 24 hours ago. Can any actionable change come from it? Good morning, Markey. It's great to see you. I do believe we've already seen actionable change as a consequence of these events and the investigation that we've been conducting. So the two key things that we identified related to Butler were a failure to adequately plan an advance of the event and then an inadequate amount of communication and coordination the day of. So I know the Secret Service has been working hard to make sure that they've added additional resources that they are doing more advance work with local law enforcement, really to make sure that when they're out at any event with President Trump or with Vice President Harris, that there is that cohesive use of federal and local law enforcement working together to secure these sites. Yeah. And you brought me to my next question because I was going to say two weeks out to the election day, both of these candidates still have so many rallies so you can confirm Secret Service has stepped up its game, especially for voters who want to attend these rallies. Absolutely. And that was the number one objective of this task force is, you know, of course to understand what happened and make sure that there's accountability and corrections to anything that need to be improved. But number one goal is make sure that President Trump and any other protectee are being kept safe through this home stretch. So that being said, there's a lot of work left to do to get to the bottom of how all of these failures could have coalesced. There were some reforms that need to be made to the way that Secret Service approaches, event management, its workforce. So there are a number of things in our final report that will also be reviewed and analyzed. But there has been a tremendous amount of work done thus far, both by Congress and by Secret Service to make sure that more is being done in this home stretch to prevent incidents like this from occurring. And Congresswoman, when you look in your crystal ball, if you will, I mean, what does the future of the Secret Service look like? And what's the answer to getting there? Is it more funding or what's it going to take? Well, I do think there needs to be a look at whether there are enough Secret Service agents on this protective mission. And also, how can they effectively train and prepare their partners, whether it's from Homeland Security Investigations or local law enforcement? How can those individuals also be better prepared and integrated into the Secret Service mission? I do think there will need to be really an expansion of the number of highly trained specialized Secret Service agents, whether that requires additional funding is a different question. Because there is overall a lot of funding going to the Department of Homeland Security. So it might be that we need to refine where that's being spent, how it's being spent. But I don't think there's any question that we need additional Secret Service agents on the ground to prepare to take this mission on. It's just been a, it was a scary summer of campaigning. There's no doubt about it. 30 seconds left, Congresswoman, we know the task force isn't done with the investigation. What comes next? What's the biggest question you still have top of mind? Well, we are still looking at, of course, of course, there's a second very frightening assassination attempt against President Trump and Florida. So one of the things that we are still doing is looking at that. Were there any of the same failures? Were there any of the same issues that repeated there at that second attempt? So we're still looking at that. And also the question of who these people were, where they came from, did they have any influences from other people? So those questions, we're really great, we're strong. We've got a lot of information about the logistics, what failed, what strategy didn't work. But the questions we still want to answer are the broader ones about where do these people come from and the work that we can do to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again and that we're prepared for the future threats that come. Well, we'll be eager to see all of those updates ourselves. Congresswoman Laura Lee, as always, thank you for your time right here on Morning in America. Thanks for watching, everybody.

        "transcript": " voter confidence in the elections processes and outcomes. Election administration is a core government responsibility that must be conducted in the open to build trust and understanding among voters. Election observers help to make that a reality. Election observation provides an independent perspective of the election administration process to reassure voters of its integrity or fly issues for correction. It's simple. A healthy election system includes meaningful election observer access and we commend the many state and local election officials and poll watchers across the country who worked tirelessly in 2022 to make this key election integrity process work effectively. Well, there are different types of election observers including party and campaign observers, citizen group observers, congressional observers and others. They all have a common goal of providing voters an independent perspective of the public process of election administration. Even just the presence of election observers on the ground inherently increases election integrity and voter confidence. Voters know the election administration process will be monitored and election officials know they have a direct line to the interested parties as they work to resolve any issues that might come up. Governments are present to watch the election administration process to ask questions and to build an independent record for education, certification, resolution or for other purposes but never to interfere with the process. In the case of congressional observers, they assured Congress that the person who was elected was done so as a result of free and fair election which is a key constitutional responsibility. While state law generally governs election observation, the Constitution also gives Congress a role providing for observation of congressional elections by each respective chamber. For years, both sides of the aisle and the House of Representatives have trained and deployed congressional staff to observe house elections across the country. For example, during the 2022 midterms, the Committee on House Administration Republicans offered multiple trainings and deployed dozens of congressional staff who volunteered to observe elections in many states across our country, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The independent record created by congressional observers is necessary in the event of an election contest like we saw in the House during 2021 when some house members attempted to overturn the election of Congresswoman Mary Annette Miller-Meks in Iowa's second congressional district. A political party or campaign observer plays a key role in ensuring that both sides of any issue are represented in any area where ballots are processed and counted. In fact, for decades, many states have required political parties and candidates to name observers so that this bipartisan balance is maintained and each team has its people in the room. For similar reasons, the work that citizen groups have done to recruit and train professional poll workers is critical to promoting voter confidence. In order to be effective, it is critical that all election observers not only have the appropriate training on the role and responsibilities of observers, but also meaningful access to every aspect of the election administration process that involves ballots, election equipment or voters. This means that observers must be able to see and hear election administration processes clearly and effectively to view documents and equipment and must have their questions answered by expert officials. Unfortunately, in recent years, some election offices have blocked observer access by using physical barriers such as cardboard over windows or using outdated pandemic rationales, including unreasonable distances that required observers to use binoculars to view the process. Still, others have denied access to Republican and Democrat congressional observers based on a misunderstanding of the process or the law. Those restrictions rightfully raised questions among voters who deserve transparent, free, and secure elections. Through an open and productive observation process, we can increase public confidence and election for voters of all political parties and enhance election operations without adding unnecessary burden or disruption to the election administrators. Today we will hear from experts about why we must ensure that election observers have access, election observation should never be a partisan issue. Regardless of one's party preference, all voters benefit from having well-trained observers on the ground. I look forward to working together to ensure that the unnecessary restrictions we've seen play out in recent years do not continue, and instead we work to increase access and transparency for all voters.",

        "transcript": " As the former Secretary of State of Florida, I know well how important preparation and planning are to the administration of elections. And in order for Americans to have confidence in their elections, voters need to have equal access to voting. This includes polling stations having the necessary equipment and resources to allow all voters voices to be heard. The concern county as we've heard is failure. In order for Chairman, we have not heard. Is the former Secretary of State Chairman, I yield back. The gentleman yields back, Ms. Lee is now recognized for five minutes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As the former Secretary of State of Florida, I know well how important preparation and planning are to the administration of elections. And in order for Americans to have confidence in their elections, voters need to have equal access to voting. This includes polling stations having the necessary equipment and resources to allow all voters voices to be heard. As the current minister of the state, I would like to ask you to enter into the record a brief statement from Bernadette Hiwish, a voter who had difficulty voting last November. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to read an excerpt from this statement. I arrived at the polling location at 6.45 AM. I was the first person from the Mayflower section of Wilkes Bar to sign in. After doing this, the poll workers were then told not to sign anyone in because the machines were not working correctly. It was going on for approximately 7.40 AM and I had to get back to work when I asked for a provisional ballot. I was not happy doing it this way, but because I was already signed in, I could not leave and come back. I went back to the polling location around 7.30 to see if I could have in my provisional ballot poll and vote by machine. I knew it was a long shot, but was not confident my vote would be counted. Commissioner Palmer, I would like to address my questions to you. First, isn't it true that the EAC issued warnings to local election officials that there might be paper shortages in 2022? Yes, ma'am. That was a number of months prior to the election, including back into the primary that there were shortages and paper stops. Isn't it also correct that the EAC advised jurisdictions that they should be taking steps to ensure that they had the necessary supply of paper to be prepared for the 2022 election? In conjunction with our partners, we issued those warnings that they needed to prepare as early as possible. In fact, there were deadlines that look, if you're ordering past this date, you're not insured to have adequate paper. And for those jurisdictions that did follow the warnings and the advice that was issued by the EAC about ensuring that that supply was in place sufficiently in advance of the 2022 election, they were successful. Were they not? No, they were. Yes. Commissioner Palmer, are you familiar with voting systems testing and certification? Yes, ma'am. Are you also familiar with standards and best practices that are used to maintain election integrity and security during the voting process? Yes, ma'am. In your opinion, is it appropriate for an election administrator at a precinct to be using standard paper for the purpose of tabulating ballots? No, that's not a security feature. That ensures that every ballot's being cast on, ballot stock, a mark since ballot, and not just a piece of paper. So it's a security feature. So once you dismiss that, you are opening it up to other issues. And that's why it's not a best practice. And is the EAC willing or has the EAC provided guidance to state and local election officials about the types of stock or the types of stock that can be used with certain voting systems? Yes. So when a voting system comes into an accredited lab for testing, the manufacturer provides that data on what the link, the thickness of the different types of ballots or paper or stock that would be used. And so it's tested to those. It's not tested to paper or other configurations. And so once it's certified to that, the manufacturer and the user has an understanding of what ballot stock could be used with that voting equipment. Again, it's a very regimented process. So once you are outside that using regular pieces of paper, that's really, you're breaking down one of the security features of the process. Is that certification process an important part of ensuring the security of elections? I think so because what it shows is that we are testing these systems for different manufacturers over and over with upgrades. And it shows that the system will work under different circumstances. And so we will certify that at the federal level. And in fact, many states also have a certification process to ensure that the ballots that are used in your county or your state will work on those voting machines. And would you share with us how the EAC can be involved with helping states identify and implement best practices when it comes to this testing and certification? Well, we have a clearinghouse where we offer best practices to states and issues such as this. We have a subject matter experts and elections and a testing and certification. These are technical experts. And so we hope to provide assistance to the states and localities when they need it on these type of issues. Thank you, Commissioner Palmer. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.",

        "transcript": " members of the subcommittee for joining us today. As the former Florida Secretary of State and Chief Elections official, I am passionate about ensuring that every state administers safe and secure elections and that voters across America have confidence in our election system. Each member of the subcommittee brings unique experience with elections and I look forward to the work we can accomplish together. I believe both Republicans and Democrats have a common goal of ensuring that every eligible American citizen has an opportunity to vote and for their ballot to be counted and to be secure. Each of our states share many of the same challenges and we will work together to ensure we're addressing cyber and physical infrastructure, emergency management strategies and that we provide insight to states across America about best practices and tried and true methods for conducting secure and accurate elections. Where we see states succeeding, we will shine a light on their important work and where we see states falling short, we will work to bring transparency to their challenges and to serve as a resource to help improve their elections process. While we may not always agree about the best policies to implement or recommend to the states, I am confident in our ability to promote our shared interests and to always work professionally and efficiently together. The Constitution tells us that states, not the federal government, have primary authority and responsibility to set election laws and to administer federal elections. To that end, I am pleased to welcome today's witnesses from Ohio, Louisiana and Florida. Three states that are getting elections right and can share some of the policies and practices that have led to their success. It's important to hear from them about what their states are doing well. As a member from Florida, I am the first to acknowledge that our state didn't always run smooth elections. Most people here will still be familiar with the infamous hanging chat election of 2000. But over the last two decades, we have continued to identify areas for improvement and led the way to addressing those issues without top down mandates from Washington, DC. Today, Florida has an effective and thorough elections code, procedures and safeguards. I am proud that Florida is now a national leader in election administration and is an example of how continual review and improvement can lead to sustained success in elections, integrity and administration. Data shows that after some states implement key election integrity measures, they experience increased voter turnout. That's why I think a great place to start this discussion is by reflecting on the 2022 midterms that just occurred where elections administration was performed at a very high level. I'd like to applaud the vast majority of states and localities for their work. We should celebrate those states like those represented here today that have continually found ways to improve their process and to build voter turnout and voter confidence. It's simple. When voters have confidence that their ballot will count, they are more likely to vote. In Georgia following efforts to increase voter confidence through Senate Bill 202, after lessons learned in previous years. There was all time record turnout for a midterm election with more votes cast than in any previous midterm. Despite enduring criticisms of election integrity measures and aspersions claiming that election turnout would be suppressed by reforms, Georgia had record breaking midterm early voting turnout, record breaking midterm absentee votes cast, and more election day votes cast in the 2022 runoff than on election day in the 2022 general election. In the January 2021 runoff or on general election day in 2020. In Louisiana, their midterm featured several strong voter integrity measures like requiring photo identification to vote in person and the state offering to provide free voter ID for voters that did not have one. Not to mention the state's efforts to conduct elections during hurricane season. Ohio just signed into law key election integrity measures including requiring photo ID to vote both in person and by absentee male ballot. And now they're working to improve transparency even more. These are all huge wins for voters and these efforts should be celebrated. Over the past 20 years we've seen distrust in our elections processes and outcomes on both sides of the aisle. And while this will always be a process with room for improvement, it's important that we take a moment to celebrate the successes many states have achieved over the past several years to build election integrity and promote voter faith in elections and confidence in their outcomes while also working to promote voter turnout and engagement. We will work wherever possible to share accurate information with the public about elections and the integrity of our process. And as all our states learn how to better serve their voters through improvements and efforts in elections administration, this committee should promote information sharing between the states so they can learn from each other and implement best practices regarding elections without pushing a DC based takeover or mandates. I look forward to hearing more from our witnesses about how states can continue to strengthen our nation's elections together through collaboration and commitment to effective policies and voter education. We can strengthen our nation's elections infrastructure and work toward building confidence in the security of each state's elections, the strength of our infrastructure and the integrity of our results.",

        "transcript": " the next week. The next week. The next week. Fox News, this morning, menacee E.L. Mark Zuckerberg feeling bad. Yeah, feeling bad for caving to the Biden-Harris White House, who he admits pressured him and his company into censoring COVID content. Zuckerberg writing, quote, in 2021, senior officials at the Biden administration, including those from the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 related content, including humor, satire, and express significant frustration. When we did not meet their demands, I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it. GOP, Congresswoman, Laurel Lee, sits on the House of Dissarial Committee, and this is a big moment for her. What do you take from this confession? Well, first and foremost, this is a great victory for the first amendment. For Mr. Zuckerberg to come out and acknowledge that information was suppressed about COVID, everything when we saw President Trump and people like Governor DeSantis trying to share information with the public about the efficacy of therapeutics, about lockdowns, and whether they were working, you know, at the time they were vilified. And information from people who had opinions was suppressed. And to see Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledging this is really important. It shows the links that the Biden administration went to try to shut this information down. And the other thing that he mentioned in the letter that's really critical is that the Biden administration went to try to shut this information down. And the other thing that's really critical is an acknowledgement that the Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed. And that's something that we have spent so much time in judiciary working on and trying to bring to light is that we have 51 intelligence officers basically like to the American people and try to cast this as Russian disinformation when it wasn't. And that information was suppressed in the lead up to the election. So it's very important for us to be able to show, you know, these are the real facts of what was going on then and the links to which this administration was going to try to hold back this information from the American people. But remember, when the laptop was out there, President Trump was president. So somehow the challenging party had more sway with the FBI and other agencies than the one in power, which is bizarre. Meanwhile, the White House just given us this statement on this. When it confronted with a deadly pandemic, this administration encouraged responsible actions to protect the safety and our position has been clear and consistent. We believe tech companies and our private actors should take into account their effects their actions have on the American people while making independent choices about the information they present. So if you bring up something like Iver Mectin, that's being irresponsible in whose eyes? In some official's eyes? In other people's eyes, it didn't. That's the big question. If you went against what they thought was right, then you're wrong until further notice. That's a bad precedent. It absolutely is. And the whole idea of the First Amendment is that it allows us to express contrary ideas, to bring those out into the public square and let the public get to the bottom of what's the correct information and what's worse, history tells the story and we now know what the data shows us about the fact that there were effective therapeutics, the fact that it was appropriate to be prioritized in seniors in the vulnerable. So, you know, not only was it wrong for them to try to suppress opposing viewpoints, the actual data that we now have related to the pandemic demonstrates that these positions they were suppressing that many of them were actually correct and that the public would have benefited from having them out there and getting the option to make their own choices. Now we know a lot of the so-called facts were wrong. Yesterday you went over to Butler Pennsylvania because you remember the task force investigating the assassination attempt. Then I just decide of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. You haven't received everything you've requested. Your whole committee hasn't. They've requested documents from the DHS, from the FBI and others. So, what was your takeaway from what you saw physically there and from what you expected to see? One of the really key things about going to the site and seeing it is that you get the sense of exactly how small it is. This is not a large area. It's very rural. Even as a lay person, it's clear what the buildings are, what's in the area, and what needs to be secured. So, it really underscores just how inexplicable this catastrophic security failure was that this was allowed to happen. The other thing that is clear is that there were serious communication and coordination problems. State and local law enforcement are a big part of securing a site like this, of securing a rally. But it is evident from the investigation that we've been conducting already that there was a lack of communication and a lack of coordination. So, one of the things we want to be sure we do is understand how that fell apart because that's a key element to ensuring that this doesn't happen for future rallies while these protecties are still out on the trail. And Kong is going over time, but we know nothing about the assassin. Why do they have to quickly cremate the body? We don't know how he made the IEDs. They say intelligence experts say they still have an unencrypted, his tech devices. Well, that's, and that is the key information that is missing that we're still needing to develop from the FBI, from Secret Service, is who was this kid? What was his motivation? Did he work alone? Did he work with someone else? That's what we're still missing as we're trying to pull information from that phone. So, in the coming weeks, that will be one of the key focuses of the committee. I wish people were more curious. Like you guys are, Congresswoman, thanks so much. I'm Steve Doosie. I'm Brian Killme.

        "transcript": " of elections and helping when requested to facilitate today's election. As with any election, before a voter goes to the polls today, they should check with their local supervisor for polling locations. As is true in every election, the most current and up-to-date polling place information is going to be on the voter's respective supervisor of election website. Additionally, instead of relying on information that has been shared on social media about precincts and voting information, voters should rely on trusted sources for information regarding their polling places and regarding what is happening at their polling places today. Accurate information is with your supervisors of election. Again, for Florida voters who are planning to vote today, questions about polling locations or any other registration or voting matters should go to their supervisor of elections or utilize the division of elections voter information look up tool. This morning, we reached out to all supervisor of elections offices and have been assured that polling locations are prepared and equipped for voters. Supervisors have taken health precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We are also aware of the concerning information just shared by Governor DeSantis. Last week, we moved all polling locations from facilities that would have endangered the health and welfare of residents in assisted living and other facilities that house are medically vulnerable. Voters concerned about COVID-19 should make themselves aware of ways to protect themselves against exposure and follow the guidance they are receiving from health professionals. The Florida Department of State has provided guidance and information to all supervisors of elections about preparing for and mitigating any type of exposure to COVID-19 polling locations. For those voters who will be at the polls today, sanitation and safety are our top priority. Voters of elections are aware of all guidance received from the CDC and the Florida Department of Health. Best practices for hand washing and sanitation, as well as guidance from voting machine manufacturers on how to best sanitize voting machines. We are prioritizing the health of voters and election workers. The division of elections is also in communication with the United States Postal Service to ensure that all returned vote-by-mail ballots that can be delivered are received by supervisor of elections offices by poll closing at 7pm local time. The Department is also monitoring security statewide. Currently, there are no reported issues. The division of elections offers a toll-free voter assistance hotline. That number is 1-866-308-6739 and this operates in both English and in Spanish. Voters can also contact their supervisor of elections office with any questions. Tonight Florida's election results for the Presidential Preference Primary will be available on the Florida Election Watch website, which is FloridaElectionWatch.gov. Voters to the site will be able to track results by county and can also compare statewide and county results. Please be aware that while Florida polls close at 7pm, Florida has two time zones. Voting will not be completed statewide until 7pm Central Time, 8pm Eastern Time. Election results will be published on the Florida Election Watch website after 8pm Eastern Time. We are fortunate in Florida to have numerous options to cast our votes securely and safely. We encourage all the radiance who have not already voted to use those options today. There is still plenty of time. Do we have any questions? Let me ask you, do you have a hand-close company for us inside of North Carolina today or called in early or just didn't show up? Can you address that issue out of the here-of-the-wire? We do know that there were some poll workers who did not report today. Our supervisors of election maintained extensive lists of poll workers and alternate poll workers. So they would be the best source of specific information about how many of those alternate poll workers are in use today. What kind of concern or precautions have been made in terms of potentially somewhat contaminating their mailing balance and then that valley being opened up by somebody in the office down the road? So we've ensured that the supervisors are aware of all guidance that we've received regarding COVID precautions, including both those in their physical space at the precinct locations and any that might be associated with vote-by-mail ballots and hard services. So we are just following the best information that we've received from our health professionals. Basically the governor did some order just a few minutes ago in bars and restaurants. Previously with Bay County there was a more relative to their own building. I guess one I confused about is why the Department of State has not taken any action or recommended any recommendations to be more flexible with the deadlines. And the follow-up question that is, are you all being so strict about these rules because you don't want to set a precedent for November when you think that there might be lawsuits in that? Precinct-based voting is unlike the types of gatherings that we have been advised to avoid in Florida. We are in the presidential preference primary so we are not expecting large crowds or long lines. So the normal and regular protocols and statues that we follow in elections, we believe are consistent with the types of precautions that are being advised and we have shared all of those with supervisors. So at the precinct level our supervisors and our election workers are ensuring that they are following those guidelines and we have been advised by our health officials and the Department of Health that voting in this election is safe for both voters and poll workers who follow that guidance. The vote will would have been heard to change the deadlines to say if it's post-marked by today it still counts. In Florida we're very fortunate to have a number of ways that voters can cast their ballot. Unlike some other states, Floridians can vote on election day. They also had the opportunity to vote in early voting and of course we allow vote-by-mail for all voters who wish to exercise that option. So our voters had numerous ways that they could choose to cast their ballot and can continue to do so today. Madam Secretary, I'm wondering if you already know this any kind of meddling perhaps from outsiders, you mentioned social media and voters' trust, their local election officials. I'm wondering what your office has been doing to address that and what can you do if you see misinformation on social media? We are working very closely with both the local supervisors and also our federal partners and our federal law enforcement partners to ensure that Floridians and voters across the country are aware that accurate timely information should come from your elected officials so that if there is any bad information or incorrect information out there on social media that voters don't rely on it and don't allow that information to affect their behavior or their decision making on election day. So voters who have questions should consult their local supervisor of election, our voter assistance hotline or our website to ensure that the information that they are receiving is accurate. But have you noticed any irregularities? We are monitoring and will be all day to see if there is any information out there that we believe is incorrect and of course our own social media pages and that of supervisors of elections are working consistently throughout the day to be sure that the best most up-to-date information is being provided. Do you have any details on the number of polling sites that have been relocated from places where there was an at-risk population from Coronavirus? Democrats have said that 91 precincts have been moved across 58 counties that they were used to serve and I'm wondering if you have precise details on those. So earlier this week we did announce that any precinct locations that were within an assisted living facility or another facility where our elderly and medically vulnerable reside were being moved. The best most accurate information about exactly how many precincts may have been consolidated or relocated would come from the supervisors of election themselves. We do have links on our Department of State website that will take you to the supervisor sites where that information can be obtained. Secretary, do you have any more questions? How are patients who have COVID-19 that are in the state voting today? So any voter who is currently experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 can still designate someone else to pick up their vote-by-mail ballot for them. There are two affidavits to complete and send with them that I described earlier and but those voters can absolutely still have a designate go take their ballot and get it for them so long as it is returned by 7 p.m. today. If they're out of state you met person filling the bubble, sign and do all this, but if they look at the effects it, like how physically can a person in Ohio say maybe get a vote down here or ballot down here. Physical ballots need to be returned to the supervisors of elections office by 7 p.m. today. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " All right. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to this very special installment of our Florida Talks at Home Series. This evening we're going to have a great conversation with Florida Secretary of State, Laurel Lee. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Keith Simmons. I'm the communications director at Florida Humanities. And so I really want to provide an introduction for Secretary Lee and turn it over to her because I think that's really going to be the best part of this program. I just wanted to mention a couple of things before we get started. The first is that at the end of tonight's presentation, you will receive a short survey in your email. And we ask that you fill that out just to let us know how you enjoyed the program and ways that we can improve these programs in the future. The second thing that I want to mention is that because we're on a little bit of a tight schedule this evening, we're going to have a slightly modified format. I'm going to facilitate a Q&A with Secretary Lee on a range of questions that will hopefully keep a really vibrant conversation going. And so with that, I'm going to go ahead and give everyone a more formal introduction of Secretary Lee. Secretary of State Laurel in Lee was appointed by Governor Ron Desanis as Florida's 36th Secretary of State and began serving in February of 2019. During her 10-year Secretary of State, she has worked to strengthen the state's elections infrastructure and cybersecurity defenses, increased voter registration participation, raised awareness and to protect our state's precious historical resources, and to advance for the arts and culture community libraries and archives. As our state's chief elections officer, Secretary Lee works to ensure accurate, fair, and secure elections in Florida. In 2019, Governor Desanis directed Secretary Lee to conduct a review of our statewide elections infrastructure. In response, Secretary Lee led the Joint Election Security Initiative, or JESI, in partnership with all 67 of Florida's Superbiders of Elections to identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities in Florida's elections infrastructure. JESI represents an unprecedented cooperative partnership between the Department of State and Florida's Superbiders of Elections to enhance cybersecurity statewide. Secretary Lee is committed to encouraging and promoting participation in democracy. She is honored to serve as Florida's Chief Elections Officer during the Centennial anniversary and replication of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and as a member of the Women's Suffrage Centennial Commission. Secretary Lee is Florida's Chief Cultural Officer as well, and as such, she serves as an advocate and an ally for arts and cultural organizations around the state. Secretary Lee also serves as Florida's State Protocol Officer, heading the Office of International Affairs. In this capacity, she works to create and foster strong and productive diplomatic relationships between Florida and other countries. Secretary Lee previously served as a Circuit Court Judge in Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit in Hillsboro County. She was appointed to the Circuit Court by Governor Rick Scott in 2013, and was re-elected without opposition in 2014. During her time as Circuit Court Judge, Secretary Lee presided in the Circuit Civil Division, the Civil Appellate Division, and a domestic relations division. Prior to serving as a judge, Secretary Lee was an Assistant United States Attorney in the Middle District of Florida and Assistant Federal Public Defender in the Middle District of Florida. She has worked in private practice and as a Federal Judicial Law Clerk. Secretary Lee received her bachelor's degree and a jurist doctorate from the University of Florida, where she is a member of Florida Blue Keith. She was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame in 1999. And with that, I'd like to turn the conversation over to Secretary Lee. Well, thank you, Keith, so much for that introduction. And that was an excellent foundation, actually quite thorough, and an excellent foundation for some of the things that we'll be talking about tonight, because it really provided an overview, not just of the Department of State and some of our critical functions, but also specifically some of the important work that we have been doing in the elections realm. So, I really will have three topics that I want to share with you tonight, and then we'll leave time at the end for a discussion and question and answer session. So, the three things I want to share with you tonight, first I'll begin by sharing some demographic information about our state and our voting population, and why it is that Florida is the most interesting state in the United States when it comes to elections. Second, we'll share some information about how to vote in Florida, our voting options, and also what we're doing here at the Department of State to ensure the integrity of the election process and to protect you and your vote this year. Finally, I'll touch on just a little bit about what makes 2020 a very unique election year as compared to other years, and then we'll go to some question answering here from some of the things that might be interesting to all of you. So, I'll start with a little bit of interesting demographic information. So, just today we shared what we refer to as book closing numbers, and what that is is the people in Florida who are registered to vote and registered in time to vote in the upcoming presidential election. And what we saw from those numbers to begin is that we now have over 14 million registered voters in Florida, and our voter registration breakdown is very closely divided between the two major political parties. At this point, we have 5,169,012 registered Republicans, 5,303,254 registered Democrats. So, a very close divide between the two major political parties, but another important feature is that we have 3,753,286 voters with no party affiliation. So, that's a very fast growing voter demographic for us in Florida. And of course, we are also the state in the United States with the third largest population. So, we're a very significant state for election outcomes, and we have a very evenly divided voting population. So, that's how we get our name as a purple state, because a candidate from either of the major political parties can easily win an election state-wide. So, unlike other states where a majority of voters may clearly be in one political party or the other, not so in Florida. So, we are, that's what makes our elections so exciting, and that is also what leads to very, very close election margins. So, a per frame of reference, in 2016, Donald Trump won Florida by 1.2 percentage points. In 2012, President Barack Obama won by 0.9 percentage points. So, you know, of course, we all anxiously await to see what happens here on November 3rd, but if history is any indication, we're expecting that the election in Florida will be close and will be an interesting election to watch. So, another thing that is significant to know about that is that it's one of the reasons that makes civic engagement and each individual voter very important. Each voice, each vote, especially matters. In a state like Florida, where our election margins are so very close. So, one of the things that I always do when I have an opportunity to speak to a group is encourage civic participation. Of course, if you're not registered to vote, get registered to vote, and remember how close those elections are, because every single voter can make a difference. There's several things that we're also encouraging voters to do this year. Because of the coronavirus, which I'll talk about a little more later, things have really changed the selection cycle, where typically you would be seeing candidate forums and community events. Many of those have gone virtual, but it's important to know that they're still happening. So, if you're interested in learning more about a particular political candidate or a particular political issue, still seek that information out, because you will find that all of those candidates and all of those issue groups are still out there very much trying to connect with voters, most have just taken their information and taken their forums and events and placed them online. So, I encourage you all to stay active and engage with the political process just as you would in a normal year and just understand that you might be looking in different places to find those opportunities to interact with candidates. So, the second thing that I want to spend a little time talking about is how to vote in Florida and what we're doing, both the Department of State and your local supervisor of elections, to protect the integrity of our election and also to keep you and your vote safe. So, in Florida, we're very fortunate to have three options for all voters, voting by mail, voting in person, by early voting, and then voting in person on election day. So, one, I'll spend just a minute on vote by mail because of course there has been, we've all heard a bit of a national dialogue around the subject of voting by mail. And it's important for Floridians to know that voting by mail in Florida is safe, it is reliable, and you can have confidence that if you choose to vote by mail, your vote will be counted. Voting by mail in Florida is something that we are very experienced with. This is not a system that we attempted to enact or change as a consequence of the coronavirus. It's actually something that we've been doing successfully for a very long time. Voting by mail in Florida actually dates back in some form or fashion all the way to 1917, and it has existed in much its present format for close to 20 years. So, in Florida, a voter must request a vote by mail ballot when they make that request of a supervisor of election. That request must match an existing voting record. Ballot goes to the voter, the voter fills out and completes his or her ballot, signs it, sends it back, and that signature, again, must match an existing voting record. So, the reason that those steps are important is because they are part of the way that we ensure the integrity of that vote by mail process, that we have those checks in place to enhance the integrity and security and the vote all the way from when it leaves the supervisor's office all the way to when it gets back. So, you know, we're very fortunate to be experienced with this process. Our elections officials know how to use it. Our postal carriers are familiar with it, and so are our voters. So, we here in Florida, I believe, will have a very successful vote by mail operation. Two things that are important to know, particularly if you're a new voter to using that voting option, is first, the vote by mail ballot must be signed, and second, it must be received by 7pm local time on election day. So, it's very important that if you choose to vote by mail, you ensure your ballot gets back to your supervisor of election by 7pm on election day. So, early voting and voting in person on election day, early voting coming up, there's a period where all counties across the state will have early voting. That will be October 24th through 31st. Some counties will have additional early voting days starting as early as this coming Monday. So, early voting will also be coming to you soon as an option for casting a ballot. That's often how I choose to vote. Early voting is a very convenient and easy thing to do, and available, of course, again, for every Florida voter. And then last but not least, we have election day voting on that'll be November 3rd. So, before going out to vote this year, I do encourage everyone to go to your supervisor of elections website and check your precinct on polling location information. Make sure you've got the best, most up-to-date information before you head out to the polls. It's also important to know, and one thing I want to spend a little bit of time talking about is what we're doing to protect you and your vote for those who do choose to vote in person, whether by early voting or voting on election day. So, obviously, we're all experiencing the still the coronavirus pandemic, and we've worked very hard at the state level and the local level to ensure that we are prepared to meet that challenge and keep voters and the voting process safe. Governor DeSantis entered an executive order in response to the pandemic to ensure that local supervisors of elections had the extra support they needed, including directing our State Department of Emergency Management to provide necessary PPE. So, face masks, hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes, to ensure that all local election officials had all of the equipment and supplies that they might need to keep those polling locations clean and safe for voters. We will be observing social distancing in the polls. So, whether you're standing in line or actually voting, you can expect that social distancing and public health guidance will be observed. Aside, note to that, one thing we might also see, though, because supervisors are working so hard to keep precinct locations sanitized and observe social distancing, voting may take a little bit longer this year. So, please understand that as voters are spaced out, six feet apart, and polling locations are sanitized thoroughly, that it might just take a little bit longer this year. So, please plan ahead and try to be a little bit patient with your supervisor of election if you do see a bit of a line on election day. Let's see, I also want to talk a bit about what we're doing on the cybersecurity front. That, I think, is very important information for all Floridians to have to know that once they cast that ballot, that their ballot is counted and their ballot is secure. When Keith went through the introduction of me, he actually covered a great summary of some of the important work that we've been doing with supervisors of elections to ensure that we had developed a strong baseline of cyber and physical security across the state. Over this past year and a half, our cyber security experts at the Department of State have gone every single one of Florida's 67 counties. And in collaboration with each of those supervisors and their staff conducted an election-specific risk assessment to see where we were and then worked with those supervisors to ensure that any vulnerabilities that were identified were addressed or mitigated prior to the election. So, we also work very closely with our federal partners, both Department of Homeland Security and the FBI work very closely with us to ensure that we have information that we need and resources that we need to stay strong and be prepared for any threats that might come to our elections infrastructure. And we do face serious threats. You know, every single day, domestic and foreign actors attempt to penetrate our network, and every single day we defend against those threats. And through our election security initiative with the supervisors, we've worked very hard to be sure that we have things in place like hardware, software, updated voting systems, upgraded firewalls, and all of the tools that we believe that we need to try to be continually prepared to meet those threats as they evolve and emerge. We've made significant investments in all of those things that I just mentioned, both federal dollars and state dollars, to make sure that we had the tools, equipment, and expertise that were required in today's voting environment. And one thing that is also a really great component of the joint election security initiative is, you know, we recognized, and I learned over the course of time through working with cybersecurity experts that you can make these critical investments. You can invest millions and millions of dollars. But if you don't also train your employees, you know, all of us who are working in the field of elections, if we all don't also understand, what is a fishing email? What is social engineering? What are the tools that some of these bad actors are using to try to manipulate our behavior that, you know, if an employee clicks the wrong email, we could still be made vulnerable despite these critical investments. So we've also focused a lot on training to try to be sure that anyone who's touching the elections infrastructure understands those threats and is prepared to identify and fight against those threats. We refer to that as our human firewall. So we've been working on building up and strengthening our human firewall in addition to our cyber and physical firewalls. So one final thing on that is how, just how important our partners both federally and locally really are because, you know, one thing I think that we all recognized early is that we are going to succeed or fail as a state. And we share these common goals. I think every single one of us, whether it's the 67 supervisors or our incredible staff up here at the Department of State, we all want this to be an election that Florida can be proud of and have confidence in. And so we are very unified in our goals and our objectives and really it has been just an extraordinary pleasure working with all of them to prepare for the upcoming election. All right, so my third topic and then we'll go to questions is I want to spend just a moment on what makes this particular election unique. And of course, the number one issue that's making this particular election unique is the coronavirus. So we had all been working to be ready for the election and really thought we had thought of everything, everything from the cybersecurity to the physical security of our offices to preparing for hurricanes and other natural disasters and really thought we were prepared for everything. And like so many different sectors and industries along came the coronavirus and it changed everything. So we really had to stop and you know, be followed the CDC guidelines, see what they were, how are they going to apply to the way that we operate. What if anything that we need to change and adapt to to ensure that we could keep our election workers and our voters safe at the polls. And we had an election, of course, we had our primary election back in August. And that was an opportunity to see all of these, all of the plans and procedures that we put in place at work. And I'm very pleased to report that it was very successful that you know, as we talked about earlier that our elections officials and our poll workers ensure that our precinct facilities were kept clean, that voters were spaced out, that they all were masks. Everything possible that we can do to make sure that voters who choose to vote in person can have confidence in that process and feel free to exercise that as their option to vote. Of course, another important feature is that when it comes to vote by mail, we are what's referred to as a no-excuse required state. In other words, anyone can vote by mail. You don't have to fit a certain criteria or be out of town or anything like that. Anyone who's so desires, if a voter is more comfortable, anyone who wants to vote by mail is entitled to do that in Florida. And supervisors of election are also working very hard to make sure that it's there are many opportunities to return those ballots. So any voter who has opted to vote by mail and has that ballot can either put it in the mail to send it back. You can drop it off at any early voting site while those early voting sites are open. Or even on election day, you can take it back to the supervisor of elections office if you wish. So I know we're covering a lot of information. So if any of you have specific questions, if there's something that I mentioned that you want to know more about, I highly encourage you to check out the Department of State website or your supervisor of elections website. We have immense amounts of material about all of these subjects and also a voter assistance hotline that any voter can call if you have questions about what to do or what your options may be. So other things that make this election unique, of course, we got a lot of federal dollars to help address the coronavirus pandemic. And that was very helpful. That helped supervisors of election do everything from pay for extra postage to different equipments to get extra staff to help process an increase in vote by mail ballots. A key difference that we see is a significant increase in the number of voters who are choosing to vote by mail. So historically, we would often see voters divide about evenly, a third to third, a third from each of those three options. And in August primary, we saw 60% of voters choose to vote by mail. So we're expecting that to continue again in the general election that we think we'll have a very high volume of voters who opt to vote by mail. So that's another thing that is unique about the upcoming general election. So with that, I'm going to bring this to a conclusion so we can go to questions. But in conclusion, I want you all to walk away from tonight knowing that we have made significant and critical investments in our elections infrastructure to be sure that you and your vote are safe. As the nation's largest swing state, your vote could absolutely make the difference. So it's critical that you get out there and vote. Civic engagement also means one thing that's very important that I'm sure we'll cover in the questions and answers. I want to be sure that I touch on before we close out tonight is the concept of misinformation and disinformation. Part of being civically engaged is being sure that when you go seek out information that you're getting it from a reliable source, that you're getting good, accurate information that you can count on. And one great way to do that is to go to your supervisor of elections or the Department of State. Remember that you have options when it comes to casting your ballot so you can choose the one that is the best for you in Florida. And most important, I like to leave this with every group I have the chance to spend some time with is this. The concept that elections are partisan, you know, particularly at a moment like this when we're getting so close to Election Day, you know, we all see that elections can be very partisan. But elections administration is not. And your supervisor of elections and our team here at the Department of State, we work for every Floridian. Regardless of how you may choose to vote or what your party affiliation is, that we're here for every Floridian. Elections administration is not a partisan business. So we want all Florida voters to know that they can have confidence in the integrity of our elections and the security of their vote. So with that Keith, I would welcome any questions that you have or any matters that would be good for discussion. Thank you so much. I think for that fast meeting inside in terms of our process. And I do have a couple questions that I was thinking of as we were, you were talking and one of the things that I'm kind of curious about is as our state's chief elections officer, I wonder if you could just tell us what's your favorite memory or experience with boating? My most memorable voting experience was the first time that I was personally acquainted with a candidate. And this particular candidate was in, let's see, it was a primary election who's running for Congress and had a primary and there was a runoff in the primary election. And so it was kind of an extra round that nobody was expecting to have. And I remember at the time I was a new lawyer. I was still relatively new at my law firm and in the day that this election was scheduled, was a very busy day at work and it was pouring rain. And I really had to make myself get up and go to leave my desk and go and vote. And my friend who was a candidate actually won. But by the smallest, it was a handful of votes. And I will never forget it because that was what first really resonated with me that voting is not the kind of action where we can sit back and think someone else will do it. That someone else will do it and it will express what I want to see happen in our society or it will adequately express my views and what I want for the future of my community. It's very important that all of us learn about candidates, learn about issues and rain or no rain that we all get out there and vote. Well, I think certainly like you said, rain or no rain, global pandemic or not or anything else that's going on. There's certainly options for Floridians to express their opinion and to exercise their right to vote. And I think certainly everyone that's watching this presentation will certainly do that. One of the questions I kind of have is related to this. So, you know, we are certainly going to be going through the voting process over the next couple of days and weeks. And it's very common in the past for a candidate to be declared the winner on election night, particularly for the presidency. But the process itself in terms of declaring candidate and following through is a little bit more involved than that. So, I wonder if you could just give us an overview of how exactly does it work? How are these votes tallied? I know that there's something called certification that the secretary provides for different elections. And so, what does that entail? Sure. So, you're obviously right. This is a really interesting subject and something that you're going to hear secretaries of state talking about across the country. So, I'm very optimistic that we likely will have unaffordable results on election night in Florida. There are a couple of reasons why we're differently situated than some other states. And one is that our supervisors of election can start canvassing vote by mail ballots as they come in. And many of them are already doing that. Governor DeSantis actually extended the amount of days and time that they had to conduct that canvassing as vote by mail ballots in his executive order. So, our supervisors are already doing that work and keeping up with those balances they come in. And in some other states that work cannot begin until election day. Another important difference is that our ballots, our vote by mail ballots are all due on election day by 7 p.m. Some other states, that's not the case. Some of them have a deadline that can be days or more after election day. So, I've heard a number of my counterparts in other states talk about how, hey, we're not going to have election day this year. We're going to have election week or election month. And again, I don't think in Florida that that's nearly as likely to be a challenge. That said, one of the things that your question touched on that's important to remember is that what we see on election night is unofficial preliminary results. Those are not the official election night results. So, we will get those in on election night, the unofficial results. We do have two time zones. So, we don't announce anything at the Department of State until the Central Time Zone polls are also closed. And then after that point, the unofficial results are due to the Department of State on November 7, four days after the election. And the official results from the supervisors of elections are due on November 15. So, after that, we will certify the official results of the election. I think that's certainly great information to know just that we can have a general sense of how the election turned out. But it is really that certification at the end that sort of puts the seal on on everything. Is that right? That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And so, I think that something that's such a moment as event like an election and something where a lot of us as citizens, we go, we do our part, we see the results and then we kind of go on with our lives. But I imagine if you're a supervisor of elections or the Secretary of State, you know, once an election is certified and it's officially over so to speak, how soon are you starting to prepare for the next election? And what does that process look like? I mean, is it a multi-year process? You get somewhat of a break in between or when do you have to start thinking about the next set of elections? Yes, elections and preparation for elections is a job that never stops. So, many of the things that we're actually doing now to prepare for November 3rd are actually systems and processes and investments we're making that aren't just for this election but are for the coming elections in in future years. So, we will immediately begin work on the 2022 elections as soon as as we finish this one. So, it's very much a year-round task in the division of elections. Similarly, when we talk about and one thing that's been a subject of particular interest in this election cycle because of the world we live in today is cybersecurity and and election security and in that realm, one of the things that I like to say is that cybersecurity is a race with no finish line. So, the threats we face, the threat landscape that we confront in the world of cybersecurity is constantly evolving. So, that is a challenge we'll continue to meet every day, a constantly evolving challenge that we'll never stop working on. So, we really are in a state of perpetual motion and perpetual preparation when it comes to elections and making sure that we stay current, making sure that we stay in constant communication contact with our partners and being prepared for any eventuality that might come up in the future. And certainly be assuring that you have all that work going on, you know, just consistently in terms of preparing for elections. And I wanted to go back just for a second if we could to talking about when it comes to a single election. And so, you're in that voting booth and you see like in this year it's a presidential election year, so you have presidents. It's not uncommon to also have senators, members of Congress and you know, the list kind of goes down down ballot, so to speak. And wonder if you've come across in your work as Secretary of State, is there a really sort of unique office or position that some entity that the people for to get to elect, I'm thinking sort of like the stereotypical dog catcher that we kind of heard about, you know, as a possibility. Is there anything really like that that you've seen? Oh, 100%. And you will see offices, typically, you know, down near the end of your local ballot, there will absolutely, in many counties, be offices that are less common and less frequently known, things like bridge authorities, port authorities, we even have mosquito control districts, soil and water conservation districts, island authorities. We have all kinds of interesting regional or local things that might end up on your ballots. So one thing that's a great exercise for voters is to get your sample ballot. Get your sample ballot from your supervisor of election, see what is in that lineup. So if there's something that you're not familiar with, you have a chance before you get, before you have to actually mark that ballot, you have a chance to do all the research or study that you might like to do. Same about constitutional amendments. If you have any questions or things that you want to know or understand about those constitutional amendments, and whether to vote yes or no, it's a great opportunity to read those in advance before you get to the polls. I think that's absolutely fantastic advice. And we talked about this a little bit I think in my introduction of you, and you mentioned some of these things I think earlier in our conversation, talking about the Secretary of State. You are the chief election officer, but also the chief cultural officer, the protocol officer. So this isn't directly related to voting per se, but I guess if you know trying to explain your job sort of in a nutshell, what all would you say a Secretary of State does or what all is a Secretary of State responsible for? That is a great question because we are an incredibly diverse agency, and you know you really covered a lot of the things that we touch on in your introduction. So you know we work in, we have the Division of Arts and Culture where we support arts and culture agencies around the state. Of course here is a place that we intersect a great deal with humanities and the types of things that we bring to communities to enrich them and make them stronger. So our culture is a big part of what we do. And I'm really looking one of the things I'm looking forward to post-election day is the opportunity to spend some more time on these other parts of the Department of State. We have the Division of Historical Resources, which is responsible for preserving and promoting and sharing Florida's unique history and are we have an incredible collection of historical objects and artifacts. We actually have over 3.5 million artifacts in our collection that date all the way back 14,000 years to the Paleo-India period. So we have one of the world's most amazing collections of dug out canoes. So I highly encourage if you have another opportunity to check out, we have four museums that house a lot of these great objects. So if you haven't got to check them out, I highly encourage it. We have the State Library and Archives. There two libraries of course remain a vital hub for literacy, technology, connecting a community to the broader world. But they've also really evolved to include some very innovative programming, classes, fitness courses, financial classes. They're even libraries in Florida where you can check out a fishing pole. So if you haven't been to your local library, I highly recommend checking it out. We did bring that last year, the Division of International Affairs. So I frequently will talk to diplomats from foreign countries who are assigned to Florida who are interested in fostering stronger relationships with us, socially, culturally, economically. So I get to spend some time with some really, really fascinating people from around the world in that regard. And then of course we have the Division of Corporations. So there we try to make sure that Florida has a very business and consumer-friendly filing environment. So the bottom line is the Department of State is an incredible place. It is absolutely filled with this set of each so diverse but so important, so special to Florida and who we are as a community and as a culture, as a state. So I absolutely love getting to work in all of these different areas. And again, starting November 4th, it's been a little more time in the other divisions of the Department of State. And that's fantastic. And certainly, Florida humanities has been able to become very well acquainted with you in your office because of that shared interest in arts and culture. And so we're incredibly grateful for the relationship that we've been able to have with the Department of State for a number of years. And I wonder if you could maybe tell us, I think we're going to try to draw down the conversation a little bit. Being a talk just a little bit more about some of your offices' efforts to support arts and culture in Florida. And perhaps what you see is your vision for arts and culture here in our state. Absolutely. Well, and on the subject, we've talked about how the coronavirus has affected elections a great deal. But of course, it's also having incredibly significant and drastic effects on our arts and culture community. And that community is such an incredible part of both what makes Florida such a vibrant and rich place to be, that enriches our communities and strengthens our communities. It is also a huge economic driver in Florida. Arts and culture organizations are a huge part of our tourism industry. And what not only brings people to Florida, but makes them stay. You make some stay for a couple of extra days and take in a show in the museum and a dinner. So not only did many of our arts and culture partners, whether it was the gallery, the performance center, we have to go dark when the pandemic broke out. So we lost their front end revenue. We're also facing emerging here in terms of funding and our space movement. So one of the things that I want her to do as we go into next year is really work hard to try to highlight the challenges that these organizations are on the same floor. So we can be, we find a thing called partner with them to ensure that they're getting the community support, the state and national support that can be put their doors open. And then certainly appreciate again those efforts in that regard. And I certainly would be remiss if I didn't mention that one of the products that we've been able to produce at Florida humanities with the generous support of the Department of State as form magazine. And I would like to just invite our viewers that you can go to Florida Humanities.org and you can access our very rich archive several decades going back in terms of different issues. And recently we've been very honored to have Secretary Lee feature a letter in some of these most recent issues that we've published. And so again we're just very grateful for all the work that you're doing not just for arts and culture but for your entire portfolio as Secretary of State as well as just all the work that you've done on behalf of the people of Florida. So again, just very grateful to you and to your entire staff. Well I appreciate it and some of the many interventions and the libraries have been able to put on together were extremely proud of at the Department of State. So I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to such a beautiful publication. I also think we get to be here with you tonight. It's such an important time for us to be reaching voters and communicating with voters. And so I really appreciate you having been very, very helpful. Absolutely. And again, thank you for the time that you're able to spend with us this evening. We really do appreciate it. I think that we've got a lot of great insight into how our electoral process works but certainly the takeaway I think for everyone who's watching this program is to visit your local supervisor of elections website as well as to visit the website for the Secretary of State to get the most accurate up-to-date information on voted and to then also go out and vote. And certainly one of the most important things that I think we can do in this last few months of this very interesting year that has been 2020. So again, Secretary Lee, thank you for your time this evening. We really do appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. And again, thank you to all of our viewers who are here tonight. Again, you should receive a survey following the conclusion of this program and certainly let us know how we did. And once again, we're looking forward to seeing you again next week. So until then, take care.",

        "transcript": " Give us a sense of when you were coming into work this morning, what was the feeling? Did you feel that this had the potential to happen? What we're seeing right now? We were prepared and anticipated a large crowd. We anticipated a lot of people coming in to make their voices heard, which happens a lot in our nation's capital. But the volume and extent of what is happening right now is more than we had anticipated. And what is it like just to just describe as you're there right now, what's happening? There is a very heavy police presence. A lot of roads around the capital complex perimeter have been blocked off and a lot of capital police out and about. I'm not in the capital building, which is where a lot of the heavy action is right now. But they have been able to reach the capital building and that is something that is unprecedented in my 20 years on capital home. Are you able to look out a window and see what's happening? I'm looking out a window, but I'm not looking at the capital. Our office doesn't look at the capital that's not where our office is situated. So I can't give you a visual of the capital from where I'm looking right now. How close are you? Well, we're about, you know, half a block from the capital, but we're on the other side of the building and we've been instructed to remain in our offices with our doors locked. And I have to ask the obligatory, how are you feeling right now? Are you nervous? I want to make sure that everybody comes out of this safe and it is a little bit of rocking and unsettling, but I have faith in our police and I have sent in a record of people that this will hopefully come to a peaceful end. And to be clear, the capital police did have a game plan. We're not going to tip off what it is, but they had told you to be ready, right? They had a plan in place. They did have roads that they had closed off in anticipation of a heavy protest presence today. And so they were very prepared. The National Park Services here as well. The DC Mayor called in the National Guard to assist with everything. So they were definitely ramping up. I think that the volume is just a little bit more than was originally anticipated. Have you been in touch with Congressman Franklin and has he texted you to tell you how he is right now? I have been in contact with him. He texted me to let me know that he is safe, that they are doing well and they're ready to continue to do the people's business. This is the opportunity presented stuff. And what is happening? Are the congressmen actually locked down right now in that chamber? Yes, they are. They're locked down in the house chamber for their safety. And I think that would be the case until they fill it up for them to either resume house business or for them to depart the capital building. And that was going to be my next question at this point. House businesses on hold. Correct. They have put the house in recess until the safety of everyone has been resolved. You've been there 20 years. Ever seen anything like this before? No sir. Well, we'll share that from your life there. What does it feel like to see this? Unfortunately, it's historic. It's not the kind of history we like to write, but how does it feel to be part of this and see it firsthand? There are mixed emotions because I very much support the right of the American people to make their voices heard and to share their views. We have protests on a very regular basis here in the United States capital. The nation's capital is where people come to express their voice, make sure that it is heard and I support that and I embrace that. I just hope that everything that is happening now can be resolved in a very peaceful manner. And it is a presence and a feel that I have not experienced in my 20 years. On settling for you? Well, it will be, isn't settling. I just pray that everything comes out peacefully that we can have a peaceful resolution. People can continue to feel that their voices are being heard. I can assure you that the members of Congress and the United States Senate are listening, but how this will all play out is to be determined. And are you getting some sort of messages because when I called Gifur if you said I think they just set off some tear gas? No, I saw on Fox News that there were reports of tear gas in the US, in the US capital and Congressman Franklin had texted me that they had been given gas masks. And I think that's hopefully out of an abundance of caution, but clearly safety is the first priority.",

        "transcript": " Welcome to the 2020 virtual candidate forum. Our desire is to create informed voters by giving the plant city community an opportunity to meet every candidate on their ballot. At the Greater Plant City Chamber of Commerce, we are a connector and convener in the community of current and rising leaders. When we all work together, we are Plant City Strong. This event would not be possible without community involvement. We would like to thank Tampa Electric, Friday Productions, South Florida Baptist Hospital, the Hillsborough County Farm Bureau, and the many other generous supporters. Without further ado, let's hear from this candidate. Hello, my name is Stephen Olin-Camp. I am a member of the Greater Plant City Chamber of Commerce, and I have the pleasure of serving on the Government Affairs Committee. Our committee has prepared a few questions for every candidate on the ballot, running, or a position that will represent residents of the plant city community. Today, I am here with Scott Franklin, who is running for a U.S. House of Representatives District 15. Scott, will you please give us a quick introduction of yourself so our viewers can get to know you? All right, good morning. Thanks, Stephen. My name is Scott Franklin. I am running for the Lakeland City, sorry, I am on the Lakeland City Commission, running for U.S. Congress at this time. I have got three jobs going right now between my day job and campaigning and being on the City Commission. I joined Limerup Shaw Insurance in 2000. I have been the President there, became President in 2003, CEO since 2005, and we merged that company into Baldwin Kristen Sherman Partners on January 1st. We have been a best company to work for for the last four years from the Florida trend and the best places to work in Polk County for 13 past running years. I have been on the Lakeland Chamber Commerce Board of Directors, also the Board of Governors, or the Executive Committee. I have chaired our Executive Committee of the Lakeland Economic Development Council. A lot of the number of different chamber type events such as the Leadership Lakeland Leadership Polk and Leadership Florida, I have been on the Board of Governors for the Tampa Bay Partnership, and I currently serve on the Board of Overseasers for the Florida Southern School of Business. The 26th year Navy veteran, I graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. I was a career naval aviator before coming back to Lakeland to run my business. I got an MBA along the way and doing that. In the 20 years that I have run, our company here in the insurance business, I have the opportunity to work with hundreds of businesses throughout the area. I develop risk management plans for them, so I understand how their business models work, the threats to their profit and help protect them. But also running my own business, I know how to make payroll, and I've known the challenges of leading the business through the hard times, through the great recession, and also growing it through the good times. I took that experience three years ago to work for the Lakeland City Commission, and now I'd like to do that at the federal level where they seem to not be able to balance budgets. Thank you, Scott. So tell us, why are you running for office? Well, a couple of reasons. One is as I was starting to loot you there. Our federal government is out of control. They spend my and ways that none of us would ever do as business owners. And at the local level, the state level, and everywhere else, we seem to manage to balance our budgets, but the federal government can't manage to do that. I'm worried that they're mortgaging our children's future. For the first time in my life, we were always told that our children should have a better life than we've had, and we can prepare that way for them. Our kids don't believe that now, and they see what we're doing in squandering their futures. They don't think necessarily the America's brightest days ahead or ahead, and I do, but I think it's time that we bring control back to Washington. Thank you, Scott. Okay, during your time in office, what do you plan to do for the plant city community? Well, first and foremost, my top priority would be, particularly now during coronavirus, getting America back to work. And we've got record high unemployment, stimulus packages have helped. I think in the hindsight, when we look back over those layer, we're going to see that we wasted a lot of money. I think we need to be incentivizing people to work instead of not work. I have a lot of hope for the next round of stimulus spending that's coming out that we're going to be a little more careful on how we do that, we don't incentivize people by paying them more to stay home than it would be to get them back to work. I think people believe inherently and honest good work, hard work for honest pay and to pay them to not do that is a distance and I think it leads to unhappiness. But getting America back to work, I'm a believer in small limited government low taxes. So I'd like to see our tax cuts, the President's tax cuts made permanent. I'd like to continue to reduce the bureaucracy in government. I'm a fan of the two-for-one rule. For every piece of new bureaucracy that we label, or we start applying to businesses, we eliminate two others. We need to continue to strengthen our national defense. But more locally, from a business perspective, a high priority for me would be coming up with a significant healthcare reform that would start with a permanent repeal of Obamacare. We were promised better, faster, cheaper. That's not been the case. Medical costs continue to skyrocket. And as a business owner, that's frustrating. I'm actually in the business where we sell health plans to companies. And there's nothing else we do in our lives that has less transparency than in the world of medical care. So I'd like to bring transparency to it. I think we need to, well, any kind of reform would certainly cover pre-existing conditions. So that would be, that's a non-negotiable. But I'd also like to see us develop the ability for small businesses to band together into association plans. That's been a high priority for chambers. I know I've worked with our Lakeland Chamber to try to do that. And we're blocked at every turn. It's interesting that as a small business owner who then went to the Lakeland City Commission, I found that my health insurance rates for my family, by me and being a member of the Lakeland City Government were about half of what I could get as a small business owner. And there's really no reason for that. There's no reason why small businesses couldn't band together and get that same bulk pricing that larger companies do. So that would be a high priority for me. Those are all, those are just some of the things, but that would, that would get us started. But overall, I'm a free trade guy. I know the president is trying to, we're trying to get China to play by the rules. So I'm normally one who would not be in favor of things like tariffs, but that's predicated on the assumption that everyone's playing by the same set of rules. So I think renegotiating the NAFTA agreement is a right step in the right direction. But I think we need to be looking at all of our treaties and make sure they're fair to American workers, our employees here. You mentioned the virus. Did it affect the virus? There will be a decrease in tax revenues. How will you adjust the budget shortages? And where will you cut and where will you prioritize? Well, I would certainly start by looking at the things that are in some of these packages that we're spending now. And I would not be bailing out states and governments that that haven't managed to manage their budgets successfully. Like we have here in Florida for those states that don't have balanced budgets, I think they need to figure out their own issues. And that means they have to declare bankruptcy before they could receive any federal help. And I would certainly do that. I think we need to take a real hard look at some of the entitlement programs that we have. Long term, I'll be 56 later this summer when I came into the workforce decades ago. I was told that social security would be busted and I should never count on receiving any of that. I think we need to take care of our seniors and nothing we should do would impact anyone who's currently retired or approaching retirement. But I do think we need to look very hard at folks coming into the workforce and restructure some of these long term promises. The reality is when social security was started back in the 30s, it's actually old age and survivors to my disability insurance and dependence insurance. And it was never meant for people to retire and live in another 30 years or so just off of the government doll. So I think it should have been indexed along the way to be more reflective of life expectancy. But you know that said we've got to take care of people who put their faith in the government all these years and paid into the system. We would do nothing that would affect them. But I think for young people coming into the workforce we need different kinds of plans. And I also believe more of a more of a defined contribution program than a defined benefit plan. So things like 401Ks that work successfully in the business world, I'd like to see that expanded on the federal level. Scott, I'd have selected what is your priority for your first term in office? Well, if you'd asked me that six months ago, I would have said other things that right now, clearly COVID is not going away. I think we're going to feel the effects of that. Even if we get a vaccine by the end of this year, the impact we're seeing on our economy is going to take us, I think, years potentially before we get back to the great norm that we had going into 2020. So I think efforts to get America back to work, I think we need to focus, again, I've mentioned health care before. We need to continue strengthening our national defense that's been depleted through the Obama years. And I think President Trump's done a good job of getting us back on the right path of that over the last four years. But I also, I think, well, let's see, defense, the tax plans, reducing our government waste that we see at every turn. Those would be the first things to get us going. But I think more than anything else, the highest priority right now is going to be finding a way to reduce the spread of just government overspending and getting our people back on their feet. All right, Scott, that's it for our questions. Anything else that you'd like the viewers to know before we go? I think when folks have an opportunity to vote in the primary, on August 18th, and then again, in November, I think we have a clear choice. If you look at the candidates and the folks, I would urge everyone to take a real hard look at people's backgrounds and their skill sets and what they bring to the table. And I do believe that of all the folks in the race, that I bring the broadest depth of experience to the table from both a leadership background with a career in the military. I know it's like to serve our country. I know it's like to lead a small business and medium-sized business through hard times and through tough times. And I've been involved in our community and have a demonstrated track record of leadership for over 20 years back here in the in the Tampa Bay area. So I would appreciate people, everyone getting out and vote. I know it's going to be tough to get people to the polls this time, but I think this is one of the most critical elections in our lifetime, probably the most critical. And please get out there and vote on August 18th and I'd appreciate your support. Thank you. All right, Scott, thank you for your time. We appreciate it. Thanks.",

It's got Franklin who is currently in the running for Congress here in the 15th Congressional District. Excited to welcome you both to the show today. Glad that you could be with us. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Engle. You know, it's an honor to have you both with us for the show. And today's episode, I want to talk about the importance because this is such an important issue today, especially in our nation, civic engagement. People's voice being heard, people's voice matters. And we have to inspire and power people to give their voice and to not stand back. And I know both of you would agree that it is an America. It's Americans responsibility to be involved with the issues that matter in our nation and our country as we are living in extremely polarizing times right now in the political climate. And I want to ask you both your motivation for pursuing a public office. And what that is, how it's important to you, the value of that and what you believe you would bring to that process to make a difference. Both of you, but when you ran and that. You know, I go back to when I was a kid, when I was growing up here in Lakeland, I got involved in the first Earth Day, believe it or not. And I went to the mayor's office and made a presentation about how we needed to be able to do better with some of our lakes and some of the parks here. And they took it to heart. And I realized that going through the process, you can effectuate change. And then I realized that really that's the responsibility for all of us. And as in a nation that's founded on self-government that we and at an early age, I realized that you could have a difference with an individual initiative. And as I became older, I got more involved in politics. It became more crystal clear that that you impact lives. And there are fewer people starting to do this, which makes it more central that we have good people doing this. Scott, what about you as you've made this decision now to step in and to run for this seat? Well, I congressman Ross, I feel my whole life. I've been called in some way to serve. And for me, that first chapter was serving in the military. And it was the greatest privilege of my life. And it really afforded me the opportunity to experience our culture through the eyes of others around the world. And it really gave me appreciation for what all we're blessed with here. And you know, I always subscribe to the mantra, if not me, then who? Absolutely. And that's critically important. Yeah. And you have served this community well. You're currently a commissioner. And we're grateful for your leadership. Scott, I want to talk to you for a minute about your career leading into politics, which you have mentioned. You spent about 26 years, 26 years talking about in the United States Navy. During your 26 year career, you traveled all throughout the world serving faithfully. And when you retired from the Navy, you came home to start your own small business. Since you are no stranger to private enterprise, how has your political position been affected by your experiences as both a veteran, but also as a business owner? Well, I have always believed that conservative principles do the most over the long run to lift people up out of their conditions. And I've seen that in other countries. I've seen countries who are at different stages of implementing democracy. I've seen other countries that didn't have it at all. And I know that that's the right path for us. And I've just felt called to serve in that capacity here. Yeah. Why should other business, as a business owner, why should other business owners engage in the civic process? And what's the value of that? Well, it's interesting. When I go back to my decision to run for city commission, I would find myself sitting around with a lot of my peers complaining about things that we didn't like. And at the end, people would say, but who in the right mind would want to do that? And we all get busy doing our things and feel that someone else out there is going to be carrying the load. And that's not always the case. And when we start to see races go without a strong field of candidates to come in and try to compete for those, then I think that's a dangerous path. Yeah. And I actually I'd like to ask that question to you as well, Dennis. Why should business owners really jump into the process? Several reasons. One, if they want to have a good consumer base in which they can have good customers, they would want them to be engaged in the process. Businesses are absolutely connected to relationships. And one of the things that I've noticed is that those businesses that are more in tune to their community by building relationships, supporting programs, whether it be a nonprofit, whether it be a school, whether it be a hospital, those businesses do so much better. Not only in their bottom line, but just in the retention of employees and the pride that those employees take in that business because they know they partner with that community. Corporate citizenship is just as important as individual citizenship. But yeah, now the pandemic has really struck the small business community. There's no no doubt about it. In both of your opinions, what kind of legislation do we need right now to favor small business owners and help them grow and thrive past this, this pandemic? Well, as a lawyer, I will tell you one of the things that concerns me is going to be the threat of lawsuits for liability from contracting COVID. There would absolutely cripple a strong recovery in this economy. And I think until we know more about this virus, I think we have to focus on, of course, safety and welfare of each individual. But we also have to understand that the economic engines cannot be shut down and we need to be able to support and promote the wheels of commerce to start getting back together so that people can make a living and become productive again. It's going to be interesting to see what happens both in Congress and in our state legislature with new laws that are going to be proposed that that concern themselves with the impact of COVID. Yeah, let's go. Well, just to add to that, as we saw in the first waves of the COVID relief, a lot of small businesses, you know, those business owners are the ones opening the doors in the morning closing and doing the books. And there was a lot of a lot of detail to get through to understand how the programs work. So I've been pleased to see how we've ramped up our education efforts around how to get these, get the funds into the hands of the people that need a most because it's so small businesses that are the most vulnerable. And to follow up, Scott, talk to us a little bit about the city of Lakeland's approach to this pandemic, how we've, you know, how we have been working to protect our small business owners here in central Florida and in this community. Well, we've, we start with city staff, you know, the city of Lakeland is one of the largest employers, but because we have so many different facets to the city of Lakeland organization, taking care of our city staff in areas where they were not able to work with face to face with customers. We found places where we could get them realigned and and all, you know, thankfully, gainfully employed and just reaching out through communication programs working with the chamber and other different groups to try to promote the information that we could see coming down through the government, make sure it was getting into the right hands. Yeah. Before we take a first break here, Dennis, I want to talk to you about the ACPO, which you have brought amazing leadership to and we are your gift to this community, your gift to this university and to our students. You're working with up and coming college students that absolutely want to pursue positions in public office. They do have a passion to make a difference and they want to be solutions to the issues and the challenges that we're facing as you're teaching and navigating this education process, what is different about the upcoming generation of political science students that you're seeing that you're observing as you spend time with them? Well, probably the most impactful response I've seen is that once they're exposed to real life political leaders, they understand that they're no different than them and they have this passion now to want to become more like them and get involved in this process. When we took students to Washington DC, we sat with Secretary Carson, who is the Dr. Carson who heads up the HUD, Housing and Urban Development, and to see the response from they realize that this is a man who came out of abject poverty, with an illiterate mother who disciplined them and he becomes the chief of neurology or a pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, they also have these opportunities. And what I've seen is that they come into class because they want to be in class, but then all of a sudden they understand that politics permeates every aspect of life, every sector of every occupation and that they know that they can be those people that make that positive influence and they also know that we have to have those people. It's refreshing to see that. And Scott, as a father, I mean, you have seen this next generation think about the political arena and what they have focused on, how is your family now, have you discussed the political issues that are facing us in our country today? Well, they make for interesting conversations and we've had to establish some boundaries. Sure. It's very encouraging to see how engaged all of our young people are. They have a lot of concern about the direction things are headed, probably more so than when I was a kid coming along. And they do want to talk about the issues. They really do. And so to give them opportunity, as I know that we strive to do here at Southeastern, is important. They value that. In fact, actually a follow up, you mentioned boundaries because I think that's an important thing. What does it mean to establish boundaries? I think that is such an important aspect of building healthy conversation and dialogue today in our nation. I mean, yeah, we saw it front and center in a debate not too long ago. And you know, how do you talk to me about those banners? Because that's important. Well, it's cliche, but be able to disagree without being disagreeable. We've had to settle on that and define that for ourselves individually. But I think so much of it really comes down to our kids seeing what we model to them. And unfortunately, they are very frustrated to see just the level of just bitter parts and chip among adults that frankly don't act like adults a lot of times. So I think we need to be modeling better as the role models for our younger people. Yeah, so good. Well, we're going to take a quick commercial break. We will be right back after a word from our sponsors. If you're a driven professional striving to expand your leadership and pack change at any level of your organization, southeastern universities online masters degree in leadership is definitely for you. This program provides you the opportunity to learn in the context of entrepreneurship, nonprofit leadership, research or organizational leadership. You can apply today at scu.edu slash apply. That's su.edu slash apply. Dennis and Scott, I know you both are men of faith. And in today's political arena, it seems at times that there is no moral compass for navigating government and power. I know you both are men of integrity that lead from a place of deep conviction. How is your faith influenced your way of thinking in terms of the politics that you engage in and in terms of the decisions that have to be made for this nation? How does that faith inform you? Well, if I might, you know, one of the things that I've struggled with for a long time is the building of my faith because I realize that faith is just not something that you achieve one day and it's always there. It's something you have to work at. And it's something that as you work at it, you become stronger at it. It's like exercise. It's a discipline. And I've enjoyed building my faith. I've enjoyed extending my relationships and learning more about other people's faith, how it's impacted their lives and help them overcome obstacles. And when they're down and when they're up to keep them in balance, you know, my faith has been probably one of the best things for me when it comes time to having to make decisions, especially as an elected official. Because I know that I'm never going to please everybody and that's okay. What I have to know is that I'm doing what has been foundational in my beliefs. When we talk about a moral compass, we have to also understand that, you know, you've got a world out there that seems to get further and further from Judeo-Christian values and become more secular. And yet our founders were very faith-based. And they were so faith-based that they wanted to preserve everybody's right to practice their own faith. And for me, my faith has been the foundation upon which I've made some decisions that I found to be very difficult. But our time here is temporary anyway. And to know that you're doing something that you firmly believe in, although it's difficult, I might not be able to make it right, but I know that I can do the right thing. And that has been probably the best thing about my faith. That's good. My faith is clearly my azimuth. And I try to remind myself daily any time before we're going into any sort of political arena, whether it's a commission meeting or these campaign type events that I remember who I am. And that any decisions that we make or I'm a part of will be pleasing to God when it's all over with. And I kind of have a little mantra that I go through and it's breath deep. Yeah, assume positive intent and extend more grace than you expect in return. And I feel if we could go through a lot of our meetings with that sort of philosophy, we get more done. That would be great. Have you ever found either one of you? Have you ever found yourself caught between a rock in a hard place because of faith and how did you navigate that? Has there been any moment at all during your tenure in public service? In some issues that I've taken on that I've had to be involved in whether it be dealing with right to life and limitations there. Those that were a more purest and then their opinions would say this isn't good enough, but it's better than what we have. And you have to wrestle with that is better than what we have good. Yes, you know, we've got to keep moving the ball forward and while you can't get everything you want, which is one of the most difficult things about being in the political world because you do have to compromise, you have to reach consensus. As long as you're getting closer to where you know you need to be as an individual and as a nation, I think you're doing the right things. And while those are difficult decisions, it does give you some solace to know that you're advancing what you believe to be your Christian cause and values. Yeah, that's good. Well, I do struggle with some of those issues as well. And there are places that with my own faith are non-negotiable, but also recognizes as a government servant, I'm still bound by whether it's the Constitution or the laws that we have and we can try to fight for change, but it's chipping away a bit at the time. Yeah, Scott, you're running for election to the US House, you know, Florida's 15th congressional district. This is the same congressional district that former Congressman Ross served in as you're approaching this election, which is going to happen here pretty soon November 3rd. What are some of the issues that you think we need to really focus on, take care of? What do you want to fight for as you potentially step into this public office? What will be the priority? Well, first priority, and it wouldn't have been on my radar screen at the beginning of the years, getting our country back to work. None of us anticipated being in the midst of the best economy we'd ever had as a country to be where we are, but we're making progress on that. So that's first and foremost. Next would be, gosh, there's a number of different areas. We've got to solve some very difficult problems that we need to figure out a way to put the political football aside and fix health care. We need to address immigration issues. We need to attack our spending. You know, we've added to our debt this year in ways that will come home to roost whether it's for my kids or grandkids. At some point, we're going to have to pay the piper. And then we have some some of our safety net programs that really need some fundamental corrections to them if they're going to be sustainable for the long run. But it's just very hard to get in that arena and get people to take their party persuasions off and settle down and fix problems. In your opinion, what what will be the biggest challenge to create solutions to these issues and priorities that that are going to be important? Well, it'd be easier. I can I can make assumptions, but I know it would come better from one who's been there. I just think trying to get through the partisan divide. And that's why I as a veteran, I'm encouraged to see a lot more veterans being led to to seek higher office. I know right now we've got the biggest slate of veteran candidates from both the Republican and the Democrat side and generations. And we need that. I think you know, we have the lowest number of veterans serving in Congress ever. And there's a lot of dissatisfaction from the public. So hopefully that that ability to work together as we learned in the military will help us there in Congress. And Dennis, I want to ask you, how do we get through that? I mean, you're doing a, and by the way, also a part of the SCU podcast network, you're doing a brand new podcast that's going to be airing here soon. And I mean, you've worked behind the scenes. What does it take to truly break through and reach across the aisle and truly have consensus? There's a biblical principle. Let us come and reason together so that we can make the right decisions that will benefit everybody. How do you really do that? You can build relationships. You find out that the person that is abjectly against you philosophically and politically is just like you as an individual. They want the same things for their family. They want to see a greater nation. And you find that there's commonality in your passions. Yet there's a different direction by which you want to achieve those goals. One of the things we're doing at the ACPL and one of the things I'd love to see us do as a nation is learn how to effectuate good conversation that's controversial, but yet respectful. I know that I've got about as much chance changing one of my liberal friends' mind as they do me. But that doesn't mean I can't become good friends with them. On our podcast that we're going to be doing, I've got some dear friends that are way across the aisle for me politically but have become very close to me as good good friends. And I think one of the things once you leave the process, you look back and say, goodness, why didn't I reach out more often? Why didn't I understand that in order to build a good piece of legislation that it couldn't be all one sided? That no one party has a monopoly on all the ideas. The good ideas come from both sides. And that only happens if you build those relationships. Yeah, Rich. As we close our time together, a couple of questions. There are some citizens in our country that choose not to exercise their right to vote. They say that their vote actually is not going to make a difference. So why should I go out there and do that? What would your response be to these citizens who are choosing just to sit back on the side of the road? Just to sit back on the side line because they don't think it's really going to count. If I might address that first of all, first of all, not to vote is as impactful as voting because you're empowering one of the other two candidates by not voting. Second of all, I think you're doing a total disservice to your citizenship, which requires you to be actively engaged in this process. You may be disgusted with the people, but the only way you're going to change that is by asserting your right to vote so that as a consumer, you will change the product that you want to see that will accommodate you. The more we get involved, the more we vote, the better we mold the candidates we want to see and have the leadership that's necessary to effectuate the positive change that we want to see in this nation. It pains me to see that people sit at home and make up every excuse about not wanting to vote. It's one of the most fundamental rights. It's the only right that we have to exercise that can absolutely, if not exercise, take away all the other rights. That's why we've got to make sure that we don't lose our right that we continue to exercise that right to vote. It's our fundamental right. I mean, they're really all other rights we have as Americans start there. There's no room to complain if we don't participate. Somewhere out across this country, there will be races that will be decided by such slim margins that the people who sat back and didn't vote would have made the difference. We're about to hit probably the most divisive election we've ever had. Or in quite some time, what do you think the catalyst will be no matter the outcome to bring healing to this nation? Well, it has to start with each individual knowing that they are the agents of change to make this nation better than it was. Otherwise, it will be a cataclysmic event that brings us together and I don't want to see that happen. Whether it be another 9-11 or whether it be a natural disaster, whether it be an economic collapse, those types of things bring us together involuntarily. But if we were to open our eyes and see that we can be those agents of change, that it's not about partisanship, but it's about patriotism, it's about being part of a nation that has a history unlike any known to mankind. And the potential out there for continued success and sustainability is amazing, but it has to be each one of us. It's the same way of having faith, it's a discipline that you exercise every day of your life and eventually we get there. Yeah, I agree. When we look back through our nation's history, the times that we've come together, the greatest have been the times following the greatest calamities. And I think initiatives like South Eastern Zoo and here with this school, getting civics back into the classroom, making people understand teaching that because sadly, a lot of people just don't have that fundamental knowledge. Yeah. And that's what we're striving to do. Make it evident how important their participation is. Absolutely. Dennis served in the seat that you are vying for for eight years. Dennis, any parting advice to Scott as he heads into the closing weeks of this? Well, let me preface my comments by saying I'm glad I'm not running against him. And let me just talk because I want to make this clear at the ACPL, we try not to dabble in policy, we look at process. And one of the things we focus on on process is what would you want in the qualities of your leader? What would you want in a person who would exemplify those characteristics of statesmanship? And I can tell you that Scott does that. I won't address any of his policies that's for him to do in his campaign, but as an individual who has shown the qualities of leadership, not just in his campaign, but also as a father, as a businessman, as a patriot veteran of the United States Navy. Those are the qualities we need to see in people. And I don't care if they're left, right or in the middle. That's what we want to see. And so I just encourage you to continue the track you're on. I think that it will benefit not only you, but a very good nation. Well, thank you. Scott and Dennis, I want to thank you both for joining me today on the Framework Leadership Podcast. I'm thankful for the insight that you bring our community, a tremendous value. And the way that we need to be involved in civics is so important. For all of our listeners, I hope that you leave this conversation today with a desire to be involved and make a difference in the things going on in our nation, whether you believe it or not, the people that we elect into public office actually make a difference in this nation. Do some research, go out to the polls on November 3rd to make your voice heard. We will see you next time on Framework Leadership.",

        "transcript": " It's my great pleasure tonight to introduce, you know, we hear the word Patriot thrown around a lot. The words have ceased to have meaning, especially in Washington. You know, everybody's a hero now. When I was growing up, a hero was a sandwich. And, you know, a real hero was something else. But the person you're about to hear from tonight is a hero in the classical sense. Brian Mass served our country for 12 years as a soldier in the United States Army, including the Elite Joint Special Operations Command, yes. He was a bomb disposal expert. And while on his 2010 deployment in Afghanistan, Brian was tasked with protecting his brothers from IEDs. While he was able to detect and destroy most of these IEDs, the very last IED caused him catastrophic injuries, including the loss of both legs. As a result of his service in sacrifice for our country, Brian Mass was awarded medals for Valor, Merit, and Sacrifice, including the Bronze Star, the Army Commandation Medal for Valor, the Purple Heart, and the Defense Maritory of Service Medal. He retired his staff sergeant. Throughout his life, Brian Mass has been a staunch supporter of the State of Israel. During Israel's war with Hamas in the summer of 2014, Brian witnessed a number of disturbing anti-Israel demonstrations in Boston and at Harvard, where he was a full-time student, and decided he needed to help Israel in a tangible way. Brian took the time to go to Israel and volunteer with the Israel Defense Forces. In January of 2015, Brian now lives in southern Florida with his wife and three children. It's always a pleasure to welcome someone from Florida to Washington because, as I like to say, they're coming from one Mickey Mouse operation to another. He's running for Congress as if he hasn't achieved enough things. Brian, there is counseling available for that. I want you to know. It's the 18th District, and I hope you'll support him and welcome him to the platform now, Brian Mass. Thank you. I couldn't be more honored to be here with you and to have the opportunity to speak about truth because that's what this night is all about and the fact of the matter is. Right now, the world is attempting to sell whoever they can, the lie that somehow the most peaceful country in the entire Middle East Israel is responsible for somehow preventing peace in the Middle East. That is a complete lie, and this is something that I learned in the most amazing way as I had the opportunity to go and serve along the side the soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces. While I was serving there, I had the opportunity each and every weekend to be hosted by different families for Shabbat dinner. As I went to the home of each of these families, I realized something very important at each one of them. Every single one of these families was waiting for a son or a daughter or a grandson or a granddaughter to return home from their military duty in order to begin the festivities of Shabbat, the dinner of Shabbat. This struck a chord in my mind, and I started to think about this. As here in the United States, I had served 12 years, and I was very familiar with the fact that it wasn't the job of every son and daughter in the United States to serve, but it was the job in Israel for every son and daughter to Donny Uniform and serve in defense of the state of Israel. And I learned from that as I am a father of three, and as much as I hope my kids one day enter service in the military, that I know there's no easier way to break me down as a parent than to think about losing one of my children. And that's the reality for every single parent and every single grandparent across Israel, that at one point in the life of their children, they will probably have to Donny Uniform and fire a weapon in defense of Israel. And it's for that reason that I know every single family across Israel truly desires nothing more than peace with every single one of their neighbors, Libya, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, whatever neighbor you want to pick throughout the Middle East, they want nothing more than peace because they want their children to grow, and they want their children to go to school, and they want their children to start families, and they want their children to travel, and they want their children to have a life. They don't want their children to have to go and fire a rifle in defense against lies that are being perpetuated. And this was the lesson that I learned. And I could tell you I learned this as well. I learned to compare and contrast our two militaries, but more so to parallel the service that exists between our two militaries and something that I couldn't be more proud to tell you about. I can tell you that the way that we fight and the commitment that we have to fight for the things that are important to us, they couldn't parallel each other more. Those ideologies between the United States of America and Israel, we fight for freedom and we fight for democracy and we fight for human rights for all people. And when we're out there fighting for these things, we do it with a very specific willingness. It's the willingness to have snipers target us and have bombs dropped on us and to walk across landmines or improvised explosive devices. We do it while we carry letters in our front pocket, which we promise to deliver to our best friends' families, our best friends' loved ones, should anything ever happen to them while we're out defending our two great countries. That is the commitment and the way in which we go out and we defend every single thing that we fight for and that we determine that we will represent to the entire world regardless of the challenge that it presents to us to represent these ideologies to the entire world. That is our commitment to represent these ideologies regardless of the cost to ourselves as individuals, regardless of the cost that it takes on our countries. And it's in that that I know that they're truly selfless individuals and I couldn't be more proud to say that I served alongside both the defenders of Israel and the defenders of the United States of America. I don't speak a great deal of Hebrew. I picked up a few words while I was in Israel. Most of them, I could say in polite company, a couple of them. Not. But the most important word that I learned is this. I hope I do it justice to saying and it's the word ahim or brothers. And it's the most important word that I learned because I learned truly that we are brothers. That is the truth. The United States of America and Israel are brothers in what we represent to the world and the way that we'll fight for them. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Hi, I'm Richard Gumenthal, your United States Senator, proud and excited to celebrate the classes of 2022. And sorry, I can't be with you in person because I'm here working for you. Congratulations on reaching this memorable milestone. I want to express my gratitude to President Elsa Nunez and the entire Eastern staff for your professional skill and dedication. And to all of your wonderful teachers, the accomplished faculty, who have been on the front lines. And of course your parents and loved ones who have been by your side. I want to give special thanks to all of the veterans here today. You are among Connecticut's heroes. I've been honored to speak at Eastern's recent commencements during this time of hardship and heartbreak. But this moment is one of renewed hope and resolve as we emerge from the pandemic. I deeply admired your courage and perseverance during these challenging times. And you now have a diploma and a labor market that offers a lot of opportunities. Americans have confronted huge challenges in recent years. A continuing pandemic and economic downturn, the opioid crisis, mental health struggles, especially for young people, the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Also, personal or individual challenges and tragedies, job loss, family members, sickness or passing. Americans have always faced down these challenges. But never alone, there are always helping hands. As I travel around Connecticut, which I do every week when I come home, I am impressed by the resilience and resolve of our people and their generous spirit. In fact, the best part of my job is to provide a helping hand to individual people, a worker who needs job training, a veteran who deserves health services. Or benefits, a family facing eviction. They knew to ask for a helping hand. And so should you. I never back down from a fight, nor should you. I recently was honored to help lead the fight to confirm the first black woman, Katangi Brown Jackson, to be a justice on the United States Supreme Court. She is superbly qualified with superlative intellect and character. But she emphasized to me when I met her how she overcame obstacles and stood on the shoulders of others, role models, and mentors who blazed trails for her, even as now she is a trailblazer for others. Each of you has the same opportunity to lead by example and become a role model and mentor for new leaders. And to be a helping hand, we need you. Every American generation makes a compact with the next one. To lead the country better for Americans to come. You are part of that compact. So I hope you will deserveily celebrate today and work hard to make tomorrow better, not just for yourselves, but for everyone. Thank you and congratulations.",

        "transcript": " Thank you all. Thank you all for that great welcome. Thanks to you, we've won a great victory tonight here in the Fourth District of Arkansas. It's a victory we all hope for. We are a little larger than we expected. There's a lot of races left around the country tonight whose fates we don't yet know. But here in Arkansas tonight we obstruct a blow for the spirit of 1776, the spirit of liberty. It is alive and well in 2012. We've got this campaign from the very beginning has been about more than what our government spins. More than what we pay in taxes as important as those things are. The campaign has been about the future of self-government in America, about returning our government to its constitutional roots, about reasserting our natural God-given rights, and reviving the spirit of free enterprise in America. As I did in the US Army once before tonight, I give you my solemn oath that in Congress I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the spirit of our beloved republic. That oath is a great privilege and humbling honor for me. It brings to mind the debt of gratitude we owe to all those who came before us in America, as well as the debts that I owe to so many in this room, to all of you for your hard work over the last 15 months, to my campaign team who when we started this race had as much political experiences I did. None. To my mom and my dad for their love and guidance growing up on our small farm in Yale County, we always did what was right for my sister, Sarah and me, although not necessarily what we thought was right, but to my sister as well for her support and her friendship. Finally, I'm grateful above all to the people of Arkansas who have bestowed on me a great honor and given me a great trust. Whether you voted for me tonight or night, I look forward to serving you in the United States Congress. This district is used to sending Democrats to Washington. Now we will send a Republican. But just as sure as Grant County, Arkansas, is named after another ex-soldier who went to Washington as a Republican, so too you can be sure that whatever your party, I will serve you equally and faithfully in the United States Congress. Our fellow citizens today all across America for the 113th time have cast their ballots under our Constitution. This simple and majestic act brings home the central truth of our republic that we're all created equal in God's eyes and that we should be under the law in too many places around the world today that is still not the case. But here in America, it doesn't matter who your parents are or who their parents were, what you do or where you're from. All that matters is that you believe in that founding principle and you're an American at heart. You can find opportunity here to fulfill your dreams, to build a better life for yourself and for your family. Too often politicians in both parties have lost faith in that founding principle. They misuse the power of government to aid the politically connected and the privileged. They raise up artificial distinctions among citizens where none should exist. Or they grant preferences and favors to flawed ideas. Because when politicians try to pick winners, they almost always pick losers. The best ideas don't need the aid of government to win in a free economy. And when all that happens, we're left with the bill. Less opportunity, less prosperity, less liberty. More important though, the next generation who are as much a part of America as we are as our forefathers are, are left with the bill. There's no justice in that. Abraham Lincoln explained long ago that it's the same struggle between right and wrong that we've seen since the beginning of time. The same old serpent that says, you work and I eat. Let us today rededicate ourselves to the spirit of the Constitution that says we will secure the blessings of liberty, not only for ourselves, but also, and especially for the next generation. 11 generations of Americans before us have done that for us. We owe them and the next generation nothing less. I'm mindful tonight though that we would have nothing to pass on to the next generation that wasn't for the courage and the sacrifice of our men and women and the armed forces. They stand guard tonight in Afghanistan and all around the world, just as they have since Lexington and Concord. From the men at men who toppled the modest empire in the world to the volunteers who held the union together, so their errors, like my dad and his dad, could save the world from Nazi and Soviet tyranny to the 9-11 generation today, we owe them all a debt of gratitude to great to ever repay. But we can begin to repay it if we follow their example in Washington. Shortly after I began this campaign, an elderly woman came up to me and she said, you were in the army right and I said, yeah, I was. And she said, now you're running for Congress. And I said, yes, ma'am, I am. And she said, well, why would you want to leave the country's most respected institution for the country's least respected institution? And lately it's a sad fact that our political institutions have lost respect of our fellow citizens. Our troops, on the other hand, are respected not only for what they do, fight and win our nation's wars, but also for who they are, the character that they display. If our political leaders demonstrated some of the same virtues, like integrity and honor and courage, our political institutions will regain that lost respect. As it is, one of the most common questions I got asked on the campaign was, well, Washington changed you. I don't think they meant that in a good way. Perhaps change has developed a bad taste after four years of Barack Obama. But too often, those who we send to Washington do change there and not in a way that General Washington would have proved of. Seven years ago today, I reported to the U.S. Army Ranger School. Every day at that school, we were cited the Ranger Creed to remind us of the high standards set for us. I remember the lessons of that Creed very well. I will take those lessons with me to Washington in hopes of changing that town, not being changed by it. I volunteered, knowing full well, the hazards of my chosen profession. I will set the example for others to follow. I will, my country expects more of me. I will shoulder more than my share of the task, whatever it may be. And I will fight on to the Ranger objective and complete the mission, though I be the lone survivor. And what is our mission today? Every soldier knows is to pass on what we have been given and better shape than we found it. And what have we been given? A country that has brought more prosperity and more liberty to more people than any other in the history of the world. That country was born from the sacrifice of our forefathers who knew that government should be limited, that it should treat its citizens as equals, and it should protect a private sphere of economic freedom and religious liberty. Those are the principles that will guide me in Congress, and those are the principles that will restore America's greatness. No doubt we have had a lot of challenges recently. And I cannot promise that we are going to overcome those challenges in the next year or even the next Congress, because they have been building for many ways for decades. Nor cannot promise that you will always agree with my votes, because what I owe each of you is my judgment, my conscience, and my unbiased opinion. But I do promise that together we will complete the mission, we will overcome these challenges, we will build a better future, and we will pass on a legacy of liberty that is greater still than the one that we inherited. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you for your support. God bless you, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Arginette Arms announces the presence in the Chamber of the Honorable Maisie Herono from Hawaii, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. She is escorted by retired Major General Gus Hargit, the President of the National Guard Association of the United States, and Major General Arthur J. Logan, the Agedent General of Hawaii. With its Arginette Arms, please escort a distinguished guest and her party to the platform. It's now time to present our Nogas Montgomery Medal. It's our association's second highest honor. The Nogas Board of Directors bestows this award for outstanding support of our association's objectives by an individual organization. General Hanson, will you please read the citation? Senator Herono distinguished herself by exceptionally meritorious service as a United States senator and Congresswoman from the State of Hawaii. Senator Herono has dedicated over three decades of public service, remaining a constant and avid supporter of the Guard by supporting legislation and wide ranging initiatives. These initiatives will continue to have direct and positive impacts for the soldiers and airmen of the National Guard for many years to come. Senator the podium is yours. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Aloha to all of you. It's a privilege to be here with you all. And General Hanson, thank you for your introduction and it's great to see so many people from Hawaii who will understand our city to my right. There you go. You've paid your dues. You're sitting here. I know all about that part. And of course, General Joe Logan, our Agenda General of our National Guard, General Logan, Mahalo Noiloa for your commitment and the work that you do on behalf of the people of the State of Hawaii. It is an honor to stand alongside all of you to receive this award. And I was in the back listening to my colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham. And I know he said that he would like to find a Democrat who he can work with. There are actually a number of us that he can work with to eliminate sequester. And so I will be there talking with them about how we can do this. I have had the pleasure of working with Nagas throughout my time in public service. And I was reminded how long that has been time flies over 30 years in elected office. And it has been a privilege. I consider the, and consider General Haggad, by the way, this is your last formal convention as President of Nagas. Thank you for all that you've done for this organization. And for the many times that you have been to Hawaii to work with us. So General, you are part of our O'Hana. In Hawaii, we consider our extended family to be part of our O'Hana. And all of you are very much a part of my O'Hana. I'm grateful to the warmth and support that you've provided me over the years. And it's a privilege to continue working with all of you. I'm honored that you've chosen to recognize my past work. But you know what, my work with you and for you will always continue with the Montgomery Medal. I'm very grateful. But today should be about more than receiving an award. It should be a call to action and a reminder that our work is never truly complete. And as Senator Graham said, you know what, one of the first things we do need to address is the issue of sequester. By the way, I serve with Senator Graham on the Armed Services Committee, as you know. And it's always fun when he comes and starts to ask his questions in a highly, whatever we call a lorially way so that whoever he is grilling, I assure you've watched him. By the end of the series of questions that Senator Graham asked, the person who's testifying is basically stuck. But I really enjoy how he goes about it. And he and I have worked on a number of issues, including as he was leaving and I extended my allow to him. He said, ego vision. Those of you in Hawaii, you know what, ego vision is. He and I worked together to make sure that program stayed in Hawaii. So today is particularly meaningful as we prepare to celebrate the life of my friend, Congressman Mark DeKai, one of you. And there will be a memorial for him at the State Capitol next week. And three years ago, Mark stood at my side as I addressed this conference in Hawaii. Losing Mark is such a young age. Has been a tremendous loss to his family, to the state of Hawaii, and to the guard community. Mark's memorial service took place in Honolulu last month. And it was very meaningful, of course. And this was at the State Capitol. And as we all finished singing the song over the rainbow, there was at that moment, at that very moment, because it was a kind of a overcast day. And at that moment when the song was sung, the sun shown very, very brightly on a very large picture of Mark that was placed at the service. And his face was glowing because it really was how he viewed his service with the guard and to the state of Hawaii. He had such a joy in what he was doing. And then later that day, a rainbow appeared over Pearl City, his hometown that he represented for decades in the state legislature. And we in Hawaii, we call those moments, chicken skin moments, where you get goose bumps. Where there's sometimes a larger meaning and inexplicable events occur, such as that sun, just breaking through the clouds and shining on his face right at that moment. And for the rainbow to be over the community that he served for so long and he loves so well. So Mark was proud to serve with you. And he continued his flight, for military families throughout his time in public service. And I particularly worked closely with him when I was in the US House of Representatives and he was with the guard. He made sure that impact date for Hawaii as well as to all of our states remained strong and in place. So in the two months since he has passed away, we've heard a lot of tributes to Mark. But the ultimate tribute to him, of course, is that we continue the work that he began in memory of Mark. Mark was so passionate. Thank you. I worked with Mark for decades when I was a tenant governor of the state of Hawaii and he was still in the state legislature and I used to refer to him as my younger brother. Although he didn't necessarily take directions from older sister that well, but we worked really closely on so many things. He was so passionate about his service to the National Guard and his work with Nogas. And he was really proud to have been instrumental in bringing this convention to Hawaii in 2013. Hawaii has hosted this conference more times than any other state. Really proud of that. And as an island state, we have a special appreciation for the National Guard's mission. As the only island state, the National Guard serves as one of our most important first responders in times of need in our state. And our National Guard answered the call for the residents of Kauai back when Hurricane Iniki hit and was devastating to that island and more recently to Hawaii island during a tropical storm as well. And you responded to outbreaks of disease and two devastating lava flows. I think only in Hawaii do we have lava flows. But that's yet another mission that the National Guard in Hawaii helps us with. And your mission extends far beyond deployments and responding to natural disasters. One of the programs that I so much support and which extends your mission is your commitment to our young people. The National Guard's Youth Challenge program has changed the lives of thousands of young people across our country. And as a strong early supporter of Hawaii's Youth Challenge program, I attended the first graduation, Youth Challenge graduation in Hawaii with then Agitent General Richardson in 1994. This was a very different kind of graduation. As you can imagine, those of us in office go to a lot of graduations, but this Youth Challenge graduation was particularly memorable. Coming to the graduates, tell their stories and the challenges that they have faced in their lives and the overcoming of so many obstacles to join Youth Challenge and to successfully graduate, there was not a dry eye in the house. And I can tell you, General Richardson, me, all of us who were speaking that day, we were profoundly moved because we knew that this program had changed the lives of these young people who faced so many challenges in their young lives and continued to face those challenges. I have attended other Youth Challenge graduations over the years and each one is memorable because of the young people and their achievements. I know that your Youth Challenge participated in this convention. I'm sorry that I mis-sempa please extend my aloha to all of your young people who are in Youth Challenge programs and so many of your states. I believe in the transformational aspects of this program and I will continue to support it. Over the years, I've been proud to work alongside you in a number of fights important to the guard and to the guard families. And that's why I've been proud to leave the efforts in Congress to help guardsmen and women who face unique challenges reintegrating into society after deployments overseas. In particular, I've worked hard to make it easier to access veterans benefits, including of course healthcare benefits, and to make it easier for returning service members to attend and pay for college. It's clear we have a lot more work ahead of us, particularly in the fight to improve healthcare for our veterans. And throughout this fight, I've thought about guard members like Elisa Smithers from Kapolei, which is a community in Hawaii, who shared her story as part of a center of veterans affair field hearing that I held in Hawaii two years ago. Elisa was deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2006, where she was attached to Hawaii's famed 142nd Infantry Battalion. Elisa returned from deployment with physical injuries as PTSD, but her battle for care was only just beginning. Elisa received care for her physical injuries, but no one at the VA at that time followed up with her about her PTSD. She did everything right. She reported her injuries. She called the hotlines. She waited at the Hawaii VA for hours, but unfortunately, and sadly, she didn't receive the support and the treatment that she deserved and earned. Elisa suffered for months more, sleeping in her closet, and even lashing out against her daughter because she thought she was back in combat being attacked. She knew something needed to change and paid for appointments out of her own pocket with a civilian psychologist. And by chance, months later, at a yellow ribbon ceremony, Elisa ran into someone from the Oahu Vet Center who agreed to see her the very next day. And Elisa said, the visits to a civilian psychologist and the vet center saved my life. I am truly convinced that I would have committed suicide or hurt my children if I did not seek help on my own. We failed Elisa and others like her for far too long. And while there have been improvements to the system, I will continue to fight every single day to make sure that all of our veterans receive the timely, compassionate care and treatment that you have all earned. 15 years ago, today, September 11, 2001, on a morning very much like this one, our world changed. Our nation looked to brave people, including so many of you, to confront the new challenges that attack presented. And yes, our world is, I would say even more dangerous. I also serve on the Intelligence Committee. So I learned a lot about the dangers facing our country from a resurgent Russia to North Korean provocations, China's activities in the South China seas, cyber attacks to more devastating natural disasters. The National Guard, you, will continue to be at the forefront to keep all of us safe. And I will continue to work side by side with you, myohana, to make sure the Guard has a support and resources you need to be. Join me. Always ready. Always there. Mahalo, Nui, Loa, to each and every one of you and your families for your outstanding service to our country and to our states. Aloha. Senator Hoorah, thank you very much for taking time for us today and traveling this distance to receive this award. Thank you so much. With the Sergeant Arms, please escort her to distinguish guests and her party from the platform. Okay. Are we going? I think we're going to see that. Aloha. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. I'm happy to see you. Yes, sir. Excuse me, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you. Aloha. Thank you. Thank you. Aloha. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "transcript": " Senator from Hawaii. Mr. President, the Senate has a constitutional duty equal to the presidents to provide advice and consent on all judicial nominees, including, of course, the president's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Our advice and consent role requires us to review the totality of Judge Kavanaugh's record and experiences, including the documents from his time in the executive branch. Judge Kavanaugh worked as a fellow in the first Bush administration's office of the solicitor general for Ken Star in the office of the Independent Council, investigating President Clinton and in President George W. Bush's White House in the office of White House Council, and as staff secretary to the president. As has been the practice for previous Supreme Court nominees, the Judiciary Committee should ask for and receive all records related to his work in these roles. Any document request to the Bush Library or to the National Archives should parallel similar requests made for other Supreme Court nominees. Take the request sent by the committee for Elena Kagan's nomination. This is the letter requesting information for Elena Kagan. We simply substituted Judge Kavanaugh's name where Elena Kagan's name appeared. Note, well, you probably can't see it, but the letter request is signed by then chair of the Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy, and it was signed by the ranking member, our current Attorney General, the ranking member at that time, Jeff Sessions. On May 18, 2010, just eight days after her nomination to the Supreme Court by President Obama, the Judiciary Committee sent a bipartisan request to the Director of the Clinton Presidential Library asking for records from her time working at the White House and records related to her nomination to the DC Circuit. We should send a similar request for Judge Kavanaugh, just as I said, substituting Greg Kavanaugh's name for Elena Kagan's. However, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, our colleague from Iowa, is refusing to work with us to request the totality of Judge Kavanaugh's record. I have heard objection to the request for all the records rest on the volume of documents we might receive. The fact that there could be a lot of documents relevant to Judge Kavanaugh's time in the White House or any relevant point in his career is not the issue. The President knew there were a lot of documents related to Judge Kavanaugh. It was reported that the majority leader argued that Judge Kavanaugh's voluminous record could hurt his confirmation, tacitly acknowledging that the Senate would have to examine all of the documents. Senator McConnell understood that the record was relevant to the Senate's advice and consent responsibility in reviewing this nominee's qualifications and judicial philosophy. And even the nominee himself, Judge Kavanaugh thinks the same. Judge Kavanaugh often refers to how his executive branch experiences shaped his judicial philosophy. In 2013, he wrote in a published Law Review article that, I quote, when people ask me what prior legal experience has been most useful for me as a judge. I tell them I certainly drawn all of them, the clerkships, private practice at Kirkland, independent counsel's office, even college jobs on the hill at Ways and Means, but the five and a half years in the White House, especially the three years as staff secretary for President Bush, are among the most interesting and most instructive. End quote. In 2016, he repeated that sediment almost word for word. Again, quoting Judge Kavanaugh. People sometimes ask what prior legal experience has been most useful for me as a judge. And I say I certainly draw on all of them, but I also say that my five and a half years at the White House, and especially my three years as staff secretary for President George W Bush, were the most interesting and informative for me. End quote. Judge Kavanaugh emphasized that the most interesting and informative experiences he had were at the White House as staff secretary. So of course, the Senate Judiciary Committee ought to be able to review all of the records of his time in the White House. The scope of the request that Democrats and the Judiciary Committee are proposing is so obvious and common sense, that it is hard to believe it is the topic of debate. In normal times, there would not be any question about what the committee is entitled to see and no responsible senator would object. But these are not normal times. In these times, we have senators trying to cover for an irresponsible, dangerous president who, like in anything else he does, wants to bulldoze his nominees way onto the highest court in the land for life. In these not normal times, the simplest of processes, getting access to the records of a Supreme Court nominee, has become politicized. And in these not normal times, we have to wonder why the standards have suddenly changed and we have to ask ourselves, what could possibly be hiding in those documents? When the president proposes a nominee to the Supreme Court, we owe it to ourselves and to our country to thoroughly examine that nominees record, diligently question them about their records and judicial philosophy and make a reasoned judgment about their fitness for the job. The American people rely on us in the Senate and particularly in the Judiciary Committee to perform our constitutional advice and consent duties to the best of our abilities. So I urge my Republican colleagues to join us in calling for the full release of all documents related to Judge Kavanaugh's record and experiences. This has happened in the past, it has always happened and it should happen again. Mr. President, I yield the floor.",

Yeah, I'm actually circled it because I didn't know what it meant. Mr. Kennedy, do you want a dictionary? That's what people do when they don't know what a word means. They look it up in a dictionary. I never showed up unprepared for Professor Elizabeth Warren ever again. She was the toughest teacher on campus, but the weight list for her class was a mile long. She pushed us hard, she brought out our best, she believed in us, and she believed in the law, not as an abstraction, but as a living force with the power to make life better or worse. She taught us that it's impacts late, not in classrooms or textbooks, but in a society where wages have not budged in 40 years. We're two and a half million children are homeless, where we can expect one and three black men to go to prison. Our laws have human consequences. That fact fueled law school professor to take on this country's most entrenched financial interest. She brought a middle class champion back to a Massachusetts Senate seat, and it led a first term US Senator to become our government's gut check. In a sea of power and privilege, Senator Warren is an anchor for the voiceless and victimized. She asks more from all of us because she believes deeply in each of us. That faith in our country and the American people is the very foundation of our Democratic Party. It echoes through this arena tonight, and through every classroom, living room, and hearing room that Senator Elizabeth Warren has ever touched. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to introduce to you your Senator, my Senator, our Senator, Elizabeth Warren.",
