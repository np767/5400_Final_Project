        "transcript": "uh Kentucky had the unfortunate distinction until yesterday of being the only state in the South with a democratic legislative body that changed dramatically yesterday as the Republicans in the Bluegrass State took the state house by defeating 17 Democrats went from 47 up to 64 um it' been almost as long as the uh it had been since the cub has won the World Series 95 years of continuous uh Democratic control so that only added a little more um happiness to my uh evening uh to more current and National matters I Senor Schumer call yesterday and um offered his cooperation and I said that's certainly what I intended to do and we talked again today and that's still the view of both of us that we want to work together and see what we can accomplish uh for the American people not only in the uh in the lame duck but beginning next year also have had a chance to talk to president the vice president both of whom called uh to president-elect Trump and to Vice president-elect Pence uh all today um not only just offering congratulations where appropriate but in the case of the president talk about wrapping up uh business uh this year I'm really proud of the races that we won um if you look across the country U as all of you know we had a lot of exposure 24 of us up only 10 of our Democrat friends um in a day when the American people clearly were expressing themselves for major change uh in the vote for president it's noteworthy that only one or maybe two Senate incumbants were defeated so I think an appropriate way to look at the Senate races 18 of the Senate candidates actually ran ahead of the uh presidential uh candidate in other races somewhat behind kind of a mixed picture uh but I think in a day when people were voting for change they didn't decide they wanted to change the Republican Senate which I'm proud of and of course many of our members actually had bipartisan accomplishments to run on as distinguished for example from the previous Congress where senator beage from Alaska had never been able to allow and never had been allowed to even offer an amendment on a on a bill in a whole six-year term we open the Senate up we gave people an opportunity to express themselves to offer their ideas in the case of several of our members there were important accomplishments for their states that they were able to talk about during the course of the campaign want to particularly congratulate president-elect Trump I think we all agree this is a stunning election and clearly an indication the American people would like to try something new and I know the speaker shares my view that we would like to see the country go in a different direction and intend to work with him to change courses uh to change the course uh for America he will have an opportunity to fill the Supreme Court vacancy as you know I said in February of this year to a hail of controversy that I thought it best that the American people decide who made this appointment to the Supreme Court I thought I was on pretty firm footing and doing that it had been 80 years since a vacancy created in the middle of a presidential election year was confirmed by the Senate you'd have to go back to 1888 to find the last time a vacancy on the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election year was confirmed by Senate of the opposite party of the president and so the American people have spoken and president Trump will send us a nominee I assume early next year so with that let me just throw it open and see what you'd like to discuss yeah Mr leader um considering how uh Republicans blocked meric Garland here uh there's ever been an outright filibuster of a Supreme Court Justice we have the a for a situation that's a little bit different why would you expect Democrats to handle any nomination from president-elect Trump any differently and if they do block it would you expect to return the favor with the nuclear option on Supreme Court Justices well it won't surprise you to know I'm not going to address what might happen in the context of a supreme court appointment what we do know is the the new president will fill the vacancy and um I expect it to be handled um in the way these Court appointments are typically handled and I would not anticipate any particular strategy in that the Democrats might employ uh to uh defeat it or what we might do in reaction to that did you bring that up with Senator Schumer today no we haven't discussed do you think comprehensive tax reform is possible next year and what are some of your other legislative priorities well we're going to be working with the new president on legislative priorities but he talked about tax reform and as some of you know um I think this is really important um in the early part of my service in the Senate we did the comprehensive tax reform back in 1986 and um President Reagan and Democratic speaker tip O'Neal had an agreement that it would be Revenue neutral to the government and to the maxim extent possible try to make America more competitive by lowering the rates for as many as possible possible President Obama and I and I know he had this conversation I'm sure with speaker Boehner and speaker Ryan as well talked about it the president the current president was not interested in making it Revenue neutral to the government in other words he wanted to get more money for the government if we want to make America truly competitive the goal ought to be when revenue is produced by the elimination of preferences use that to buy down the rates we have a particular acute problem with a corporate tax rate as everyone admits thereby creating the opportunity for inversions and the like and what I would prefer to see and I haven't had a chance to talk to the president about this yet is comprehensive tax reform that doesn't just lower taxes for the corporations who are having a hard time competing with the rest of the world but for most American businesses which are not corporations they're either es Corps or llc's and so we need to have an agreement on what we're advocating and um back in those days when we did it the last time there were plenty of Democrats on board for it Bill Bradley was a key player in it and hopefully that's the kind of thing we're going to have some bipartisan agreement on and actually make some progress to the country Senator m senat m you've talked before about how in 2018 Republicans have a very favorable map um it's very likely that you'll have the majority through until your own next election in 2020 are you starting to think about what kind of Legacy you'll have or what kind of stamp you can make on America with these next four years no we haven't even started the next Congress yet there'll be plenty of time to talk about legacies later send call yeah um I wondered if you had a preference for how long you'd like to fund the government that's going to come up in about a month would you want to go uh CR just until Trump takes over or are you thinking an Omnibus what is what is your where's your head at on that really haven't talked about that uh there are two priorities it seems to me for the lame dug the issue raised how how are you going to fund the government and second excuse me second the 21st century cures Bill the president's interested in Precision medicine part of that the vice president's interested in the cancer moonshot part of it I'm interested in the regenerative medicine part of it C Alexander and uh chairman Upton have done terrific work on this I'd like to see us finish that important new measure this year and the president and I discussed those two matters um this morning uh in June you expressed uh concerns about Donald Trump uh his comments about Hispanics and potentially harming the Republican party's relationship with Hispanics similar L Goldwater did with African-Americans I'm wondering after last night after this campaign do you still share those concerns you still have those concerns number one and number two do you support his Central policy idea to build a wall on the border with Mexico well I'm not going to go back and relitigate the events of the past we have a new president I'd like for him to see get off on a positive start and I think we should look forward and not backward and kind of rehash and relitigate the various debates we had both internally and the Democrats over the past year what about the wall that's that's a c we're going to be talking to the president about his agenda border security is important I think even our Democratic friends realize we haven't done a very good job of that and U achieving border security is something I think ought to be high on the uh list do you have a pref personal preference on the wall I I I want to try to achieve border security in whatever way is the most effective go Senator uh do the election results signal an end to the war on coal which you talked about and if so how does that affect your agenda in the next Congress and what does that mean for coal jobs in Kentucky well you know the uh the war on coal is not a result of any legislation we passed here one of the things I hope the new president he mentioned this during the campaign will do is take a look at all of the unilateral actions that the president took both through executive orders and Regulatory U overreach of one kind or another and the coal industry is a perfect example of that there were a lot of others uh and see how much he can undo of the unilateral actions the president took all by himself which would not require us um so I think in looking at why the countries had such slow growth the most tepid recovery after a deep recession since World War Two overregulation is the principal reason why I'm pretty conf confident the president didn't have one year of 3% growth and you saw a whole lot of people who voted for the new president yesterday frustrated they might not have put it this way but the lack of growth is the reason for the lack of opportunity and jobs we got to get this economy going again we got to take our foot off the break and put it on the accelerator and much of that can be done by the president alone because much of the problem has been created by this President alone so we'll be working with the administ ation to make suggestions about what kind of unilateral action he can take to undo some of this regulatory overreach which has slowed the economy so much and and Cole is a good example that can you characterize how you see the Senate majority's relationship with president-elect Trump is it to be a partner is it to be a facilitator of his agenda and do you think he shares your perception of the role of a senate majority in his coming term well I know he's really happy he's we still have a republican majority and uh we look forward to working with him I think most of the things that he's likely to Advocate we're going to be enthusiastically for where we have differences of opinion I expect to discuss them privately and not sort of hashing them out in public but the goal will be to try to get on the same page to try to turn the country in a different direction look we've had a tutorial here over the last eight years a big government taxes regulation big debts we know what doesn't work you do all of this stuff you get slow growth so in order to get the country going again we need to undo much of that and the good news is a lot of it was done by the president by himself so we're going to I think be enthusiastically supportive almost all the time and where we have differences we'll talk about them privately and see if we can work them out Senator McConnell senat MN senat McConnell what's your plan on Healthcare going forward do you plan on repealing Obamacare right away it's a pretty high item on our agenda as you know and um I would be shocked if we didn't U move forward to keep our commitment to the American people it was the single worst piece of legislation among many bad pieces of legislation uh passed in the first two years of the Obama presidency the sooner we can go in a different direction the better specific T any chance that comes up in the Lan duck any chance that comes up under President Trump well you have to ask him but TPA is still in place if the next president wants to negotiate trade agreements he has the opportunity to do that and to send it up exting framework that President Obama has negotiated do you think it's that it's certainly not going to be brought up this year yeah and it' be up to discussions with the new president as you know I think president Le made it pretty clear he was not in favor of the current agreement but he has the latitude because TPA is in place through the next Administration to negotiate better deals as I think he would put it if he chooses to and sending them up to us for an expedited up or down vote yeah in September you and speaker Ryan both said you wanted to move spending bills on series of mini buses did the does the election outcome change that plan at all how you plan to move the Appropriations measures in well we'll be talking with a speaker and with the president about how to wrap up the spending this year you're asking me a procedural question I don't blame you for asking it but I don't know the answer to it right now we would like to finish funding the government this year exactly how to achieve that over a three-week period is always a matter for discussion how to package it um differences in the house versus the Senate but I would like to wrap up the business of funding the government in this fiscal year this calendar year um going back to the Affordable Care Act do you plan to use budget reconciliation for the repeal and replacement or do you plan to reach out to Senator you're asking me a question you know I'm not going to answer all of that is underway I I think let's just stipulate that every single Republican thought Obamacare was a mist stake without exception that's still our view and you can expect us with a new president who has the same view to address that issue do you expect to support uh president-elect Trump's stated goals of withdrawing from NATO and forging a closer alliance with Russia yeah look I again that's sort of like manu's question sort of go back and relitigate various things that were said during the past year I want to look forward I will say for myself I think the NATO alliance is every bit as important today as it ever was I think Article 5 means something you attack any member of NATO you have us to deal with I want the Russians to understand that fully PA Senator uh in the last time there was a unified control of the White House the Senate and the house your belief was that the Democrats in 20091 acted too fast on their own unilaterally with no real B bipartisanship on stimulus uh ACA dodf Frank how do you avoid those mistakes given the the views of your voters Republican based voters right now well let me just answer it sort of broadly I think it's always a mistake to misread your mandate and frequently new majorities think it's going to be forever nothing is forever in this country we have an election every two years right on schedule we have had since 1788 and so uh I don't think we should act as if we're going to be in the majority forever we we've been given a temporary lease on power if you will and I think we need to use it responsibly I think what the American people are looking for is results and to get results in the Senate as all of you know it requires some democratic participation and cooperation uh we were able to do that during the first Obama tenure and the deals for example that I negotiated with Biden on three different occasions and um we are going to be looking for bipartisan support and I think uh overreaching after an election is generally speaking a mistake McConnell uh one of the items that has been on President elect's agenda has been Congressional term limits which my memory is is not something something that you've been a particular fan of uh what would you say to whether or not that would have any uh chance of daylight I say we have ter limits now they're called elections and it will not be on the agenda in the Senate Senator yeah any chance that um now that Republicans control all the you know aspects of the government then you might reconsider the earmark ban or moror I don't think so Senator Mell when you talk about bipar issues Criminal Justice Reform is something that has support on both sides of the aisle do you think that that is something you could look at in a new Congress Donald Trump hasn't talked about it much he's talked about Law and Order but he hasn't waited specifically on any other legislation well in terms of scheduling in the Senate as I think you already know we have some pretty serious divisions among Republicans on that I wouldn't rule it out um I don't want to uh speak for the speaker but I he's he's he's said something about whether or not they might tackle it um so that might be a good question to ask him um if they send a bill over to us we'll take a good hard look at it but but it is a pretty spirited debate within uh our conference and we have really not on a philosophical basis I have some very conservative members who are in favor of it and who are opposed to it so it didn't look to me like a good agenda item for us at this point but I wouldn't want to rule it out for next Congress senator yeah Senator M back to the Supreme Court issue could you just help us understand how much advising and how much consenting you'll be doing well I I was really pleased that the president elect was already asking for Our advice as you know many of us made suggestions when he put together a list of prospective nominees he was in effect asking for Our advice and I think he will be open to that and I for one intend to take advantage of it I've got a few suggestions I'd like to make that I won't mention to you but I you know I think I think he's open to our suggestions about that and I think that's good I think it's the way it ought work yeah Ty you uh mentioned a few things in the Lan like you didn't mention uh tax extenders is that an issue that will be in play over the next few weeks or two you know I we you know I I'm not sure we're doing extenders are we I don't know the answer to that that's the best answer when you don't know just say you don't know yeah um you and Senator re have been famously at L heads for years now we both like Bryce Harper we both pull for the Nets and we were both sad that the gats didn't make it past the first round again and I'm with you on all this could I just ask you though to expand on your thought on your relationship with Senator Schumer and you expected different relationship um what sort of does he bring to the table that you maybe can work with or will be trouble area yeah look I I think we're getting along F I know you you guys like to write these personality pieces he's he's got a job to do and I got a job to do I I respect him I think he's very smart and um I I think we'll be fine we we both have our roles to play I don't expect him to enthusiastically embrace my agenda on the other hand um to do things in the Senate you have to have some bipartisan support unless you're like the Democrats in 09 and 10 with 60 votes and then they paid a big price for it two years later which sort of gets back to Paul's uh question earlier Senor Mell can you describe your relationship with Governor Pence and do you expect him to be kind of a chief Lea on to Capitol Hill given his govern well we all really like U Mike Pence I if you've asked any of us who've served with him everybody likes him we all thought it was a great choice that uh president-elect Trump made and picking him I would just mention the way vice president Cheney worked with us uh he he was at many of our Tuesday lunches and you know Dick Cheney was a classic guy who didn't necessarily say anything all the time but he was like a sponge absorbing um what our concerns were and he he acted almost like President Bush is Senate Le aison and I'm I've mentioned that to vice president Pence and I hope he will uh attend our Tuesday policy lunches when he's in town and uh kind of be our liaison between the administration and the Senate much like vice president Cheney was yeah um regarding the majority uh keeping the majority uh the Senate leadership fund said that when the Democrats started to to raise a lot of money and put them in these competitive Senate races that you personally quote set up a flare sent up a flare to Republican donors to try to raise some more money for the for the effort to keep the majority can you tell me a little bit well you know what I did was to call people's attention around the country call their attention to the fact that this group existed it was obviously operated by people that that I've known well for years and I knew what their purpose was because they announced it their purpose was to try to help us uh keep uh the Republican Senate so sure I I praised them and um made sure everybody was aware of their existence what was the key moment though when did you feel like you had to start I don't know that it was a key moment uh I recommended that that this group be set up which is about all I could do legally recomend represented they be set up a couple of years ago because I felt like there was no sort of outside group grp that was sort of looking out for us like the Senate majority pack was looking out for the Democrats there are a lot of entrepreneurs on the right groups you've all read about and written about you know all from my point of view doing good stuff but nobody was completely focused on the Senate and so I was pleased that they came into existence and I think all indications are they made a difference you mentioned that uh you think that there's a lot of executive orders and Regulatory Act that the uh new president will get rid of specifically on the climate plan the clean power plan do you think that he'll just drop that court case or what's your expectation and what would you advise them to do that would sure be my hope I mean right away or what's your that would sure be my hope day one would be a good idea yeah what do you say to um undocumented immigrants in a country right now who might be uncertain about what their Futures are with Donald Trump elected president yeah I'm I'm not going to discuss the immigration issue today um we'll be discussing that internally with the new Administration uh in the coming coming months I'm going to take one more yeah uh so president-elect Trump didn't win the popular vote as it looks like now um a does he have a mandate and B what do he the mandate to do well we've been there before you know that happened in 2000 and the American people understand that if you you get 270 electoral votes you're president and I'd like to compliment vice president Gore you know he conceded he didn't run around saying we ought to amend the Constitution to get rid of the Electoral College he accepted the results of the system that we have and uh secretary Clinton did the same thing to accredit this morning so the election is over we know who won and we going to move on from there and do the best we can for the American people thanks a lot everybody",

        "transcript": "the majority leader today I want to touch on a topic that as I announced recently I'm going to continue to speak about in the coming weeks and months on the Senate floor and that's the right of free speech the fundamental right is one of our most cherished it forms the beating heart of our democracy it says to the core of our civic identity yet these days it seems to be coming under increasing threat all across our country the challenge it faces are different from what we've seen in the recent past but we want to confront these two if we are to preserve the right for future generations that's certainly what I intend to do and I know others share that commitment and I hope more colleagues will join in this effort as well our colleagues know this is a topic that I've devoted a large part of my career to throughout the Obama years I warned that our ability to freely engage in civic life and organized in defense of our beliefs was under coordinated assault from the administration that appeared determined to shut up anyone anyone who challenged these efforts to suppress speech were well documented they extended throughout the federal government and they were often aided by the Obama administration's allies here in Congress there were threats before then as well I know because I took up the fight against many of them sometimes it was a lonely battle often it was an unpopular one but in my view was necessary because whether the threats to free speech came from the IRS or the Obama administration's SEC they shared a similar goal to shut down or scare off the stage those who chose to think differently today however the threat to speech to free speech is evolving the speech suppression crowd made on longer control the levels the levels of federal power but it hasn't given up its commitment to silencing those with an opposing view yesterday in the Judiciary Committee chairman Grassley held a hearing to explore the worsening problem of a lack of tolerance on college campuses imagine that college campuses of all places for the views of others lack of tolerance and college campuses for the views of others one of the witnesses at the hearing was Floyd Abrams our former colleague Senator Moynihan rightly described as the most significant First Amendment lawyer of our age mr. Abrams noted that we're witnessing an extraordinarily perilous moment with respect to free speech on campuses where too many students seem to want to see and hear only views they already hold and to prevent others from hearing views and with which they differ so what could account for this a profound lack of information is one answer for example whatever incites a study where quote nearly a third of college students could not even identify the First Amendment as the one that deals with freedom of speech the day before across the street the Supreme Court reminded us of the importance of a vibrant right of free speech where its exercise does not depend upon the sufferance of the government in striking down the disparagement clause of federal trademark law the court reminded us of what too many of those on college campuses appear not to have learned and to many others seem to have forgotten speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend the foundation for individual rights and education estimates there were 43 reported instances of revoked speaking invitations or similar efforts to block speakers on campus just last year that's double the number recorded the previous year it's more than 700 percent higher than the six students recorded back in 2000 and the trend is getting worse not simply in terms of the overall number of incidents but more worryingly in terms of the growing aggressiveness of those efforts this year alone there have been multiple multiple instances of intimidation violence and rioting at universities across the country there's been nasty and thuggish behavior aimed at suppressing speech sadly it is often succeeded as USA Today put it in a recent editorial in just the place where the clash of ideas is most valuable students are shutting themselves off two points of view they don't agree with at the moment when young minds are supposed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of arguments they're answering challenges to their beliefs with anger with violence instead of facts and reason that you're worried all of us regardless of party regardless of ideology hearing criticism of one's beliefs and learning the benefits of others learning the beliefs of others is simply training for life in a democratic society it doesn't mean one has to agree with those opinions but no one is served by trapping oneself and others in cocoons of ignorance that's hardly the recipe for free and informed society to quote Frederick Douglass to suppress free speech is a double wrong because it violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker just as it was not right during the Obama years for Americans to endure harassment or incur crippling expenses because the government didn't like what they believed it certainly is not right today for Americans to live in the shadow of fear simply because they dare to speak up or think differently or support a candidate or a cause that the speech suppression crowd may disagree with it really doesn't matter who you are or whether what you're saying is popular these rights do not exist to protect what's popular they exist precisely to protect what isn't that's one reason I've long opposed ideas like the flag-burning constitutional amendment doesn't mean I agree that the flag should be burned of course I don't disagree strongly but it's the principle that matters because the moment we allow ourselves to believe that some people stand outside the free speech protections of the First Amendment then we're all in trouble all of us the growing trend of intolerance we're seeing has taken many forms lately but the underlying hostility to free speech has not changed as I noted earlier in recent years the threat had often come from the federal government these days the threat tends to come from different quarters there have been many high profile incidences of speech suppression and violence at universities across the country in particular but it would be a mistake to think that this problem is isolated to college campuses the bottom line for me is this we simply cannot allow this trend of violence and intimidation to become the new normal in our country this is a really serious problem it deserves serious attention solutions will not come simply they will not be found in a single piece of legislation as President Reagan famously put it freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didn't pass it on to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on to them to do the same and that mr. president is what we're called upon to do again now to inform to engage to empower in the end to inspire a new generation to defend a fundamental right for future generations just as past generations did for us that's what I aim to do by continuing this dialogue here on the Senate floor from this platform I'll continue to raise the importance of free speech outline the threats it faces and do what I can to inform and encourage Americans to rally in its defence others are using their platforms to advance similar goals as chairman Grassley did yesterday I hope more will join as this discussion continues because free speech is crucial to who we are as Americans regardless of party and we owe it to few to future generations to do what we can today to defend",

        "transcript": "let me just thank the people of Indiana for giving us a great upset victory tonight I know all the pundants thought we were supposed to lose but that apparently was not what the people of Indiana concluded um I understand that secretary Clinton thinks that this campaign is over I've got some bad news for her uh uh tonight we won a great victory in Indiana uh next week we're going to be in West Virginia we think we got a real shock uh to win in that great state then we're going to Kentucky and we're going to Oregon we think we have a pretty good chance to win there as well then we're going to another bunch of other states uh culminating in the largest state uh in the United States with the most delegates and that is the state of California we think we have a pretty good chance to win there and I think think that as more and more delegates uh to the Democratic Convention take a hard look uh at which candidate is generating the kind of enthusiasm excitement vter turnout that we need to make sure that somebody like a Donald Trump does not become president I think you're going to see more and more delegates concluding that that candidate uh is Bernie Sanders and the reason for that is that the issues that we are talking about in this campaign are the issues that are on on the hearts and minds of the American people the American people are tired of working longer hours for low wages and seeing almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1% they are tired of super Pacs and a corrupt campaign Finance system that allows billionaires to buy elections they're tired of a broken criminal justice system which enables us to have more people in jail than any other country on Earth they are worried about the future for their children and they understand that unless we create an economy that works for all of us and not just the 1% their kids are going to have a lower standard of living than they do and we're going to see the end of the American dream and we are not going to allow that to happen and the American people understand that in this great country we can do what every other major industrialized country on earth is doing and that is guaranteeing Health Care to all people as a right and to guarantee Paid Family and Medical Leave and by the way to demand when we have so much income and wealth inequality that Donald Trump and the billionaire class start paying their fair share of taxes so we feel great about tonight not only in winning here in Indiana and accumulating some more delegates but also gaining the momentum we need to take us to the Finish Line uh and we are you know we started this campaign uh way way way behind uh nobody I think would have dreamed uh that here at this particular Point uh in May of 2016 Not only would we be here but we would be winning elections but we are so I I sense a great deal of momentum I I sense some great uh victories coming and I think that while the path is narrow and I do not deny that for a moment uh I think we can pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States and in fact become the nominee uh for the uh Democratic party and then once we secure that position I have absolute confidence that we are going to defeat Donald Trump uh in the general election thank you Senator Sanders uh after tonight it seems that Donald Trump is going to become the likely uh GOP nominee will you commit now to saying whether or not you think he is a racist look I don't have to label I think that he virtually every day has insulted one group of people or another whether it is Mexicans and Latinos whether it is Muslims uh whether it is women whether it is Veterans whether it is African-Americans let us never forget that before Trump became uh a candidate for president he was one of the leaders of the so-called Bera movement a movement which tried to delegitimize the presidency of the first African-American President we have ever had I'll let people put the American people decide the appropriate label uh but this is a man who does not have the demeanor uh does not have the policy background or the ideas to become president of the United States I would love to run against them and I'm absolutely confident that not only we would beat them but we'd beat them by a pretty large number how does the win in Indiana fundamentally change the race obviously your delegate count is it's going to give us a great deal of momentum because I think there are many in the media like you and others who have decided that the campaign is over well I guess the people of Indiana did not quite agree with that assessment you know and I think you may be surprised to find out that the folks and I'm not predicting you know I don't know what's going to happen but the people in West Virginia may not agree with that assessment and the people of Oregon may not agree with that assessment the people in our largest state California may not agree with that assessment so we think we understand and I do not deny it for one second that we have an uphill battle in front of us uh but I think we have a path toward Victory although it is a narrow path our goal is twofold number one to win a majority of pledged delegates uh number two it is to make sure that in those states where we have won Landslide victories you know 65 70% of the votes that the super delegates in those States listen to their constituents and vote the way their constituents voted in their State's primaries or caucuses and thirdly we are going to make the case to the super delegates many of them by the way came on board Hillary Clinton's campaign before I was even an announced candidate they were there way back when well the world has changed in the last year and I believe that we will be able to make the case to many of those superdelegates that what is most important is not whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is the nominee what is most important is that we do not allow someone like a Donald Trump to become president of the United States and I think that according to every poll that I have seen in the last month Bernie Sanders defeats Donald Trump in the National polls by greater margins than does Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders beats uh Donald Trump by greater margins than Hillary Clinton in Battleground state after Battleground state after Battleground state in other words I think the objective evidence is that I am the strongest candidate to prevent the Trump from becoming president Senator have you been Senator you said yourself this week that you would have to win 65% of the remaining delegates to match Clinton and pledge delegates it's not looking like Indiana is going to be that kind of landslide it's a start it's a start I'm looking forward to there are other states to come and we are looking forward to winning in West Virginia uh looking forward to winning in Kentucky looking forward to winning in Oregon and as you know the state that has the most delegates is obviously California and we already have a a strong ground game in California we we have sent a lot of our people to California uh we're going to run an unprecedented campaign in California uh and with the help of the American people uh who have helped us so much right now with those $27 contributions at Bernie sanders.com you know we have made history we have 7.3 million campaign contributions Bernie sanders.com and with the help of the American people we're going to have the resources we need to win in California Senator your fundraising dropped off pretty significantly you know I read an article in New York times those was the word you use plunged how do we compare to Hillary Clinton she ended up with a few dollars more than we did but for you it Dro for just we about record-breaking the issue is I think we raised somebody correct me wrong $26 million $26 million in a month that is a pretty good sum of money from where I come from when we began this campaign nobody ever dreamed probably we'd raise $26 million for the whole campaign let alone in one month yeah so our numbers went down and Hillary Clinton beat us by a few dollars this is we're taking on the most powerful political organization in America she raised $600,000 more than I do didn't see the New York Times make that point so we feel we feel pretty good and we feel that today's Victory will probably help us but look we have enough money you know everybody always wants more money I don't have a super pack secretary Clinton has a super pack but we have enough money to run a strong and winning campaign throughout how do you plan to maximize those resources to take you through California because that's a very expensive California is an outrageously expensive state in terms of media you're right and clearly we're not going to be spending $100 million or whatever it takes on media in California so we have to decide the best way to allocate our resources I think that what the focus of our campaign will be actually what it has been up to now and that is we're going to do a whole lot of rallies you know California has a lot a lot of large and and great cities and I think what we are going to end up doing we have brought out in this campaign up to today over 1.1 million Americans to rallies that we have held I don't know I could be wrong in this I don't know that anyone has brought out more I may be wrong about that but that's my impression Senator we're going to go to California and when we go to California you're going to see very large rallies up and down that beautiful state last question Lauren okay uh Senator today uh Donald Trump has been called a presumptive nominee they've their reports they're ramping up for the general election any concern that by extending the Democratic primary that it's going to set Democrats at a disadvantage from July not at all if you look at the polling out there there was a poll came out yesterday or today and they asked the American people uh has the Democratic primary process invigorated the Democratic party is it good for the Democratic Party by very large numbers the American people say yes what we are doing in this campaign and I am extremely proud of it we are literally bringing millions of people into the political process and the way you bring people into the political process is you engage in a serious issue oriented campaign and people come out and they hear the points of view of secretary Clinton they hear my points of view they get involved and you know what those people then vote in the general election so I have no doubt zero doubt that what we have done in this campaign what we are doing now and what we will do in the next 6 weeks is good for the Democratic party and it will result in a higher voter turnout and let me conclude by saying this Democrats and progressives win elections when the voter turnout is high Republicans win elections when the voter turnout is low and when people are demoralized I'm going to do everything that I can to make sure that in November we have a very high voter turnout thank you all thanks everybody [Applause]",

thank you New Hampshire shortly after the polls close secretary Clinton called and was very gracious in her congratulations I thank her for her call and I congratulate her and her supporters for the vigorous campaign they ran in New Hampshire and let me take this opportunity to thank the many many thousands of volunteers here in the granite state who work so tirelessly our volunteers worked Night and Day made phone calls and knocked on a heck of a lot of doors and we won because of your energy thank you all so much and I I want to thank Julia bonds and our great campaign [Applause] staff together we have sent a message that will Echo from Wall Street to Washington from Maine to California and that is that the government of our great country belongs to all of the [Music] people and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors and their super Pats nine months ago we began our campaign here in New Hampshire we had no campaign organization we had no money and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America and tonight with what appears to be a record-breaking vote a turnout because of a huge voter turnout and I say huge we won because we horest the energy and the excitement that the Democratic party will will need to succeed in November what happened here in New Hampshire in terms of an enthusiastic and aroused electorate people who came out in large numbers that is what will happen all over this country and let us never forget Democrats and progressives win when voter turnout is high Republicans win when people are demoralized and voter turnout is [Applause] low tonight we serve notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign Finance system that is undermining American democracy and we will not accept a rigged economy in which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages while almost all new incomeon weth goes to the top [Applause] 1% I want to take this opportunity again to congratulate secretary Clinton and her organization and supporters for waging a vigorous campaign I hope that in the days ahead we can continue to wage a strong issue oriented campaign and bring new people into the political process but I also hope that we all remember and this is a message not just to our opponents but to those who support me as well that we will need to come together in a few months and unite this party and this nation because the right-wing Republicans we oppose must not be allowed to gain the [Applause] [Music] presidency as we all remember the last time Republicans occupied the White House their trickle down economic policies drove us into the worst economic downturn since the depression of the 1930s no we will not allow huge tax breaks for billionaires we will not allow ta huge cuts to Social Security veterans needs Medicare Medicaid and education no we will not allow back into the White House a political party which is so beholden to the fossil fuel industry that they cannot even acknowledge the scientific reality of climate change Let It Go do anything about it the people of New Hampshire have sent a profound message to the political establishment to the economic establishment and by the way to the media establishment what the people here have said is that given the enormous crisis facing our country it is just too late for the same old same old establishment politics and establishment economics the people want real change what the American people are saying and by the way I hear this not just from progressives but from conservatives and from moderates is that we can no longer continue to have a campaign Finance system in which Wall Street and the billionaire class are able to buy elections Americans Americans no matter what their political view may be understand that that is not what democracy is about that is what alari is about and we will not allow that to continue I do not have a super pack and I do not want a super pack I am overwhelmed and I am deeply moved far more than I can express in words by the fact that our campaigns financial support comes from more than 1 million Americans who have made more than 3.7 million individual contributions that is more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of the United States up until this point in an election and do you know what that average contribution was [Applause] $27 I am going to New York City tonight and tomorrow but I'm not going to New York City to hold a fundraiser on Wall Street instead I'm going to hold a fundraiser right here right now Across America my request is please go to Bernie sands.com and contribute please help us raise the funds we need whether it's 10 bucks or 20 bucks or 50 bucks help us raise the money we need to take the fight to Nevada South Carolina and the states on super Tuesday so there it is that's our fundraiser pretty quick now what the American people understand is that our great country was based on a simple principle and that principle is fairness let me be very clear it is not fair when we have more income and wealth inequality today than almost any major country on Earth and when the top oneth of 1% now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90% that's not [Music] [Applause] fair it is not fair when the 20 wealthiest people in this country now own more wealth than the bottom half of the American people so you guys ready for a radical idea together we are going to create an economy that works for all of us not just the 1% and when Millions of our people are working for starvation wages yep we're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour and we are going to bring pay equity for women and when we need the best educated Workforce in the world yes we are going to make make public colleges and universities tuition free and for the millions of Americans struggling with horrendous levels of student debt we are going to substantially ease that burden in America people should not be financially distressed for decades for the crime the crime of trying to get a higher education that's absurd well my critics say you know Bernie that's a great idea you're into all this free stuff how you're gonna pay for it I will tell you how we're going to pay for it we're going to impose a tax on Wall Street speculation the greed the recklessness and the illegal behavior of Wall Street drove our economy to its knees the American people bailed out Wall Street now it's wall Street's time to help the middle class and when we talk about transforming America it means ending the disgrace of this country having more people in jail than any other country in the world disproportionately africanamerican and Latino not only are we going to fight to end institutional racism and a broken Criminal Justice System we are going to provide jobs and education for our young people not jails and incarceration and let me say that as a member of the energy Committee in the Senate and the environmental committee the debate is over climate change is real it is caused by human activity and it is already causing devastating problems in this country and around the world we have a moral responsibility to work with countries throughout the world to transform our Energy System away from fossil fuel to Energy Efficiency and sustainable [Applause] [Music] energy now I have been criticized during this campaign for many many things every single day that's okay that's all right they're throwing everything at me except the kitchen sink and I have the feeling that kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as [Applause] well but what our campaign is about is thinking big not small it's about having the courage to reject the status quo it's about saying that in a time when every major country on Earth guarantees Health Care to all of their people we should be doing the same in our great country in my view on the President Obama's leadership the Affordable Care Act has been an important step forward no question about it but we can and must do better 29 million Americans should not remain uninsured and even greater number should not be underinsured with large deductibles and co-payments we should not be paying by far the highest prices of in the world for prescription drugs at a time listen to this when the top three drug companies in this country made $ 45 billion do in profit last year that is an obscenity and let me tell you something when we make it to the White House when we make it to the White House the pharmaceutical industry will not continue to rip off the American people and further it makes no sense that as a nation we continue to spend far far more per capita than do the people of any other Nation all of whom guarantee healthare to all of their people and that is why I believe in a Medicare for all Single Payer program which will not only guarantee health care for all but will save the average middleclass family thousands of dollars a year in health care cost my friends we all know that we live in a dangerous and complex world as president I will defend this nation but I will do it responsibly I voted against the war in Iraq and that was the right vote while we must be relentless in combating terrorists who would do us harm we cannot and should not be the policemen of the world nor nor should we bear the burden of fighting terrorism alone in the Middle East the United States must be part of an International Coalition sustained by nations in the region that have the means to protect themselves together we must and will destroy Isis but we should do it in a way that does not put our young men and women in the military into Perpetual Warfare in the Quagmire of the Middle East my friends we must fix our broken immigration system that divides families and create a path toward citizenship for hardworking people who are living in the shadows we must strengthen and expand Social Security and increase the benefits that seniors and disabled vets receive so that people can live in dignity in their retirement we must rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and when we do that we create millions of decent paying jobs we must pursue the fight for women's rights for gay rights for disability rights we must against stronger and stronger opposition protect the right of a woman to control her own [Applause] body and we must protect the men and women who serve our nation in uniform and protect our veterans who put their lives on the line to defend [Music] us my friends we must tell the billionaire class and the 1% that they cannot have it all at a time of massive wealth and income inequality the wealthiest people and largest corporations in this country will start paying their fair share of taxes my friends I am the son of a Polish immigrant who came to this country speaking no English and having no money my father worked at every day of his life and he never made a whole lot my mom and dad and brother and I grew up in a small three and a half room rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn New York my mother who died at a young age always dreamed of moving out of that apartment getting a home of her own but she never realized that dream the truth truth is that neither one of my parents could ever have dreamed that I would be here tonight standing before you as a candidate for president of the United [Applause] States this is the promise of America and this is the promise we must keep alive for future Generations what began last week in Iowa what voters here in New Hampshire confirmed tonight is nothing short of the beginning of a political revolution it is it is a political revolution that will bring tens of millions of our people together it will bring together working people who have given up on the political process it will bring together young people who have never participated in the political [Applause] process it will bring together together blacks and whites Latinos asian-americans Native [Music] [Applause] Americans straight and gay male and female people who were born in America and people who immigrated [Applause] here we will all come together to say loudly and clearly that the government of our great nation belongs to all of us not just a few wealthy campaign contributors that is what this campaign is about that is what the political revolution is about so New Hampshire thank you again and now it's on thank you New Hampshire and now it's on to Nevada South Carolina and Beyond",

        "transcript": "I love best about Kamala Harris. Pamela Harris can't be bought. And she can't be bossed around. Now I first met Kamala in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash, the banks had flat out broken laws, cheated people, and stolen homes. Millions of Americans had lost their jobs, they're savings, their homes. Now I was setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau go see it. Pamela was protecting families as California's attorney general. You bet And Donald was scamming students at Trump University. Trying to make money off people losing their homes. Kamala Harris stepped up. She enforced the law. She fought the giant banks, and she delivered billions of dollars of help for families. And that Is the difference between a criminal and a prosecutor. You know what else I love about Kala? She gets it. We need to make life more affordable for working people. Yeah. Donald Trump, the felon. has no plans to lower costs for families. He doesn't know how and basically, he doesn't really care. When did he ever fill up a gas tank or worry about a grocery bill. The only bills he worries about. from his criminal defense lawyers. But Kamala She cares deep down, and she will take on the giant corporations that are squeezing American families. In fact, It's something she's done before during the California wildfires, she went after the price gougers. During the pandemic, we worked together in the Senate to stop price gouging and as president she will lower costs for your family. She'll take on the Wall Street firms that buy up millions of houses and apartments and then jack up the rent. She'll take on drug companies that charge an arm and a leg for prescriptions. She'll take on corporate monopolies that rip off consumers and billionaires who don't pay taxes. And she'll take on right-wing extremists who think they should decide who has access to abortion or IVF Tamala will protect abortion rights nationwide. Yeah. And there it is. Groceries, gas, housing, health care, taxes, abortion. Trust Donald Trump and JD fans to look out for your family. Shoot, I wouldn't let those guys. I wouldn't trust them to move my couch. We need The Kamala Harris. This election is about your family and your future. I've seen Kamala Harris fight. I've seen her win. And when it comes to our families and our futures, Kamala Harris is someone we can trust. So here it is. With joy in our hearts. Let's elect Kamala Harris, the next president of the United States.",
