## Data Preprocessing Python Package

- discuss the high-level aim of the package in the README, including a demonstration of how to use key features and a graphic of a diagram illustrating how the pieces of your package connect to one another. In addition, you must use draw.io or some other diagram software to create an image showing your program architecture. The point is, someone who has never looked at your code should be able to easily ground themselves in the high-level structure of what you’ve done by reading your
documentation.
